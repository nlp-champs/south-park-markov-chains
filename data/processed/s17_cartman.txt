17 1 Cartman "Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
"
17 1 Cartman "Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
17 1 Cartman "Kyle, this is a private conversation.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
"
17 1 Cartman "Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
"
17 1 Cartman "Who is that? Is that Toby
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
17 1 Cartman "You're what? What, you say?
"
17 1 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?
"
17 1 Cartman "See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
17 1 Cartman "That'd be what?
"
17 1 Cartman "I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
"
17 1 Cartman "Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
"
17 1 Cartman "Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
"
17 1 Cartman "That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
"
17 1 Cartman "Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
"
17 1 Cartman "No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
"
17 1 Cartman "What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
17 1 Cartman "No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
"
17 1 Cartman "Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
"
17 1 Cartman "Bill Clinton.
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
"
17 1 Cartman "I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
"
17 1 Cartman "I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
"
17 1 Cartman "Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
"
17 1 Cartman "Really? How big is my file?
"
17 1 Cartman "Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
"
17 1 Cartman "Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
"
17 1 Cartman "Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
"
17 1 Cartman "The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
"
17 1 Cartman "Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
"
17 1 Cartman "I don't know.
"
17 1 Cartman "Get their hands on what?  Dude... 
"
17 1 Cartman "You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
"
17 1 Cartman "You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
"
17 1 Cartman "It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
"
17 1 Cartman "Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
"
17 1 Cartman "It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
"
17 1 Cartman "I do toooo!
"
17 1 Cartman "Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
"
17 1 Cartman "...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
"
17 1 Cartman "It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
17 1 Cartman "What's this?
"
17 1 Cartman "I can be forgiven?
"
17 1 Cartman "For everything bad I've ever done?
"
17 1 Cartman "And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
"
17 1 Cartman "Thta's pretty kewl.
"
17 1 Cartman "I do, I love my country!
"
17 1 Cartman "I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
"
17 2 Cartman "I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
"
17 2 Cartman "That's more like it.
"
17 2 Cartman "Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
"
17 2 Cartman "You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
"
17 2 Cartman "You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
"
17 2 Cartman "Butters' dad killed his mom. 
"
17 2 Cartman "Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
"
17 2 Cartman "And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
"
17 2 Cartman "Alright, we've gotta do something.
"
17 2 Cartman "Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!""
"
17 2 Cartman "You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
17 2 Cartman "Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token!  What's up, bro?
"
17 3 Cartman """Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
"
17 3 Cartman "Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
"
17 3 Cartman "God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
"
17 3 Cartman "Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
"
17 3 Cartman "It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
17 3 Cartman "He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
"
17 3 Cartman "But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
"
17 3 Cartman "No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
"
17 3 Cartman "M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
"
17 3 Cartman "M'kay.
"
17 3 Cartman "No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token? How are you doing?
"
17 3 Cartman "That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
"
17 3 Cartman "No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
"
17 3 Cartman "No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Agreed.
"
17 3 Cartman "Hoh boy, here we go.
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
"
17 3 Cartman "This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
"
17 3 Cartman "I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
17 3 Cartman "It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
"
17 3 Cartman "It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
"
17 3 Cartman "Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, calm down.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
17 3 Cartman "Get to an airport!
"
17 3 Cartman "We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
"
17 3 Cartman "You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Everyone quiet! I have to think!
"
17 3 Cartman "I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Nah! 
"
17 3 Cartman "One of them is in the back!
"
17 3 Cartman "Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
"
17 3 Cartman "It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
"
17 3 Cartman "His name is Token.
"
17 3 Cartman "I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
"
17 3 Cartman "Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
"
17 3 Cartman "We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Come on! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
17 3 Cartman "A person. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Threatening all of us!
"
17 3 Cartman "What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Stand my ground?
"
17 3 Cartman "Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
17 3 Cartman "This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
"
17 3 Cartman "The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
"
17 3 Cartman "Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
"
17 3 Cartman "If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
"
17 3 Cartman "Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
"
17 3 Cartman "I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
"
17 3 Cartman "Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
"
17 3 Cartman "Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
"
17 3 Cartman "Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
"
17 3 Cartman "Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
"
17 3 Cartman "That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah. So bad.
"
17 3 Cartman "Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
"
17 3 Cartman "You interrupt people when they talk.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh man! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh boy.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, calm down.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh God, here we go again! 
"
17 5 Cartman "That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
17 5 Cartman "That sucks, dude.
"
17 5 Cartman "I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
17 6 Cartman "I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
"
17 6 Cartman "There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
"
17 6 Cartman "You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
"
17 6 Cartman "Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
"
17 6 Cartman "What? What joke? This is real!
"
17 6 Cartman "No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
"
17 6 Cartman "Thank you, Butters! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
17 6 Cartman "Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""
"
17 6 Cartman "I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
"
17 6 Cartman "I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
"
17 6 Cartman "I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
"
17 6 Cartman "No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
"
17 6 Cartman "But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
"
17 6 Cartman "You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
"
17 6 Cartman "Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
"
17 6 Cartman "Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
"
17 6 Cartman "You what??
"
17 6 Cartman "Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
"
17 6 Cartman "Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle, are you sure?
"
17 6 Cartman "Well alright. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
"
17 6 Cartman "I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"
17 6 Cartman "You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Huh? You comin'? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
"
17 6 Cartman "Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
"
17 6 Cartman "Small penis?!
"
17 6 Cartman "No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
"
17 6 Cartman "No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
"
17 6 Cartman "Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
"
17 7 Cartman "Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
"
17 7 Cartman "Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
"
17 7 Cartman "Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
"
17 7 Cartman "What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
"
17 7 Cartman "I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
"
17 7 Cartman "It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
"
17 7 Cartman "On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
"
17 7 Cartman "Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
"
17 7 Cartman "They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
17 7 Cartman "Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
"
17 7 Cartman "But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
"
17 7 Cartman "Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
"
17 7 Cartman "Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
"
17 7 Cartman "What do you mean?
"
17 7 Cartman "Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
"
17 7 Cartman "We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"
17 7 Cartman "That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
"
17 7 Cartman "What?
"
17 7 Cartman "...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
"
17 7 Cartman "That's right.
"
17 7 Cartman "We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
"
17 7 Cartman "Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
"
17 7 Cartman "Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
17 7 Cartman "God these guys are such dorks!
"
17 7 Cartman "Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
"
17 7 Cartman "The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
"
17 7 Cartman "You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
"
17 7 Cartman "Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
17 7 Cartman "What new Elmo doll?
"
17 7 Cartman "Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
"
17 7 Cartman "I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
17 7 Cartman "True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
"
17 7 Cartman "You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
"
17 7 Cartman "Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
"
17 7 Cartman "Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
"
17 7 Cartman "Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
"
17 8 Cartman "Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
17 8 Cartman "There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
"
17 8 Cartman "The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
17 8 Cartman "That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" 
"
17 8 Cartman "I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
"
17 8 Cartman "Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
"
17 8 Cartman "Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
17 8 Cartman "Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
"
17 8 Cartman "Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
"
17 8 Cartman "So what happens when the dragons show up?
"
17 8 Cartman "Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
"
17 8 Cartman "Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
"
17 8 Cartman "He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17 8 Cartman "Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
"
17 8 Cartman "Why don't you mind your own business?!
"
17 8 Cartman "Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
"
17 8 Cartman "It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
"
17 8 Cartman "That could be up to you.
"
17 8 Cartman "Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
"
17 8 Cartman "Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17 8 Cartman "Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
"
17 8 Cartman "Yeah!
"
17 8 Cartman "Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
"
17 8 Cartman "Hi, is Kenny home?
"
17 8 Cartman "Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
17 8 Cartman "I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
"
17 8 Cartman "You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
"
17 8 Cartman "Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
"
17 8 Cartman "That doesn't even make sense.
"
17 8 Cartman "You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
17 8 Cartman "Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
"
17 8 Cartman "Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
17 8 Cartman "Your CEOs?
"
17 8 Cartman "Uhhh, hmmm. What?
"
17 8 Cartman "Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
17 9 Cartman "He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
"
17 9 Cartman "Because, because what? Because he's cute?
"
17 9 Cartman "But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
17 9 Cartman "He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
"
17 9 Cartman "So what are you saying, Kyle?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
17 9 Cartman "Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
"
17 9 Cartman "We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
"
17 9 Cartman "Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
"
17 9 Cartman "Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
"
17 9 Cartman "I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
17 9 Cartman "Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude! Dude!
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude, shut the fuck up!
"
17 9 Cartman "He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
"
17 9 Cartman "God damn it, shut up!
"
17 9 Cartman "Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
"
17 9 Cartman "Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
17 9 Cartman "I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
"
17 9 Cartman "Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yesh, kewl.
"
17 9 Cartman "Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
"
17 9 Cartman "Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
"
17 9 Cartman "Yes, he did.
"
17 9 Cartman "It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
"
17 9 Cartman "What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
"
17 9 Cartman "Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
"
17 9 Cartman "Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
"
17 9 Cartman "What the hell is this?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
"
17 9 Cartman "Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
"
17 9 Cartman "They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17 9 Cartman "No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yay, XBox wins.
"
17 9 Cartman "We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
"
17 9 Cartman "The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
"
17 9 Cartman "You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
"
17 9 Cartman "I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
"
17 9 Cartman "The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
"
17 9 Cartman "Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Fuck 'em!
"
17 10 Cartman "You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
"
17 10 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
17 10 Cartman "I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
"
17 10 Cartman "Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
"
17 10 Cartman "Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 
"
17 10 Cartman "Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
"
17 10 Cartman "Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
"
17 1 Cartman "Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
17 1 Cartman "Kyle, this is a private conversation.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
"
17 1 Cartman "Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
"
17 1 Cartman "Who is that? Is that Toby
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
17 1 Cartman "You're what? What, you say?
"
17 1 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?
"
17 1 Cartman "See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
17 1 Cartman "That'd be what?
"
17 1 Cartman "I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
"
17 1 Cartman "Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
"
17 1 Cartman "Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
"
17 1 Cartman "That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
"
17 1 Cartman "Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
"
17 1 Cartman "Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
"
17 1 Cartman "No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
"
17 1 Cartman "What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
17 1 Cartman "No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
17 1 Cartman "Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
"
17 1 Cartman "Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
"
17 1 Cartman "Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
"
17 1 Cartman "Bill Clinton.
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
"
17 1 Cartman "I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
"
17 1 Cartman "I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
"
17 1 Cartman "Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
"
17 1 Cartman "Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
"
17 1 Cartman "Really? How big is my file?
"
17 1 Cartman "Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
"
17 1 Cartman "Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
"
17 1 Cartman "Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
"
17 1 Cartman "The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
"
17 1 Cartman "Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
"
17 1 Cartman "I don't know.
"
17 1 Cartman "Get their hands on what?  Dude... 
"
17 1 Cartman "You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
"
17 1 Cartman "You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
"
17 1 Cartman "It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
"
17 1 Cartman "Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
"
17 1 Cartman "It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
"
17 1 Cartman "I do toooo!
"
17 1 Cartman "Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
"
17 1 Cartman "...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
"
17 1 Cartman "It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
17 1 Cartman "What's this?
"
17 1 Cartman "I can be forgiven?
"
17 1 Cartman "For everything bad I've ever done?
"
17 1 Cartman "And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
"
17 1 Cartman "Thta's pretty kewl.
"
17 1 Cartman "I do, I love my country!
"
17 1 Cartman "I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
"
17 2 Cartman "I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
"
17 2 Cartman "That's more like it.
"
17 2 Cartman "Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
"
17 2 Cartman "You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
"
17 2 Cartman "You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
"
17 2 Cartman "Butters' dad killed his mom. 
"
17 2 Cartman "Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
"
17 2 Cartman "And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
"
17 2 Cartman "Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
"
17 2 Cartman "Alright, we've gotta do something.
"
17 2 Cartman "Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!""
"
17 2 Cartman "You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
17 2 Cartman "Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token!  What's up, bro?
"
17 3 Cartman """Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
"
17 3 Cartman "Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
"
17 3 Cartman "God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
"
17 3 Cartman "Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
"
17 3 Cartman "It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
17 3 Cartman "He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
"
17 3 Cartman "But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
"
17 3 Cartman "No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
"
17 3 Cartman "M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
"
17 3 Cartman "M'kay.
"
17 3 Cartman "No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token? How are you doing?
"
17 3 Cartman "That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
"
17 3 Cartman "No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
"
17 3 Cartman "No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Agreed.
"
17 3 Cartman "Hoh boy, here we go.
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
"
17 3 Cartman "This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
"
17 3 Cartman "I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
17 3 Cartman "It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
"
17 3 Cartman "It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
"
17 3 Cartman "Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, calm down.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
17 3 Cartman "Get to an airport!
"
17 3 Cartman "We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
"
17 3 Cartman "The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
"
17 3 Cartman "You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Everyone quiet! I have to think!
"
17 3 Cartman "I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Nah! 
"
17 3 Cartman "One of them is in the back!
"
17 3 Cartman "Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
"
17 3 Cartman "It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
"
17 3 Cartman "His name is Token.
"
17 3 Cartman "I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
"
17 3 Cartman "Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
"
17 3 Cartman "We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Come on! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
17 3 Cartman "A person. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Threatening all of us!
"
17 3 Cartman "What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
"
17 3 Cartman "Stand my ground?
"
17 3 Cartman "Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
17 3 Cartman "This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
"
17 3 Cartman "The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
"
17 3 Cartman "Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
"
17 3 Cartman "If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
"
17 3 Cartman "Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
"
17 3 Cartman "I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
"
17 3 Cartman "Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
"
17 3 Cartman "Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
"
17 3 Cartman "Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
"
17 3 Cartman "Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
"
17 3 Cartman "Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
"
17 3 Cartman "That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
"
17 3 Cartman "Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah. So bad.
"
17 3 Cartman "Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
"
17 3 Cartman "You interrupt people when they talk.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh man! 
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh boy.
"
17 3 Cartman "Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
"
17 3 Cartman "Token, calm down.
"
17 3 Cartman "Oh God, here we go again! 
"
17 5 Cartman "That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
17 5 Cartman "That sucks, dude.
"
17 5 Cartman "I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
17 6 Cartman "I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
"
17 6 Cartman "There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
"
17 6 Cartman "You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
"
17 6 Cartman "Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
"
17 6 Cartman "What? What joke? This is real!
"
17 6 Cartman "No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
"
17 6 Cartman "Thank you, Butters! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
17 6 Cartman "Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""
"
17 6 Cartman "I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
"
17 6 Cartman "I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
"
17 6 Cartman "I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
"
17 6 Cartman "No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
"
17 6 Cartman "But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
"
17 6 Cartman "You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
"
17 6 Cartman "Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
"
17 6 Cartman "Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
"
17 6 Cartman "You what??
"
17 6 Cartman "Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
"
17 6 Cartman "Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
"
17 6 Cartman "Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
17 6 Cartman "Kyle, are you sure?
"
17 6 Cartman "Well alright. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
"
17 6 Cartman "I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"
17 6 Cartman "You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Huh? You comin'? 
"
17 6 Cartman "Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
17 6 Cartman "Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
"
17 6 Cartman "Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
"
17 6 Cartman "Small penis?!
"
17 6 Cartman "No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
"
17 6 Cartman "No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
"
17 6 Cartman "Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
"
17 7 Cartman "Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
"
17 7 Cartman "Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
"
17 7 Cartman "Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
"
17 7 Cartman "What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
"
17 7 Cartman "I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
"
17 7 Cartman "It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
"
17 7 Cartman "On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
"
17 7 Cartman "Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
"
17 7 Cartman "They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
17 7 Cartman "Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
"
17 7 Cartman "But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
"
17 7 Cartman "Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
"
17 7 Cartman "Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
"
17 7 Cartman "What do you mean?
"
17 7 Cartman "Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
"
17 7 Cartman "We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"
17 7 Cartman "That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
"
17 7 Cartman "What?
"
17 7 Cartman "...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
"
17 7 Cartman "That's right.
"
17 7 Cartman "We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
"
17 7 Cartman "Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
"
17 7 Cartman "Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
17 7 Cartman "God these guys are such dorks!
"
17 7 Cartman "Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
"
17 7 Cartman "Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
"
17 7 Cartman "The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
"
17 7 Cartman "You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
"
17 7 Cartman "Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
17 7 Cartman "What new Elmo doll?
"
17 7 Cartman "Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
"
17 7 Cartman "I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
17 7 Cartman "True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
"
17 7 Cartman "You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
"
17 7 Cartman "Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
"
17 7 Cartman "Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
"
17 7 Cartman "Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
"
17 8 Cartman "Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
17 8 Cartman "There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
"
17 8 Cartman "The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
17 8 Cartman "That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" 
"
17 8 Cartman "I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
"
17 8 Cartman "Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
"
17 8 Cartman "Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
17 8 Cartman "Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
"
17 8 Cartman "Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
"
17 8 Cartman "So what happens when the dragons show up?
"
17 8 Cartman "Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
"
17 8 Cartman "Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
"
17 8 Cartman "He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17 8 Cartman "Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
"
17 8 Cartman "Why don't you mind your own business?!
"
17 8 Cartman "Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
"
17 8 Cartman "It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
"
17 8 Cartman "That could be up to you.
"
17 8 Cartman "Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
"
17 8 Cartman "Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17 8 Cartman "Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
"
17 8 Cartman "Yeah!
"
17 8 Cartman "Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
"
17 8 Cartman "Hi, is Kenny home?
"
17 8 Cartman "Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
17 8 Cartman "I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
"
17 8 Cartman "You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
"
17 8 Cartman "Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
"
17 8 Cartman "That doesn't even make sense.
"
17 8 Cartman "You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
17 8 Cartman "Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
"
17 8 Cartman "Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
17 8 Cartman "Your CEOs?
"
17 8 Cartman "Uhhh, hmmm. What?
"
17 8 Cartman "Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
17 9 Cartman "He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
"
17 9 Cartman "Because, because what? Because he's cute?
"
17 9 Cartman "But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
17 9 Cartman "He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
"
17 9 Cartman "So what are you saying, Kyle?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
17 9 Cartman "Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
"
17 9 Cartman "We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
"
17 9 Cartman "Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
"
17 9 Cartman "Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
"
17 9 Cartman "I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
17 9 Cartman "Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude! Dude!
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude, shut the fuck up!
"
17 9 Cartman "He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
"
17 9 Cartman "God damn it, shut up!
"
17 9 Cartman "Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
"
17 9 Cartman "Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
17 9 Cartman "I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
"
17 9 Cartman "Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yesh, kewl.
"
17 9 Cartman "Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
"
17 9 Cartman "Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
"
17 9 Cartman "Yes, he did.
"
17 9 Cartman "It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
"
17 9 Cartman "What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
"
17 9 Cartman "Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
"
17 9 Cartman "Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
"
17 9 Cartman "What the hell is this?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
"
17 9 Cartman "Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
"
17 9 Cartman "They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17 9 Cartman "No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
17 9 Cartman "Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
17 9 Cartman "Yay, XBox wins.
"
17 9 Cartman "We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
"
17 9 Cartman "The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
"
17 9 Cartman "You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
"
17 9 Cartman "I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
"
17 9 Cartman "The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
"
17 9 Cartman "Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
"
17 9 Cartman "Fuck 'em!
"
17 10 Cartman "You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
"
17 10 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
17 10 Cartman "I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
"
17 10 Cartman "Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
"
17 10 Cartman "Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 
"
17 10 Cartman "Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
"
17 10 Cartman "Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
"
