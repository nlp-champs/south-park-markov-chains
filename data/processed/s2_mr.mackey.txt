2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?  Yes, Stan?
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you…
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Boys, are you paying attention?
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?  Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?  Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?  Uh-oh.
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "You mean I'm fired?
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "But--
"
2 4 "Mr. Mackey" "Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??

"
2 11 "Mr. Mackey" "Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
"
2 11 "Mr. Mackey" "Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay?
"
2 11 "Mr. Mackey" "Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
"
