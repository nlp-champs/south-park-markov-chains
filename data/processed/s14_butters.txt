14 1 Butters "Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
"
14 1 Butters "I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
"
14 1 Butters "Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
"
14 1 Butters "Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
"
14 1 Butters "Oh no!
"
14 1 Butters "It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
"
14 1 Butters "Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"
14 1 Butters "There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
"
14 1 Butters "But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
"
14 1 Butters "No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
"
14 1 Butters "Haah! Leave me alone! 
"
14 1 Butters "Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
"
14 1 Butters "I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
"
14 1 Butters "Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
"
14 1 Butters "Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
"
14 2 Butters "Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
"
14 2 Butters "Aww. Dangit. 
"
14 2 Butters "Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
"
14 2 Butters "Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
"
14 2 Butters "I am?
"
14 2 Butters "Oh no. Which book was that?
"
14 2 Butters "I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
"
14 2 Butters "Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
"
14 2 Butters "Huh?
"
14 2 Butters "Oh, thanks.
"
14 2 Butters "I wrote that. 
"
14 2 Butters "Thank you! 
"
14 2 Butters "That's nice. 
"
14 2 Butters "Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
"
14 2 Butters "But, you told me I did!
"
14 2 Butters "Yeah, I'm broooding.
"
14 2 Butters "No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
"
14 2 Butters "I have to come right to my room after school.
"
14 2 Butters "Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
"
14 2 Butters "Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
"
14 2 Butters "Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
"
14 2 Butters "Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
"
14 2 Butters "Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
"
14 2 Butters "Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
"
14 2 Butters "Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
"
14 2 Butters "I know.
"
14 2 Butters "You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"
14 2 Butters "Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
"
14 2 Butters "What?
"
14 2 Butters "What?! Oh no!
"
14 2 Butters "Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
"
14 5 Butters "Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
"
14 5 Butters "How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
"
14 7 Butters "Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
"
14 7 Butters "The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
"
14 7 Butters "I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
"
14 7 Butters "Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
"
14 7 Butters "Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
"
14 7 Butters "Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
"
14 7 Butters "You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
"
14 7 Butters "Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
"
14 7 Butters "He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
"
14 7 Butters "You will?
"
14 8 Butters "Hey Eric.
"
14 8 Butters "Ahhh well oh- kay.
"
14 8 Butters "Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
"
14 8 Butters "I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
"
14 8 Butters "NASCA- NASCAR?
"
14 8 Butters "You're givin' away all your money??
"
14 8 Butters "You sure you want to do this?
"
14 8 Butters "Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
"
14 8 Butters "Hey Eric.
"
14 8 Butters "Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
"
14 8 Butters "Feel stupid yet?
"
14 8 Butters "All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"
14 8 Butters "Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
"
14 8 Butters "Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
"
14 8 Butters "But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
"
14 8 Butters "No, you're good. 
"
14 8 Butters "Really?
"
14 8 Butters "That was fast.
"
14 8 Butters "Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
"
14 8 Butters "Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
"
14 8 Butters "Eric, are you sure you can do this?
"
14 8 Butters "I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
"
14 8 Butters "There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
"
14 8 Butters "Eric?
"
14 8 Butters "Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
"
14 8 Butters "Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
"
14 8 Butters "How bad is it, doctor?
"
14 8 Butters "Well at least there's that.
"
14 8 Butters "Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
"
14 8 Butters "It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
"
14 8 Butters "You seemed really stupid, Eric.
"
14 8 Butters "Obama's fuckin' gay.
"
14 8 Butters "Pissin' me off!
"
14 8 Butters "Yeah, he's a champion alright.
"
14 8 Butters "Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
"
14 8 Butters "That's fuckin' gay as hell.
"
14 8 Butters "There you go. You're back on the track.
"
14 8 Butters "Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
"
14 8 Butters "I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
"
14 8 Butters "Huh?
"
14 8 Butters "Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
"
14 8 Butters "But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
"
14 9 Butters "Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
"
14 9 Butters "Are you being serious?
"
14 9 Butters "Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
"
14 9 Butters "Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14 10 Butters "Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
