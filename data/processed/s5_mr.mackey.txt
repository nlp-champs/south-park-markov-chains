5 1 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
"
5 5 "Mr. Mackey" "Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina.""  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. 
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" """That guy with the really big head.""
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Neither have I.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Right. 
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Why are you wearing a condom?
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Yes.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "And these... are the two areas most important to-
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "I go crazy.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Yeah. Hmm. 
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "G'oh, m'kay.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Huh, what's wrong?
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "I do.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "I want you. M'kay. 
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Well. No.
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh yeah. Woh. 
"
5 7 "Mr. Mackey" "Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. 
"
5 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
"
5 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
"
5 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
"
5 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
"
5 10 "Mr. Mackey" "It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" . Ohokahay, huhuh.
"
5 13 "Mr. Mackey" "You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. 
"
5 13 "Mr. Mackey" "We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
