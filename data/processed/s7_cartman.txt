7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
7 1 Cartman "Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
"
7 1 Cartman "What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
"
7 1 Cartman "No I don't remember that!
"
7 1 Cartman "No, because the aliens erased my memory!
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw dude, I hate repeats!
"
7 1 Cartman "SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha, very funny.
"
7 1 Cartman "Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
7 1 Cartman "Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
"
7 1 Cartman "Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
"
7 1 Cartman "You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
"
7 1 Cartman "Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Nope! It has to be Kyle!
"
7 1 Cartman "Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
"
7 1 Cartman "I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay. Okay okay. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
"
7 1 Cartman "Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
7 1 Cartman "All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
7 1 Cartman "No, go ahead. I'm dry.
"
7 1 Cartman "But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
"
7 1 Cartman "This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
7 1 Cartman "It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
"
7 1 Cartman "What are you doing, man?! 
"
7 1 Cartman "When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
7 1 Cartman "...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
"
7 1 Cartman "This is like my fifth time. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
"
7 1 Cartman "Santa!
"
7 1 Cartman "Oooo, very nice.
"
7 1 Cartman "How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Tell us about it!
"
7 1 Cartman "No.
"
7 1 Cartman "There's even World War Three to look forward to.
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "What is it, Chef?
"
7 2 Cartman "We didn't go to your comedy show.
"
7 2 Cartman "Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
"
7 2 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
"
7 2 Cartman "Can too!
"
7 2 Cartman "Oh God-damnit!!
"
7 2 Cartman "But they say I can't be in their club!!
"
7 3 Cartman "Put more clay on the balls.
"
7 3 Cartman "What a crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "You can't do that!
"
7 3 Cartman "You're an art teacher!
"
7 3 Cartman "We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
"
7 3 Cartman "Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
"
7 3 Cartman "Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
7 3 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
"
7 3 Cartman "Should be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yep. All set.
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
"
7 3 Cartman "Heh yeah, that that's right.
"
7 3 Cartman "No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
"
7 3 Cartman "It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
"
7 3 Cartman "So?
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, let's go! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Who cares??
"
7 3 Cartman "Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
"
7 3 Cartman "Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Damn!
"
7 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
7 3 Cartman "Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
"
7 3 Cartman "Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
"
7 3 Cartman "They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
"
7 3 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
"
7 3 Cartman "No need. I have one for you right here. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Is there anything else I can get for you?
"
7 3 Cartman "You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
"
7 3 Cartman "Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
"
7 3 Cartman "We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 3 Cartman "He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
"
7 3 Cartman "I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
"
7 3 Cartman "Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "And you feel like you have to confess.
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Won't be long, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
"
7 3 Cartman "They did?
"
7 3 Cartman "But can I still kill Kyyyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "Uh, can we see them-him-her?
"
7 3 Cartman "What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
"
7 3 Cartman "Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
"
7 3 Cartman "You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
"
7 3 Cartman "What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
"
7 3 Cartman "Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
"
7 3 Cartman "So... so then, how can you feel bad?
"
7 3 Cartman "...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
"
7 3 Cartman "What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
"
7 3 Cartman "For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
7 3 Cartman "Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
"
7 3 Cartman "It's over this way! Come on!
"
7 3 Cartman "So how are things, guys?
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
"
7 3 Cartman "Can't I? 
"
7 3 Cartman "Hi guys.
"
7 3 Cartman "I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
"
7 3 Cartman "My consciences just caught up with me.
"
7 3 Cartman "I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
"
7 3 Cartman "I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
7 3 Cartman "Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
"
7 3 Cartman "Hm.
"
7 4 Cartman "Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
"
7 4 Cartman "Bush is a Naizi
"
7 4 Cartman "...Eh the... Founding who? 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. M-maaaa.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
"
7 4 Cartman "I'm trying to have a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
"
7 4 Cartman "Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
"
7 4 Cartman "That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Benjamin Franklin?
"
7 4 Cartman "Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
"
7 4 Cartman "Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
"
7 4 Cartman "Or a really sweet one. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, here it goes! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ohhh awesome!!! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
"
7 4 Cartman "No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
7 4 Cartman "Super neato! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
"
7 4 Cartman "And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
7 4 Cartman "It's a bitch, ain't it?
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow.
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, how very very relevant.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow!
"
7 4 Cartman "Everyone, stop! Please! 
"
7 4 Cartman "If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
"
7 4 Cartman "I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""
"
7 4 Cartman "The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
"
7 5 Cartman "Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Miss Lopez, come on out here.

7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?

7 5 Cartman "Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
"
7 5 Cartman "Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.

7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?

7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
7 5 Cartman "Is nice?

7 5 Cartman "Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
"
7 5 Cartman "There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.

7 5 Cartman "Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
"
7 5 Cartman "Jennifer Lopez?
"
7 5 Cartman "Not me!
"
7 5 Cartman "I'm sure it was just a mistake.
"
7 5 Cartman "Shut your God-damned mouth!
"
7 5 Cartman "Nobody
"
7 5 Cartman "Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
"
7 5 Cartman "I will
"
7 5 Cartman "Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
"
7 5 Cartman "Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "What the hell are you doing?
"
7 5 Cartman "Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!

7 5 Cartman "Sleep!

7 5 Cartman "I told you this would happen. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.

7 5 Cartman "EHAGH!  Moooooommmm!

7 5 Cartman "S'aright.
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, balls!
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
7 5 Cartman "I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Stop doing what?
"
7 5 Cartman "Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
7 5 Cartman "Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
"
7 5 Cartman "Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys... Uh... Uh... 
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
"
7 6 Cartman "Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
"
7 6 Cartman "Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
7 6 Cartman "My God...
"
7 6 Cartman "What have you got, Marsh?
"
7 6 Cartman "Jesus, we're too late.
"
7 6 Cartman "Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
"
7 6 Cartman "Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
7 6 Cartman "The torso he would dump into the lake. 
"
7 6 Cartman "And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
"
7 6 Cartman "Looks like the game is over, old man! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
"
7 6 Cartman "Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
"
7 6 Cartman "Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
"
7 6 Cartman "No sign of forced entry.
"
7 6 Cartman "We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
"
7 6 Cartman "Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
"
7 6 Cartman "Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
"
7 6 Cartman "You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
"
7 6 Cartman "You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
"
7 6 Cartman "Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
"
7 6 Cartman "You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
"
7 6 Cartman "Stop playing games!
"
7 6 Cartman "That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
"
7 6 Cartman "I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
"
7 6 Cartman "Really?
"
7 6 Cartman "Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Follow me to the bathroom. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
"
7 6 Cartman "Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well pull harder!
"
7 6 Cartman "Try doin' it faster
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
"
7 6 Cartman "The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
"
7 6 Cartman "Let's go! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kyle! 
"
7 6 Cartman "I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 6 Cartman "Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
"
7 6 Cartman "Yeah! This was our hot lead!
"
7 6 Cartman "Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
"
7 6 Cartman "All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
"
7 6 Cartman "We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
"
7 6 Cartman "Kewl!
"
7 6 Cartman "Uh bonus?
"
7 6 Cartman "Me neither.
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
"
7 6 Cartman "Awwwwrrr-auugh. 
"
7 6 Cartman "We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
"
7 6 Cartman "Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
"
7 6 Cartman "Okay. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters?
"
7 6 Cartman "Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, keep tryin', Butters.
"
7 6 Cartman "A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
"
7 6 Cartman "Un oh...
"
7 6 Cartman "Bang bang bang... 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" 
"
7 6 Cartman "Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
"
7 6 Cartman "You did?
"
7 6 Cartman "Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
"
7 7 Cartman "Man, Indians have it good, huh?
"
7 7 Cartman "All right, let's go! 
"
7 7 Cartman "I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
"
7 7 Cartman "Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
"
7 7 Cartman "Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
"
7 7 Cartman "That's right!
"
7 7 Cartman "Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
"
7 7 Cartman "Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
7 7 Cartman "Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
"
7 7 Cartman "You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
"
7 8 Cartman "What? Tell us?
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
"
7 8 Cartman "What a dork!
"
7 8 Cartman "Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
"
7 8 Cartman "We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
"
7 8 Cartman "GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
"
7 8 Cartman "You're straight like a freeway!
"
7 8 Cartman "You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
"
7 8 Cartman "...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
7 8 Cartman "I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
"
7 8 Cartman "Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
"
7 8 Cartman "Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
"
7 8 Cartman "You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
7 8 Cartman "He's not our friend. 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
"
7 9 Cartman "God dammit! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
"
7 9 Cartman "Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
"
7 9 Cartman "Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
"
7 9 Cartman "It worked for Creed!
"
7 9 Cartman "You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
"
7 9 Cartman "Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
"
7 9 Cartman "I told you, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
"
7 9 Cartman "We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
"
7 9 Cartman "Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
"
7 9 Cartman "Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
"
7 9 Cartman "All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
"
7 9 Cartman "Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
"
7 9 Cartman "All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
"
7 9 Cartman "Almost there, you guys.
"
7 9 Cartman "Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
"
7 9 Cartman "I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
7 9 Cartman "No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
7 9 Cartman "So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh hey guys. How's it going?
"
7 9 Cartman "I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
7 9 Cartman "That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
"
7 9 Cartman "It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
"
7 9 Cartman "I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
"
7 9 Cartman "I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
"
7 9 Cartman "Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who are you?
"
7 9 Cartman "Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
"
7 9 Cartman "Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
"
7 9 Cartman "Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
"
7 9 Cartman "You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, we sure do.
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
"
7 9 Cartman "I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
"
7 9 Cartman "The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
"
7 9 Cartman "Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
7 9 Cartman "Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
"
7 9 Cartman "We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
"
7 9 Cartman "You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
"
7 9 Cartman "GOD DAMMIT!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
"
7 9 Cartman "OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
"
7 10 Cartman "With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
"
7 10 Cartman "I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
"
7 10 Cartman "Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
"
7 10 Cartman "Calm down! We cannot understand you!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, they're coming! 
"
7 10 Cartman "They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
"
7 10 Cartman "Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
"
7 10 Cartman "My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
7 10 Cartman "I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
7 10 Cartman "More old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people gone mad!
"
7 10 Cartman "So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
7 10 Cartman "No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
7 10 Cartman "Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
7 10 Cartman "I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Aw yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
7 11 Cartman "Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's joking? 
"
7 11 Cartman "You have AIDS?
"
7 11 Cartman "Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
7 11 Cartman "This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
7 11 Cartman "Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
7 11 Cartman "I have never been a dick to you.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hi Kyle. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What isn't it?
"
7 11 Cartman "...I don't understand the difference.
"
7 11 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Like what?
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's there?
"
7 11 Cartman "Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
7 11 Cartman "Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hey Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well what?
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
7 11 Cartman "So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
7 11 Cartman "I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
7 11 Cartman "Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
7 11 Cartman "For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
7 11 Cartman "A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
7 11 Cartman "According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
7 11 Cartman "Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
7 11 Cartman "Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
7 11 Cartman "Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
7 11 Cartman "Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
7 11 Cartman "The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
7 11 Cartman "There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
"
7 11 Cartman "No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
7 11 Cartman "We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
7 11 Cartman "Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What what what?
"
7 11 Cartman "UUuuugh!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
7 11 Cartman "They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
7 11 Cartman "We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
7 11 Cartman "Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
7 11 Cartman "We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
7 11 Cartman "It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
7 11 Cartman "We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
7 11 Cartman "Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
7 11 Cartman "We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
7 11 Cartman "I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
7 11 Cartman "We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"
7 11 Cartman """Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
"
7 11 Cartman "What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday to you. Happy- 
"
7 11 Cartman "We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
7 11 Cartman "But... Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Cartman "But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
7 11 Cartman "I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!

7 11 Cartman "Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me!

7 12 Cartman "Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
"
7 12 Cartman "Go kick his ass, Stan.
"
7 12 Cartman "Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
"
7 12 Cartman "They're just standing there, talking. 
"
7 12 Cartman "You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
"
7 12 Cartman "Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
7 12 Cartman "Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
"
7 12 Cartman "Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
7 12 Cartman "Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
7 12 Cartman "Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm going to kill myself. 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothing.
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Gross dude! 
"
7 13 Cartman "No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
7 13 Cartman "We're sorry.
"
7 13 Cartman "Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
7 13 Cartman "Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
"
7 13 Cartman "Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
7 13 Cartman "Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
7 13 Cartman "Got it! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
7 13 Cartman "Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
7 13 Cartman "Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow, a commercial?
"
7 13 Cartman "God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
7 13 Cartman "So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
7 13 Cartman "Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
7 13 Cartman "Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
7 13 Cartman "Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, ho-okay. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
7 13 Cartman "Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
7 13 Cartman "They're going to kill me! 
"
7 13 Cartman "The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys have to help me!
"
7 13 Cartman "Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
"
7 13 Cartman "If I go, you guys go!
"
7 13 Cartman "Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
7 13 Cartman "I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Aw awww!
"
7 14 Cartman "Right. What are we playing again?
"
7 14 Cartman "Got it. 
"
7 14 Cartman "What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
"
7 14 Cartman "Yeh-heah, right!
"
7 14 Cartman "What a whore! 
"
7 14 Cartman "Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
7 14 Cartman "God, what a fag!
"
7 14 Cartman "How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
"
7 14 Cartman "Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
7 14 Cartman "Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
7 15 Cartman "Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
7 15 Cartman "We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
7 15 Cartman "Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
7 15 Cartman "HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "What?
"
7 15 Cartman "No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
7 15 Cartman "You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
7 15 Cartman "Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
7 15 Cartman "It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
"
7 15 Cartman "This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
7 15 Cartman "You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
7 15 Cartman "Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
7 15 Cartman "We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
7 15 Cartman "You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
7 15 Cartman "Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
7 15 Cartman "Sweet.
"
7 15 Cartman "Look out!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus Christ.
"
7 15 Cartman "Which road?!
"
7 15 Cartman "Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
7 15 Cartman "But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
7 15 Cartman "How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
"
7 15 Cartman "How could you be so stupid!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
"
7 15 Cartman "We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
"
7 15 Cartman "Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
7 15 Cartman "And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
"
7 15 Cartman "It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
"
7 15 Cartman "Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
7 1 Cartman "Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
"
7 1 Cartman "What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
"
7 1 Cartman "No I don't remember that!
"
7 1 Cartman "No, because the aliens erased my memory!
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw dude, I hate repeats!
"
7 1 Cartman "SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha, very funny.
"
7 1 Cartman "Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
7 1 Cartman "Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
"
7 1 Cartman "Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
"
7 1 Cartman "You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
"
7 1 Cartman "Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Nope! It has to be Kyle!
"
7 1 Cartman "Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
"
7 1 Cartman "I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay. Okay okay. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
"
7 1 Cartman "Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
7 1 Cartman "All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
7 1 Cartman "No, go ahead. I'm dry.
"
7 1 Cartman "But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
"
7 1 Cartman "This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
7 1 Cartman "It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
"
7 1 Cartman "What are you doing, man?! 
"
7 1 Cartman "When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
7 1 Cartman "...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
"
7 1 Cartman "This is like my fifth time. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
"
7 1 Cartman "Santa!
"
7 1 Cartman "Oooo, very nice.
"
7 1 Cartman "How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Tell us about it!
"
7 1 Cartman "No.
"
7 1 Cartman "There's even World War Three to look forward to.
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "What is it, Chef?
"
7 2 Cartman "We didn't go to your comedy show.
"
7 2 Cartman "Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
"
7 2 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
"
7 2 Cartman "Can too!
"
7 2 Cartman "Oh God-damnit!!
"
7 2 Cartman "But they say I can't be in their club!!
"
7 3 Cartman "Put more clay on the balls.
"
7 3 Cartman "What a crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "You can't do that!
"
7 3 Cartman "You're an art teacher!
"
7 3 Cartman "We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
"
7 3 Cartman "Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
"
7 3 Cartman "Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
7 3 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
"
7 3 Cartman "Should be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yep. All set.
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
"
7 3 Cartman "Heh yeah, that that's right.
"
7 3 Cartman "No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
"
7 3 Cartman "It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
"
7 3 Cartman "So?
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, let's go! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Who cares??
"
7 3 Cartman "Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
"
7 3 Cartman "Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Damn!
"
7 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
7 3 Cartman "Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
"
7 3 Cartman "Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
"
7 3 Cartman "They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
"
7 3 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
"
7 3 Cartman "No need. I have one for you right here. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Is there anything else I can get for you?
"
7 3 Cartman "You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
"
7 3 Cartman "Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
"
7 3 Cartman "We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 3 Cartman "He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
"
7 3 Cartman "I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
"
7 3 Cartman "Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "And you feel like you have to confess.
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Won't be long, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
"
7 3 Cartman "They did?
"
7 3 Cartman "But can I still kill Kyyyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "Uh, can we see them-him-her?
"
7 3 Cartman "What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
"
7 3 Cartman "Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
"
7 3 Cartman "You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
"
7 3 Cartman "What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
"
7 3 Cartman "Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
"
7 3 Cartman "So... so then, how can you feel bad?
"
7 3 Cartman "...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
"
7 3 Cartman "What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
"
7 3 Cartman "For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
7 3 Cartman "Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
"
7 3 Cartman "It's over this way! Come on!
"
7 3 Cartman "So how are things, guys?
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
"
7 3 Cartman "Can't I? 
"
7 3 Cartman "Hi guys.
"
7 3 Cartman "I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
"
7 3 Cartman "My consciences just caught up with me.
"
7 3 Cartman "I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
"
7 3 Cartman "I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
7 3 Cartman "Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
"
7 3 Cartman "Hm.
"
7 4 Cartman "Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
"
7 4 Cartman "Bush is a Naizi
"
7 4 Cartman "...Eh the... Founding who? 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. M-maaaa.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
"
7 4 Cartman "I'm trying to have a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
"
7 4 Cartman "Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
"
7 4 Cartman "That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Benjamin Franklin?
"
7 4 Cartman "Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
"
7 4 Cartman "Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
"
7 4 Cartman "Or a really sweet one. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, here it goes! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ohhh awesome!!! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
"
7 4 Cartman "No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
7 4 Cartman "Super neato! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
"
7 4 Cartman "And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
7 4 Cartman "It's a bitch, ain't it?
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow.
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, how very very relevant.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow!
"
7 4 Cartman "Everyone, stop! Please! 
"
7 4 Cartman "If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
"
7 4 Cartman "I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""
"
7 4 Cartman "The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
"
7 5 Cartman "Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Miss Lopez, come on out here. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, you mean this one? 
"
7 5 Cartman "There we go, Saright?
"
7 5 Cartman "That's a very pretty dress. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez

7 5 Cartman "Nono, Jeh-

7 5 Cartman "Jeh
"
7 5 Cartman "Jennifer Lopez
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
"
7 5 Cartman "And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
"
7 5 Cartman "Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
7 5 Cartman "Is nice?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
"
7 5 Cartman "I agree. Those places are stupid.
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
"
7 5 Cartman "Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
"
7 5 Cartman "All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Yeah, I wanna leave.
"
7 5 Cartman "What?

7 5 Cartman "Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.

7 5 Cartman "What do they want?
"
7 5 Cartman "S'awright?

7 5 Cartman "What? What?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hello hello, are you still there?
"
7 5 Cartman "You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
"
7 5 Cartman "Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
"
7 5 Cartman "Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
"
7 5 Cartman "There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.

7 5 Cartman "Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
"
7 5 Cartman "Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
"
7 5 Cartman "Jennifer Lopez?
"
7 5 Cartman "Not me!
"
7 5 Cartman "I'm sure it was just a mistake.
"
7 5 Cartman "Shut your God-damned mouth!
"
7 5 Cartman "Nobody
"
7 5 Cartman "Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
"
7 5 Cartman "I will
"
7 5 Cartman "Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
"
7 5 Cartman "Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "What the hell are you doing?
"
7 5 Cartman "Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Moooommm!
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Heyesss.
"
7 5 Cartman "She's not here right now.
"
7 5 Cartman "NO!
"
7 5 Cartman "I'm not going out in his car.
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!

7 5 Cartman "NO!

7 5 Cartman "OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
"
7 5 Cartman "Aww crap.
"
7 5 Cartman "OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
"
7 5 Cartman "I told you this would happen. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
"
7 5 Cartman "EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
"
7 5 Cartman "You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
"
7 5 Cartman "What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!
"
7 5 Cartman "What news?
"
7 5 Cartman "S'aright.
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, balls!
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
7 5 Cartman "I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Stop doing what?
"
7 5 Cartman "Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
7 5 Cartman "Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
"
7 5 Cartman "Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys... Uh... Uh... 
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
"
7 6 Cartman "Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
"
7 6 Cartman "Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
7 6 Cartman "My God...
"
7 6 Cartman "What have you got, Marsh?
"
7 6 Cartman "Jesus, we're too late.
"
7 6 Cartman "Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
"
7 6 Cartman "Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
7 6 Cartman "The torso he would dump into the lake. 
"
7 6 Cartman "And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
"
7 6 Cartman "Looks like the game is over, old man! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
"
7 6 Cartman "Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
"
7 6 Cartman "Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
"
7 6 Cartman "No sign of forced entry.
"
7 6 Cartman "We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
"
7 6 Cartman "Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
"
7 6 Cartman "Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
"
7 6 Cartman "You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
"
7 6 Cartman "You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
"
7 6 Cartman "Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
"
7 6 Cartman "You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
"
7 6 Cartman "Stop playing games!
"
7 6 Cartman "That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
"
7 6 Cartman "I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
"
7 6 Cartman "Really?
"
7 6 Cartman "Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Follow me to the bathroom. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
"
7 6 Cartman "Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well pull harder!
"
7 6 Cartman "Try doin' it faster
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
"
7 6 Cartman "The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
"
7 6 Cartman "Let's go! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kyle! 
"
7 6 Cartman "I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 6 Cartman "Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
"
7 6 Cartman "Yeah! This was our hot lead!
"
7 6 Cartman "Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
"
7 6 Cartman "All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
"
7 6 Cartman "We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
"
7 6 Cartman "Kewl!
"
7 6 Cartman "Uh bonus?
"
7 6 Cartman "Me neither.
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
"
7 6 Cartman "Awwwwrrr-auugh. 
"
7 6 Cartman "We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
"
7 6 Cartman "Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
"
7 6 Cartman "Okay. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters?
"
7 6 Cartman "Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, keep tryin', Butters.
"
7 6 Cartman "A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
"
7 6 Cartman "Un oh...
"
7 6 Cartman "Bang bang bang... 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" 
"
7 6 Cartman "Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
"
7 6 Cartman "You did?
"
7 6 Cartman "Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
"
7 7 Cartman "Man, Indians have it good, huh?
"
7 7 Cartman "All right, let's go! 
"
7 7 Cartman "I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
"
7 7 Cartman "Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
"
7 7 Cartman "Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
"
7 7 Cartman "That's right!
"
7 7 Cartman "Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
"
7 7 Cartman "Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
7 7 Cartman "Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
"
7 7 Cartman "You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
"
7 8 Cartman "What? Tell us?
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
"
7 8 Cartman "What a dork!
"
7 8 Cartman "Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
"
7 8 Cartman "We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
"
7 8 Cartman "GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
"
7 8 Cartman "You're straight like a freeway!
"
7 8 Cartman "You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
"
7 8 Cartman "...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
7 8 Cartman "I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
"
7 8 Cartman "Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
"
7 8 Cartman "Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
"
7 8 Cartman "You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
7 8 Cartman "He's not our friend. 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
"
7 9 Cartman "God dammit! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
"
7 9 Cartman "Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
"
7 9 Cartman "Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
"
7 9 Cartman "It worked for Creed!
"
7 9 Cartman "You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
"
7 9 Cartman "Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
"
7 9 Cartman "I told you, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
"
7 9 Cartman "We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
"
7 9 Cartman "Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
"
7 9 Cartman "Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
"
7 9 Cartman "All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
"
7 9 Cartman "Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
"
7 9 Cartman "All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
"
7 9 Cartman "Almost there, you guys.
"
7 9 Cartman "Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
"
7 9 Cartman "I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
7 9 Cartman "No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
7 9 Cartman "So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh hey guys. How's it going?
"
7 9 Cartman "I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
7 9 Cartman "That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
"
7 9 Cartman "It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
"
7 9 Cartman "I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
"
7 9 Cartman "I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
"
7 9 Cartman "Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who are you?
"
7 9 Cartman "Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
"
7 9 Cartman "Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
"
7 9 Cartman "Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
"
7 9 Cartman "You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, we sure do.
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
"
7 9 Cartman "I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
"
7 9 Cartman "The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
"
7 9 Cartman "Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
7 9 Cartman "Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
"
7 9 Cartman "We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
"
7 9 Cartman "You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
"
7 9 Cartman "GOD DAMMIT!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
"
7 9 Cartman "OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
"
7 10 Cartman "With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
"
7 10 Cartman "I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
"
7 10 Cartman "Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
"
7 10 Cartman "Calm down! We cannot understand you!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, they're coming! 
"
7 10 Cartman "They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
"
7 10 Cartman "Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
"
7 10 Cartman "My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
7 10 Cartman "I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
7 10 Cartman "More old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people gone mad!
"
7 10 Cartman "So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
7 10 Cartman "No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
7 10 Cartman "Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
7 10 Cartman "I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Aw yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
7 11 Cartman "Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's joking? 
"
7 11 Cartman "You have AIDS?
"
7 11 Cartman "Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
7 11 Cartman "This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
7 11 Cartman "Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
7 11 Cartman "I have never been a dick to you.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hi Kyle. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What isn't it?
"
7 11 Cartman "...I don't understand the difference.
"
7 11 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Like what?
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's there?
"
7 11 Cartman "Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
7 11 Cartman "Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hey Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well what?
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
7 11 Cartman "So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
7 11 Cartman "I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
7 11 Cartman "Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
7 11 Cartman "For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
7 11 Cartman "A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
7 11 Cartman "According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
7 11 Cartman "Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
7 11 Cartman "Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
7 11 Cartman "Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
7 11 Cartman "Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
7 11 Cartman "The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
7 11 Cartman "There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
"
7 11 Cartman "No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
7 11 Cartman "We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
7 11 Cartman "Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What what what?
"
7 11 Cartman "UUuuugh!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
7 11 Cartman "They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
7 11 Cartman "We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
7 11 Cartman "Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
7 11 Cartman "We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
7 11 Cartman "It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
7 11 Cartman "We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
7 11 Cartman "Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
7 11 Cartman "We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
7 11 Cartman "I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
7 11 Cartman "We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"
7 11 Cartman """Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
"
7 11 Cartman "What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday to you. Happy- 
"
7 11 Cartman "We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
7 11 Cartman "But... Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Cartman "But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
7 11 Cartman "I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!
"
7 11 Cartman "Totally. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
"
7 12 Cartman "Go kick his ass, Stan.
"
7 12 Cartman "Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
"
7 12 Cartman "They're just standing there, talking. 
"
7 12 Cartman "You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
"
7 12 Cartman "Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
7 12 Cartman "Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
"
7 12 Cartman "Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
7 12 Cartman "Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
7 12 Cartman "Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm going to kill myself. 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothing.
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Gross dude! 
"
7 13 Cartman "No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
7 13 Cartman "We're sorry.
"
7 13 Cartman "Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
7 13 Cartman "Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
"
7 13 Cartman "Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
7 13 Cartman "Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
7 13 Cartman "Got it! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
7 13 Cartman "Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
7 13 Cartman "Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow, a commercial?
"
7 13 Cartman "God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
7 13 Cartman "So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
7 13 Cartman "Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
7 13 Cartman "Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
7 13 Cartman "Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, ho-okay. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
7 13 Cartman "Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
7 13 Cartman "They're going to kill me! 
"
7 13 Cartman "The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys have to help me!
"
7 13 Cartman "Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
"
7 13 Cartman "If I go, you guys go!
"
7 13 Cartman "Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
7 13 Cartman "I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Aw awww!
"
7 14 Cartman "Right. What are we playing again?
"
7 14 Cartman "Got it. 
"
7 14 Cartman "What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
"
7 14 Cartman "Yeh-heah, right!
"
7 14 Cartman "What a whore! 
"
7 14 Cartman "Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
7 14 Cartman "God, what a fag!
"
7 14 Cartman "How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
"
7 14 Cartman "Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
7 14 Cartman "Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
7 15 Cartman "Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
7 15 Cartman "We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
7 15 Cartman "Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
7 15 Cartman "HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "What?
"
7 15 Cartman "No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
7 15 Cartman "You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
7 15 Cartman "Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
7 15 Cartman "It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
"
7 15 Cartman "This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
7 15 Cartman "You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
7 15 Cartman "Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
7 15 Cartman "We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
7 15 Cartman "You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
7 15 Cartman "Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
7 15 Cartman "Sweet.
"
7 15 Cartman "Look out!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus Christ.
"
7 15 Cartman "Which road?!
"
7 15 Cartman "Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
7 15 Cartman "But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
7 15 Cartman "How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
"
7 15 Cartman "How could you be so stupid!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
"
7 15 Cartman "We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
"
7 15 Cartman "Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
7 15 Cartman "And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
"
7 15 Cartman "It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
"
7 15 Cartman "Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
7 1 Cartman "Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
"
7 1 Cartman "What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
"
7 1 Cartman "No I don't remember that!
"
7 1 Cartman "No, because the aliens erased my memory!
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw dude, I hate repeats!
"
7 1 Cartman "SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
"
7 1 Cartman "What?
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha, very funny.
"
7 1 Cartman "Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
7 1 Cartman "Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
"
7 1 Cartman "Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
"
7 1 Cartman "Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
"
7 1 Cartman "You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
"
7 1 Cartman "Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Nope! It has to be Kyle!
"
7 1 Cartman "Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
"
7 1 Cartman "I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay. Okay okay. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
"
7 1 Cartman "Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
7 1 Cartman "All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
7 1 Cartman "No, go ahead. I'm dry.
"
7 1 Cartman "But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
"
7 1 Cartman "Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
"
7 1 Cartman "This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
7 1 Cartman "It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
"
7 1 Cartman "What are you doing, man?! 
"
7 1 Cartman "When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
"
7 1 Cartman "Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
7 1 Cartman "...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
"
7 1 Cartman "This is like my fifth time. 
"
7 1 Cartman "Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
"
7 1 Cartman "Santa!
"
7 1 Cartman "Oooo, very nice.
"
7 1 Cartman "How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
"
7 1 Cartman "Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
"
7 1 Cartman "Tell us about it!
"
7 1 Cartman "No.
"
7 1 Cartman "There's even World War Three to look forward to.
"
7 1 Cartman "Uuugh.
"
7 1 Cartman "That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7 1 Cartman "What is it, Chef?
"
7 2 Cartman "We didn't go to your comedy show.
"
7 2 Cartman "Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
"
7 2 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
"
7 2 Cartman "Can too!
"
7 2 Cartman "Oh God-damnit!!
"
7 2 Cartman "But they say I can't be in their club!!
"
7 3 Cartman "Put more clay on the balls.
"
7 3 Cartman "What a crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "You can't do that!
"
7 3 Cartman "You're an art teacher!
"
7 3 Cartman "We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
"
7 3 Cartman "Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
"
7 3 Cartman "Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
7 3 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
"
7 3 Cartman "Should be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yep. All set.
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
"
7 3 Cartman "Heh yeah, that that's right.
"
7 3 Cartman "No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
"
7 3 Cartman "It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
"
7 3 Cartman "So?
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, let's go! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
"
7 3 Cartman "Who cares??
"
7 3 Cartman "Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
"
7 3 Cartman "Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Damn!
"
7 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
"
7 3 Cartman "Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
"
7 3 Cartman "Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
7 3 Cartman "Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
"
7 3 Cartman "Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
"
7 3 Cartman "They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
"
7 3 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
"
7 3 Cartman "No need. I have one for you right here. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Is there anything else I can get for you?
"
7 3 Cartman "You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
"
7 3 Cartman "Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
"
7 3 Cartman "Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
"
7 3 Cartman "We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
"
7 3 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 3 Cartman "He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
"
7 3 Cartman "I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
"
7 3 Cartman "Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "And you feel like you have to confess.
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
"
7 3 Cartman "Won't be long, Kyle. 
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
"
7 3 Cartman "They did?
"
7 3 Cartman "But can I still kill Kyyyle?
"
7 3 Cartman "Uh, can we see them-him-her?
"
7 3 Cartman "What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
"
7 3 Cartman "Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
"
7 3 Cartman "You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
"
7 3 Cartman "What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
"
7 3 Cartman "Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
"
7 3 Cartman "So... so then, how can you feel bad?
"
7 3 Cartman "...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
"
7 3 Cartman "What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
"
7 3 Cartman "For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
7 3 Cartman "Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
"
7 3 Cartman "Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
"
7 3 Cartman "It's over this way! Come on!
"
7 3 Cartman "So how are things, guys?
"
7 3 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
"
7 3 Cartman "Can't I? 
"
7 3 Cartman "Hi guys.
"
7 3 Cartman "I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
"
7 3 Cartman "My consciences just caught up with me.
"
7 3 Cartman "I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
"
7 3 Cartman "I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
7 3 Cartman "Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
"
7 3 Cartman "Hm.
"
7 4 Cartman "Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
"
7 4 Cartman "Bush is a Naizi
"
7 4 Cartman "...Eh the... Founding who? 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. M-maaaa.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
"
7 4 Cartman "I'm trying to have a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
"
7 4 Cartman "Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
"
7 4 Cartman "Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
"
7 4 Cartman "That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Benjamin Franklin?
"
7 4 Cartman "Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
"
7 4 Cartman "Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
"
7 4 Cartman "I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
"
7 4 Cartman "Or a really sweet one. 
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, here it goes! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Ohhh awesome!!! 
"
7 4 Cartman "Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
7 4 Cartman "Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
"
7 4 Cartman "No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
"
7 4 Cartman "Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
7 4 Cartman "Super neato! 
"
7 4 Cartman "But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
"
7 4 Cartman "And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
7 4 Cartman "It's a bitch, ain't it?
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow.
"
7 4 Cartman "Whoa, how very very relevant.
"
7 4 Cartman "Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
"
7 4 Cartman "Wow!
"
7 4 Cartman "Everyone, stop! Please! 
"
7 4 Cartman "If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
"
7 4 Cartman "I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""
"
7 4 Cartman "The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
"
7 5 Cartman "Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Miss Lopez, come on out here. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, you mean this one? 
"
7 5 Cartman "There we go, Saright?
"
7 5 Cartman "That's a very pretty dress. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez
"
7 5 Cartman "Nono, Jeh-

7 5 Cartman "Jeh-

7 5 Cartman "Jeh
"
7 5 Cartman "Jennifer Lopez
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
"
7 5 Cartman "And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
"
7 5 Cartman "Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
7 5 Cartman "Is nice?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
"
7 5 Cartman "I agree. Those places are stupid.
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
"
7 5 Cartman "Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
"
7 5 Cartman "All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Yeah, I wanna leave.
"
7 5 Cartman "What?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 
"
7 5 Cartman "What do they want?
"
7 5 Cartman "S'awright?
"
7 5 Cartman "What? What?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hello hello, are you still there?
"
7 5 Cartman "You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
"
7 5 Cartman "Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
"
7 5 Cartman "Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
"
7 5 Cartman "There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.
"
7 5 Cartman "Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
"
7 5 Cartman "Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
"
7 5 Cartman "Jennifer Lopez?
"
7 5 Cartman "Not me!
"
7 5 Cartman "I'm sure it was just a mistake.
"
7 5 Cartman "Shut your God-damned mouth!
"
7 5 Cartman "Nobody
"
7 5 Cartman "Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
"
7 5 Cartman "I will
"
7 5 Cartman "Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
"
7 5 Cartman "Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "What the hell are you doing?
"
7 5 Cartman "Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Moooommm!
"
7 5 Cartman "Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
"
7 5 Cartman "Heyesss.
"
7 5 Cartman "She's not here right now.
"
7 5 Cartman "NO!
"
7 5 Cartman "I'm not going out in his car.
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
"
7 5 Cartman "NO!
"
7 5 Cartman "Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude!
"
7 5 Cartman "OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
"
7 5 Cartman "Aww crap.
"
7 5 Cartman "OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
"
7 5 Cartman "I told you this would happen. 
"
7 5 Cartman "Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
"
7 5 Cartman "EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! 
"
7 5 Cartman "Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
"
7 5 Cartman "You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
"
7 5 Cartman "What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!
"
7 5 Cartman "What news?
"
7 5 Cartman "S'aright.
"
7 5 Cartman "Oh, balls!
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
7 5 Cartman "I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Stop doing what?
"
7 5 Cartman "Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
7 5 Cartman "Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
"
7 5 Cartman "Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
"
7 5 Cartman "Guys... Uh... Uh... 
"
7 5 Cartman "I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
"
7 5 Cartman "Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
"
7 6 Cartman "Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
"
7 6 Cartman "Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
7 6 Cartman "My God...
"
7 6 Cartman "What have you got, Marsh?
"
7 6 Cartman "Jesus, we're too late.
"
7 6 Cartman "Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
"
7 6 Cartman "Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
7 6 Cartman "The torso he would dump into the lake. 
"
7 6 Cartman "And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
"
7 6 Cartman "Looks like the game is over, old man! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
"
7 6 Cartman "Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
"
7 6 Cartman "Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
"
7 6 Cartman "No sign of forced entry.
"
7 6 Cartman "We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
"
7 6 Cartman "Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
"
7 6 Cartman "Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
"
7 6 Cartman "You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
"
7 6 Cartman "You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
"
7 6 Cartman "Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
"
7 6 Cartman "You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
"
7 6 Cartman "Stop playing games!
"
7 6 Cartman "That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
"
7 6 Cartman "I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
"
7 6 Cartman "Really?
"
7 6 Cartman "Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Follow me to the bathroom. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
"
7 6 Cartman "Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well pull harder!
"
7 6 Cartman "Try doin' it faster
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
"
7 6 Cartman "The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
"
7 6 Cartman "Let's go! 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kyle! 
"
7 6 Cartman "I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
"
7 6 Cartman "Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Why not?
"
7 6 Cartman "Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
"
7 6 Cartman "Yeah! This was our hot lead!
"
7 6 Cartman "Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
"
7 6 Cartman "All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
"
7 6 Cartman "We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
"
7 6 Cartman "Kewl!
"
7 6 Cartman "Uh bonus?
"
7 6 Cartman "Me neither.
"
7 6 Cartman "Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
"
7 6 Cartman "Awwwwrrr-auugh. 
"
7 6 Cartman "We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
"
7 6 Cartman "Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
"
7 6 Cartman "Okay. 
"
7 6 Cartman "Butters?
"
7 6 Cartman "Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"
7 6 Cartman "Well, keep tryin', Butters.
"
7 6 Cartman "A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
"
7 6 Cartman "Un oh...
"
7 6 Cartman "Bang bang bang... 
"
7 6 Cartman "Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" 
"
7 6 Cartman "Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
"
7 6 Cartman "You did?
"
7 6 Cartman "Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
"
7 7 Cartman "Man, Indians have it good, huh?
"
7 7 Cartman "All right, let's go! 
"
7 7 Cartman "I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
"
7 7 Cartman "Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
"
7 7 Cartman "Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
"
7 7 Cartman "That's right!
"
7 7 Cartman "Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
"
7 7 Cartman "Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
7 7 Cartman "Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
"
7 7 Cartman "You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
"
7 8 Cartman "What? Tell us?
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
"
7 8 Cartman "What a dork!
"
7 8 Cartman "Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
"
7 8 Cartman "We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
"
7 8 Cartman "GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
"
7 8 Cartman "You're straight like a freeway!
"
7 8 Cartman "You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
"
7 8 Cartman "...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
7 8 Cartman "I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
"
7 8 Cartman "Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
"
7 8 Cartman "Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
"
7 8 Cartman "Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
"
7 8 Cartman "You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
7 8 Cartman "He's not our friend. 
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
"
7 8 Cartman "That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
"
7 8 Cartman "Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
"
7 9 Cartman "God dammit! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
"
7 9 Cartman "Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
"
7 9 Cartman "Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
"
7 9 Cartman "It worked for Creed!
"
7 9 Cartman "You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
"
7 9 Cartman "Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
"
7 9 Cartman "I told you, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
"
7 9 Cartman "We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
"
7 9 Cartman "Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
"
7 9 Cartman "Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
"
7 9 Cartman "All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
"
7 9 Cartman "Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
"
7 9 Cartman "All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
"
7 9 Cartman "Almost there, you guys.
"
7 9 Cartman "Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
"
7 9 Cartman "I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
"
7 9 Cartman "Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
7 9 Cartman "No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
"
7 9 Cartman "No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
"
7 9 Cartman "Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
7 9 Cartman "So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh hey guys. How's it going?
"
7 9 Cartman "I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
7 9 Cartman "That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
"
7 9 Cartman "It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
"
7 9 Cartman "I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
"
7 9 Cartman "I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
"
7 9 Cartman "Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
"
7 9 Cartman "Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who are you?
"
7 9 Cartman "Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
"
7 9 Cartman "Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
"
7 9 Cartman "Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
"
7 9 Cartman "You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, we sure do.
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
"
7 9 Cartman "Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
"
7 9 Cartman "I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
"
7 9 Cartman "The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
"
7 9 Cartman "Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
7 9 Cartman "Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
"
7 9 Cartman "We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
"
7 9 Cartman "Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
7 9 Cartman "Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
"
7 9 Cartman "Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
"
7 9 Cartman "You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
"
7 9 Cartman "GOD DAMMIT!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
"
7 9 Cartman "OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
"
7 9 Cartman "Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
"
7 10 Cartman "With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
"
7 10 Cartman "I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
"
7 10 Cartman "Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
"
7 10 Cartman "Calm down! We cannot understand you!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Oh God, they're coming! 
"
7 10 Cartman "They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
"
7 10 Cartman "Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
"
7 10 Cartman "My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
7 10 Cartman "I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
7 10 Cartman "More old people!
"
7 10 Cartman "Old people gone mad!
"
7 10 Cartman "So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
7 10 Cartman "No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
7 10 Cartman "Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
7 10 Cartman "I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
7 10 Cartman "Yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Aw yeah!
"
7 10 Cartman "Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
7 11 Cartman "Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's joking? 
"
7 11 Cartman "You have AIDS?
"
7 11 Cartman "Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
7 11 Cartman "This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
7 11 Cartman "Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
7 11 Cartman "I have never been a dick to you.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
7 11 Cartman "Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hi Kyle. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What isn't it?
"
7 11 Cartman "...I don't understand the difference.
"
7 11 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
7 11 Cartman "Like what?
"
7 11 Cartman "Who's there?
"
7 11 Cartman "Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
7 11 Cartman "Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
7 11 Cartman "Hey Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well what?
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
7 11 Cartman "So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
7 11 Cartman "I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
7 11 Cartman "Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
7 11 Cartman "For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
7 11 Cartman "A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
7 11 Cartman "According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
7 11 Cartman "Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
7 11 Cartman "No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
7 11 Cartman "I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
7 11 Cartman "Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
7 11 Cartman "Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes?
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
7 11 Cartman "Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
7 11 Cartman "Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
"
7 11 Cartman "Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
7 11 Cartman "Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
7 11 Cartman "Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters!
"
7 11 Cartman "Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
7 11 Cartman "The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
7 11 Cartman "There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
"
7 11 Cartman "No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
7 11 Cartman "We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
7 11 Cartman "Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
7 11 Cartman "What what what?
"
7 11 Cartman "UUuuugh!! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
7 11 Cartman "They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
7 11 Cartman "We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
7 11 Cartman "Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
7 11 Cartman "Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
7 11 Cartman "All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
7 11 Cartman "Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
7 11 Cartman "We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
"
7 11 Cartman "Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
7 11 Cartman "It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
7 11 Cartman "We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
7 11 Cartman "Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
"
7 11 Cartman "Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
"
7 11 Cartman "The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
7 11 Cartman "We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
7 11 Cartman "Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
7 11 Cartman "I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
7 11 Cartman "We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"
7 11 Cartman """Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
"
7 11 Cartman "What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
"
7 11 Cartman "Happy Birthday to you. Happy- 
"
7 11 Cartman "We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
7 11 Cartman "But... Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Cartman "But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
7 11 Cartman "I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
"
7 11 Cartman "Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
"
7 11 Cartman "Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me!

7 11 Cartman "Totally.

7 12 Cartman "Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
"
7 12 Cartman "Go kick his ass, Stan.
"
7 12 Cartman "Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
"
7 12 Cartman "Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
"
7 12 Cartman "They're just standing there, talking. 
"
7 12 Cartman "You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
"
7 12 Cartman "Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
7 12 Cartman "Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
"
7 12 Cartman "Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
7 12 Cartman "Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
"
7 12 Cartman "Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
7 12 Cartman "Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
7 12 Cartman "Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm going to kill myself. 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothing.
"
7 13 Cartman "Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Gross dude! 
"
7 13 Cartman "No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
7 13 Cartman "We're sorry.
"
7 13 Cartman "Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
7 13 Cartman "Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
"
7 13 Cartman "Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
7 13 Cartman "Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
7 13 Cartman "Got it! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
7 13 Cartman "Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
7 13 Cartman "Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
7 13 Cartman "Wow, a commercial?
"
7 13 Cartman "God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
7 13 Cartman "So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
7 13 Cartman "Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
7 13 Cartman "Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
7 13 Cartman "Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
7 13 Cartman "Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, ho-okay. 
"
7 13 Cartman "Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
7 13 Cartman "Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
7 13 Cartman "I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
7 13 Cartman "Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
7 13 Cartman "They're going to kill me! 
"
7 13 Cartman "The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys have to help me!
"
7 13 Cartman "Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
"
7 13 Cartman "If I go, you guys go!
"
7 13 Cartman "Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
7 13 Cartman "You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
7 13 Cartman "I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
7 13 Cartman "Aw awww!
"
7 14 Cartman "Right. What are we playing again?
"
7 14 Cartman "Got it. 
"
7 14 Cartman "What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
"
7 14 Cartman "Yeh-heah, right!
"
7 14 Cartman "What a whore! 
"
7 14 Cartman "Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
7 14 Cartman "God, what a fag!
"
7 14 Cartman "How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
"
7 14 Cartman "Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
7 14 Cartman "Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
7 15 Cartman "Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
7 15 Cartman "We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
7 15 Cartman "Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
7 15 Cartman "HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
7 15 Cartman "What?
"
7 15 Cartman "No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
7 15 Cartman "You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
7 15 Cartman "Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
7 15 Cartman "It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
"
7 15 Cartman "This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
7 15 Cartman "You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
7 15 Cartman "Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
7 15 Cartman "We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
7 15 Cartman "You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
7 15 Cartman "Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
7 15 Cartman "Sweet.
"
7 15 Cartman "Look out!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus Christ.
"
7 15 Cartman "Which road?!
"
7 15 Cartman "Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
7 15 Cartman "But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
7 15 Cartman "How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
"
7 15 Cartman "How could you be so stupid!
"
7 15 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
"
7 15 Cartman "We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
"
7 15 Cartman "Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
7 15 Cartman "And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
"
7 15 Cartman "I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
"
7 15 Cartman "It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
"
7 15 Cartman "Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
"
7 15 Cartman "Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
"
