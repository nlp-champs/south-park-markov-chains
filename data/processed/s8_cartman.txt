8 1 Cartman "Pfaha, so funny. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
"
8 1 Cartman "Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
"
8 1 Cartman "I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
8 1 Cartman "Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
"
8 1 Cartman "Kick ass! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Look what we got.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ugh.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
"
8 1 Cartman "I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
8 1 Cartman "I have the power to have all the powers I want.
"
8 1 Cartman "C'mon!
"
8 1 Cartman "Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
"
8 1 Cartman "That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh, shit, dude!
"
8 1 Cartman "Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
"
8 1 Cartman "Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
"
8 1 Cartman "Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Dr. Shafley?
"
8 1 Cartman "So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
"
8 1 Cartman "Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
"
8 1 Cartman "In here! 
"
8 1 Cartman "No way, you got weapons too?!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
"
8 1 Cartman "Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
"
8 1 Cartman "Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
"
8 1 Cartman "All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
"
8 1 Cartman "What?
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
"
8 2 Cartman "The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
"
8 2 Cartman "What?
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
"
8 2 Cartman "What? What'd I do?
"
8 2 Cartman "You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
8 2 Cartman "So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
"
8 2 Cartman "It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
"
8 2 Cartman "Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Why?
"
8 2 Cartman "What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
"
8 2 Cartman "Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
"
8 2 Cartman "You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
"
8 2 Cartman "What?! 
"
8 2 Cartman "Moooommmm?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, could I get you to do something for me?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
"
8 2 Cartman "I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
"
8 2 Cartman "...I'll split the money with you. 
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
"
8 2 Cartman "Awesome.
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Enter. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Go on, Kyle.
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
8 2 Cartman "Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
"
8 2 Cartman "Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
"
8 2 Cartman "One thousand dollars, yeah!
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
8 2 Cartman "Whoa. What the hell?? 
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "Ah, screw you hippies!
"
8 2 Cartman "...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
"
8 2 Cartman "Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
8 2 Cartman "Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
"
8 3 Cartman "What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
"
8 3 Cartman "It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
8 3 Cartman "Set phasers on stun.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes. A little too quiet.
"
8 3 Cartman "Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
"
8 3 Cartman "Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
8 3 Cartman "How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
"
8 3 Cartman "Go see the movie, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
"
8 3 Cartman "Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
"
8 3 Cartman "Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Doorbell!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Answer the door!
"
8 3 Cartman "God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 
"
8 3 Cartman "It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
"
8 3 Cartman "Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
"
8 3 Cartman "I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
"
8 3 Cartman "Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
"
8 3 Cartman "What?
"
8 3 Cartman "You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
"
8 3 Cartman "If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
"
8 3 Cartman "Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
"
8 3 Cartman "I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
"
8 3 Cartman "Eup. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
8 3 Cartman "Tell them I'll be down shortly
"
8 3 Cartman "Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
"
8 3 Cartman "But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
"
8 3 Cartman "One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
"
8 3 Cartman "And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""
"
8 3 Cartman "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Nice.
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Juden!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
"
8 4 Cartman "Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
"
8 4 Cartman "Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
8 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right, Butters! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
"
8 5 Cartman "I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. I will be your new best friend.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
"
8 5 Cartman "That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Heh. Wow, that sucks.
"
8 5 Cartman "Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "You saw that?
"
8 5 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
8 5 Cartman "No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
"
8 5 Cartman "Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
"
8 5 Cartman "Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
"
8 5 Cartman "...No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
"
8 5 Cartman "Where is it? Where is it?!
"
8 5 Cartman "Wah!
"
8 5 Cartman "Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O understands.
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like some Sunny Delight too.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
"
8 5 Cartman "Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
8 5 Cartman "Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
"
8 5 Cartman "Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes, of course. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
"
8 5 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Argh! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
"
8 5 Cartman "The New Orleans Saints. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Seventeen. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
"
8 5 Cartman "Haaaa! Haaaa!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
8 5 Cartman "Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
"
8 5 Cartman "...What?
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not understand.
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Waaaaa! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
"
8 5 Cartman "Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
"
8 5 Cartman "The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
"
8 5 Cartman "I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
"
8 5 Cartman "Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
8 5 Cartman "No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh... now ending fart sequence.
"
8 5 Cartman "Smell sequence initiated.
"
8 5 Cartman "Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame...
"
8 6 Cartman "I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
"
8 6 Cartman "No.
"
8 6 Cartman "Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
"
8 6 Cartman "They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
"
8 6 Cartman "They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train! Yay! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
"
8 6 Cartman "Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
"
8 6 Cartman "...Train together
"
8 6 Cartman "...I've got time. Do youuu??
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
8 6 Cartman "You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
"
8 6 Cartman "What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
8 6 Cartman "You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
"
8 6 Cartman "He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
"
8 6 Cartman "Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
8 6 Cartman "Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
"
8 6 Cartman "No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
"
8 6 Cartman "Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
"
8 7 Cartman "Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
"
8 7 Cartman "Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
"
8 7 Cartman "It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
"
8 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm takin' a break.
"
8 7 Cartman "Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
"
8 7 Cartman "It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
"
8 7 Cartman "Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
"
8 7 Cartman "Shoveling accident.
"
8 7 Cartman "You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
"
8 7 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
8 7 Cartman "We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Look, it's working! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
"
8 8 Cartman "Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Ye-heah!
"
8 8 Cartman "Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""
"
8 8 Cartman "Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
"
8 8 Cartman "It is not!
"
8 8 Cartman "Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
"
8 8 Cartman "...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
"
8 8 Cartman "It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
"
8 8 Cartman "A turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Awwwww!
"
8 8 Cartman "Okay. You win, Kyle.
"
8 8 Cartman "All right turd sandwich!
"
8 8 Cartman "Giant Douche sucks!
"
8 8 Cartman "Game on, Jew-boy!
"
8 8 Cartman "Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
"
8 8 Cartman "Hello, Clyde.
"
8 8 Cartman "We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
"
8 8 Cartman "Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
"
8 8 Cartman "You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
"
8 8 Cartman "So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
"
8 8 Cartman "Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
"
8 8 Cartman "Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
"
8 8 Cartman "Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh, no! Noooo!!
"
8 9 Cartman "You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
"
8 9 Cartman "Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, awesome!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
"
8 9 Cartman "What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "What? That's called progress, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
"
8 9 Cartman "No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh, awesome! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"
8 9 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
8 9 Cartman "I am not, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
"
8 9 Cartman "You heard what?
"
8 9 Cartman "That's not what I said! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
"
8 9 Cartman "I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
8 9 Cartman "Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
"
8 9 Cartman "You speak too much, sir!
"
8 9 Cartman "That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
"
8 9 Cartman "I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
"
8 9 Cartman "I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
"
8 10 Cartman "Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
"
8 10 Cartman "It's true.
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
"
8 10 Cartman "Jews can't be firemen.
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
8 10 Cartman "But how do we start a fire?
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't worry, Trent.
"
8 10 Cartman "Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever. That's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
"
8 10 Cartman "We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
8 10 Cartman "How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
8 10 Cartman "I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
"
8 10 Cartman "Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman """But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman "Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
"
8 10 Cartman "All right!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A picture of your mom's boobs?
"
8 10 Cartman "A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
8 10 Cartman "Aaaaaaaah!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Stay away from us, Trent!
"
8 10 Cartman "It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
8 10 Cartman "I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever, that's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
"
8 10 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hah! Hey!
"
8 11 Cartman "And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
8 11 Cartman "Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
"
8 11 Cartman "...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
"
8 11 Cartman "Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
"
8 11 Cartman "How many students is that?
"
8 11 Cartman "What is that butthole doing now?!
"
8 11 Cartman "Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
"
8 11 Cartman "...You're gay!
"
8 11 Cartman "Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
"
8 11 Cartman "God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
"
8 11 Cartman "Go play with yourself, Craig.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
"
8 11 Cartman "You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
8 11 Cartman "It should be Sexy News.
"
8 11 Cartman "Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
"
8 11 Cartman "Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
8 11 Cartman "And panda bears for the preschoolers.
"
8 11 Cartman "We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
"
8 11 Cartman "Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
8 11 Cartman "You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
"
8 11 Cartman "Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
"
8 11 Cartman "One testicle!  What an asshole! 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
"
8 11 Cartman "It's boring news, Jimmy.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, tell me about it.
"
8 11 Cartman "Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
8 11 Cartman "I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we have us, um... hmmm.
"
8 11 Cartman "Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
"
8 11 Cartman "They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
"
8 11 Cartman "Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
"
8 11 Cartman "We have crab people. Just sayin'.
"
8 11 Cartman "That sounds perfect.
"
8 11 Cartman "Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan, are you getting good ideas?
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh dude, I just got the best idea
"
8 11 Cartman "Dude, this TV show is awesome.
"
8 11 Cartman "I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
"
8 11 Cartman "They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
8 11 Cartman "Haha! In your face, Craig!
"
8 11 Cartman "This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
"
8 11 Cartman "...I think bail.
"
8 12 Cartman """Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
"
8 12 Cartman "Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, Goddammit!
"
8 13 Cartman "This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
"
8 13 Cartman "...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm gonna!
"
8 13 Cartman "Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
"
8 13 Cartman "Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
"
8 13 Cartman "And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Eugh... 
"
8 13 Cartman "Wheh? Where am I?
"
8 13 Cartman "Coma... How long?
"
8 13 Cartman "Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
"
8 13 Cartman "Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
"
8 13 Cartman "Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
"
8 13 Cartman "Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
"
8 13 Cartman "How come the outline is missing its hand?
"
8 13 Cartman "Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
"
8 13 Cartman "Guess again.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wow!
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
"
8 13 Cartman "Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
"
8 13 Cartman "Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
"
8 13 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
"
8 13 Cartman "What?
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
"
8 13 Cartman "No. Nothing.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
"
8 13 Cartman "It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
8 13 Cartman "If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
"
8 13 Cartman "More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
"
8 13 Cartman "Proper channels?
"
8 13 Cartman "I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
"
8 13 Cartman "Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
"
8 13 Cartman "Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
"
8 13 Cartman "In court?
"
8 13 Cartman "Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
8 13 Cartman "... 'Kay. Sweet.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
"
8 13 Cartman "Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't even know you dude!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, Jesus.
"
8 13 Cartman "No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
"
8 13 Cartman "Heheh.
"
8 13 Cartman "Yes yes, I see! 
"
8 13 Cartman "AAAAAAAH!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Come over here!)
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Help!) 
"
8 13 Cartman "No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
"
8 13 Cartman "Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
"
8 13 Cartman "You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
"
8 13 Cartman "You can't hurt me.
"
8 14 Cartman "I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
"
8 14 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
"
8 14 Cartman "All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
8 14 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
"
8 14 Cartman "That's not at all what happens.
"
8 14 Cartman """Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8 1 Cartman "Pfaha, so funny. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
"
8 1 Cartman "Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
"
8 1 Cartman "I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
8 1 Cartman "Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
"
8 1 Cartman "Kick ass! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Look what we got.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ugh.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
"
8 1 Cartman "I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
8 1 Cartman "I have the power to have all the powers I want.
"
8 1 Cartman "C'mon!
"
8 1 Cartman "Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
"
8 1 Cartman "That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh, shit, dude!
"
8 1 Cartman "Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
"
8 1 Cartman "Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
"
8 1 Cartman "Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Dr. Shafley?
"
8 1 Cartman "So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
"
8 1 Cartman "Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
"
8 1 Cartman "In here! 
"
8 1 Cartman "No way, you got weapons too?!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
"
8 1 Cartman "Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
"
8 1 Cartman "Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
"
8 1 Cartman "All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
"
8 1 Cartman "What?
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
"
8 2 Cartman "The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
"
8 2 Cartman "What?
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
"
8 2 Cartman "What? What'd I do?
"
8 2 Cartman "You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
8 2 Cartman "So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
"
8 2 Cartman "It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
"
8 2 Cartman "Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Why?
"
8 2 Cartman "What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
"
8 2 Cartman "Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
"
8 2 Cartman "You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
"
8 2 Cartman "What?! 
"
8 2 Cartman "Moooommmm?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, could I get you to do something for me?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
"
8 2 Cartman "I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
"
8 2 Cartman "...I'll split the money with you. 
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
"
8 2 Cartman "Awesome.
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Enter. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Go on, Kyle.
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
8 2 Cartman "Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
"
8 2 Cartman "Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
"
8 2 Cartman "One thousand dollars, yeah!
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
8 2 Cartman "Whoa. What the hell?? 
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "Ah, screw you hippies!
"
8 2 Cartman "...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
"
8 2 Cartman "Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
8 2 Cartman "Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
"
8 3 Cartman "What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
"
8 3 Cartman "It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
8 3 Cartman "Set phasers on stun.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes. A little too quiet.
"
8 3 Cartman "Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
"
8 3 Cartman "Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
8 3 Cartman "How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
"
8 3 Cartman "Go see the movie, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
"
8 3 Cartman "Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
"
8 3 Cartman "Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Doorbell!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Answer the door!
"
8 3 Cartman "God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 
"
8 3 Cartman "It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
"
8 3 Cartman "Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
"
8 3 Cartman "I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
"
8 3 Cartman "Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
"
8 3 Cartman "What?
"
8 3 Cartman "You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
"
8 3 Cartman "If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
"
8 3 Cartman "Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
"
8 3 Cartman "I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
"
8 3 Cartman "Eup. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
8 3 Cartman "Tell them I'll be down shortly
"
8 3 Cartman "Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
"
8 3 Cartman "But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
"
8 3 Cartman "One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
"
8 3 Cartman "And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""
"
8 3 Cartman "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Nice.
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Juden!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
"
8 4 Cartman "Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
"
8 4 Cartman "Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
8 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right, Butters! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
"
8 5 Cartman "I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. I will be your new best friend.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
"
8 5 Cartman "That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Heh. Wow, that sucks.
"
8 5 Cartman "Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "You saw that?
"
8 5 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
8 5 Cartman "No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
"
8 5 Cartman "Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
"
8 5 Cartman "Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
"
8 5 Cartman "...No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
"
8 5 Cartman "Where is it? Where is it?!
"
8 5 Cartman "Wah!
"
8 5 Cartman "Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O understands.
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like some Sunny Delight too.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
"
8 5 Cartman "Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
8 5 Cartman "Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
"
8 5 Cartman "Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes, of course. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
"
8 5 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Argh! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
"
8 5 Cartman "The New Orleans Saints. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Seventeen. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
"
8 5 Cartman "Haaaa! Haaaa!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
8 5 Cartman "Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
"
8 5 Cartman "...What?
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not understand.
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Waaaaa! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
"
8 5 Cartman "Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
"
8 5 Cartman "The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
"
8 5 Cartman "I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
"
8 5 Cartman "Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
8 5 Cartman "No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh... now ending fart sequence.
"
8 5 Cartman "Smell sequence initiated.
"
8 5 Cartman "Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame...
"
8 6 Cartman "I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
"
8 6 Cartman "No.
"
8 6 Cartman "Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
"
8 6 Cartman "They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
"
8 6 Cartman "They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train! Yay! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
"
8 6 Cartman "Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
"
8 6 Cartman "...Train together
"
8 6 Cartman "...I've got time. Do youuu??
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
8 6 Cartman "You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
"
8 6 Cartman "What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
8 6 Cartman "You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
"
8 6 Cartman "He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
"
8 6 Cartman "Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
8 6 Cartman "Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
"
8 6 Cartman "No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
"
8 6 Cartman "Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
"
8 7 Cartman "Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
"
8 7 Cartman "Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
"
8 7 Cartman "It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
"
8 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm takin' a break.
"
8 7 Cartman "Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
"
8 7 Cartman "It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
"
8 7 Cartman "Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
"
8 7 Cartman "Shoveling accident.
"
8 7 Cartman "You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
"
8 7 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
8 7 Cartman "We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Look, it's working! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
"
8 8 Cartman "Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Ye-heah!
"
8 8 Cartman "Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""
"
8 8 Cartman "Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
"
8 8 Cartman "It is not!
"
8 8 Cartman "Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
"
8 8 Cartman "...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
"
8 8 Cartman "It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
"
8 8 Cartman "A turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Awwwww!
"
8 8 Cartman "Okay. You win, Kyle.
"
8 8 Cartman "All right turd sandwich!
"
8 8 Cartman "Giant Douche sucks!
"
8 8 Cartman "Game on, Jew-boy!
"
8 8 Cartman "Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
"
8 8 Cartman "Hello, Clyde.
"
8 8 Cartman "We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
"
8 8 Cartman "Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
"
8 8 Cartman "You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
"
8 8 Cartman "So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
"
8 8 Cartman "Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
"
8 8 Cartman "Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
"
8 8 Cartman "Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh, no! Noooo!!
"
8 9 Cartman "You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
"
8 9 Cartman "Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, awesome!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
"
8 9 Cartman "What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "What? That's called progress, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
"
8 9 Cartman "No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh, awesome! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"
8 9 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
8 9 Cartman "I am not, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
"
8 9 Cartman "You heard what?
"
8 9 Cartman "That's not what I said! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
"
8 9 Cartman "I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
8 9 Cartman "Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
"
8 9 Cartman "You speak too much, sir!
"
8 9 Cartman "That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
"
8 9 Cartman "I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
"
8 9 Cartman "I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
"
8 10 Cartman "Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
"
8 10 Cartman "It's true.
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
"
8 10 Cartman "Jews can't be firemen.
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
8 10 Cartman "But how do we start a fire?
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't worry, Trent.
"
8 10 Cartman "Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever. That's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
"
8 10 Cartman "We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
8 10 Cartman "How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
8 10 Cartman "I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
"
8 10 Cartman "Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman """But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman "Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
"
8 10 Cartman "All right!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A picture of your mom's boobs?
"
8 10 Cartman "A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
8 10 Cartman "Aaaaaaaah!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Stay away from us, Trent!
"
8 10 Cartman "It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
8 10 Cartman "I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever, that's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
"
8 10 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hah! Hey!
"
8 11 Cartman "And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
8 11 Cartman "Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
"
8 11 Cartman "...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
"
8 11 Cartman "Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
"
8 11 Cartman "How many students is that?
"
8 11 Cartman "What is that butthole doing now?!
"
8 11 Cartman "Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
"
8 11 Cartman "...You're gay!
"
8 11 Cartman "Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
"
8 11 Cartman "God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
"
8 11 Cartman "Go play with yourself, Craig.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
"
8 11 Cartman "You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
8 11 Cartman "It should be Sexy News.
"
8 11 Cartman "Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
"
8 11 Cartman "Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
8 11 Cartman "And panda bears for the preschoolers.
"
8 11 Cartman "We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
"
8 11 Cartman "Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
8 11 Cartman "You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
"
8 11 Cartman "Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
"
8 11 Cartman "One testicle!  What an asshole! 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
"
8 11 Cartman "It's boring news, Jimmy.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, tell me about it.
"
8 11 Cartman "Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
8 11 Cartman "I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we have us, um... hmmm.
"
8 11 Cartman "Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
"
8 11 Cartman "They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
"
8 11 Cartman "Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
"
8 11 Cartman "We have crab people. Just sayin'.
"
8 11 Cartman "That sounds perfect.
"
8 11 Cartman "Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan, are you getting good ideas?
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh dude, I just got the best idea
"
8 11 Cartman "Dude, this TV show is awesome.
"
8 11 Cartman "I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
"
8 11 Cartman "They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
8 11 Cartman "Haha! In your face, Craig!
"
8 11 Cartman "This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
"
8 11 Cartman "...I think bail.
"
8 12 Cartman """Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
"
8 12 Cartman "Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, Goddammit!
"
8 13 Cartman "This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
"
8 13 Cartman "...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm gonna!
"
8 13 Cartman "Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
"
8 13 Cartman "Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
"
8 13 Cartman "And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Eugh... 
"
8 13 Cartman "Wheh? Where am I?
"
8 13 Cartman "Coma... How long?
"
8 13 Cartman "Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
"
8 13 Cartman "Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
"
8 13 Cartman "Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
"
8 13 Cartman "Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
"
8 13 Cartman "How come the outline is missing its hand?
"
8 13 Cartman "Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
"
8 13 Cartman "Guess again.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wow!
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
"
8 13 Cartman "Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
"
8 13 Cartman "Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
"
8 13 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
"
8 13 Cartman "What?
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
"
8 13 Cartman "No. Nothing.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
"
8 13 Cartman "It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
8 13 Cartman "If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
"
8 13 Cartman "More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
"
8 13 Cartman "Proper channels?
"
8 13 Cartman "I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
"
8 13 Cartman "Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
"
8 13 Cartman "Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
"
8 13 Cartman "In court?
"
8 13 Cartman "Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
8 13 Cartman "... 'Kay. Sweet.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
"
8 13 Cartman "Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't even know you dude!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, Jesus.
"
8 13 Cartman "No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
"
8 13 Cartman "Heheh.
"
8 13 Cartman "Yes yes, I see! 
"
8 13 Cartman "AAAAAAAH!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Come over here!)
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Help!) 
"
8 13 Cartman "No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
"
8 13 Cartman "Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
"
8 13 Cartman "You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
"
8 13 Cartman "You can't hurt me.
"
8 14 Cartman "I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
"
8 14 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
"
8 14 Cartman "All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
8 14 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
"
8 14 Cartman "That's not at all what happens.
"
8 14 Cartman """Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8 1 Cartman "Pfaha, so funny. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
"
8 1 Cartman "Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
"
8 1 Cartman "I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
8 1 Cartman "Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
"
8 1 Cartman "Kick ass! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Look what we got.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
"
8 1 Cartman "Ugh.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
"
8 1 Cartman "I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
8 1 Cartman "I have the power to have all the powers I want.
"
8 1 Cartman "C'mon!
"
8 1 Cartman "Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
"
8 1 Cartman "That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
"
8 1 Cartman "All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
"
8 1 Cartman "Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
8 1 Cartman "Oh, shit, dude!
"
8 1 Cartman "Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
"
8 1 Cartman "Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
"
8 1 Cartman "Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
"
8 1 Cartman "Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Dr. Shafley?
"
8 1 Cartman "So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
"
8 1 Cartman "Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
"
8 1 Cartman "Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
"
8 1 Cartman "In here! 
"
8 1 Cartman "No way, you got weapons too?!
"
8 1 Cartman "Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
"
8 1 Cartman "Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
"
8 1 Cartman "We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Here, Butters!
"
8 1 Cartman "Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
"
8 1 Cartman "Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
"
8 1 Cartman "Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
"
8 1 Cartman "All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
"
8 1 Cartman "What?
"
8 1 Cartman "I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
8 1 Cartman "Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
"
8 2 Cartman "The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
"
8 2 Cartman "What?
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
"
8 2 Cartman "What? What'd I do?
"
8 2 Cartman "You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
"
8 2 Cartman "Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
8 2 Cartman "So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
"
8 2 Cartman "It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
"
8 2 Cartman "Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Why?
"
8 2 Cartman "What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
"
8 2 Cartman "Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
"
8 2 Cartman "You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
"
8 2 Cartman "What?! 
"
8 2 Cartman "Moooommmm?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, could I get you to do something for me?
"
8 2 Cartman "Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
"
8 2 Cartman "I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
"
8 2 Cartman "...I'll split the money with you. 
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
"
8 2 Cartman "Awesome.
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Naaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
"
8 2 Cartman "Enter. 
"
8 2 Cartman "Go on, Kyle.
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
8 2 Cartman "Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
"
8 2 Cartman "Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
"
8 2 Cartman "One thousand dollars, yeah!
"
8 2 Cartman "Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
8 2 Cartman "Whoa. What the hell?? 
"
8 2 Cartman "Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
8 2 Cartman "God-damnit!
"
8 2 Cartman "Ah, screw you hippies!
"
8 2 Cartman "...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
"
8 2 Cartman "Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
8 2 Cartman "Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
"
8 3 Cartman "What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
"
8 3 Cartman "It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
8 3 Cartman "Set phasers on stun.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes. A little too quiet.
"
8 3 Cartman "Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
"
8 3 Cartman "Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
8 3 Cartman "How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
"
8 3 Cartman "Go see the movie, Kyle!
"
8 3 Cartman "You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
"
8 3 Cartman "Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
"
8 3 Cartman "Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Doorbell!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mom! Answer the door!
"
8 3 Cartman "God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 
"
8 3 Cartman "It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
"
8 3 Cartman "Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
"
8 3 Cartman "I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
"
8 3 Cartman "Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
"
8 3 Cartman "What?
"
8 3 Cartman "You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
"
8 3 Cartman "If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
"
8 3 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
"
8 3 Cartman "Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
"
8 3 Cartman "I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
"
8 3 Cartman "Eup. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
8 3 Cartman "Tell them I'll be down shortly
"
8 3 Cartman "Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
"
8 3 Cartman "But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
"
8 3 Cartman "Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
"
8 3 Cartman "Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
"
8 3 Cartman "One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
"
8 3 Cartman "And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""
"
8 3 Cartman "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Nice.
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8 3 Cartman "Juden!
"
8 3 Cartman "Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
"
8 3 Cartman "Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
"
8 4 Cartman "Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
"
8 4 Cartman "Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
8 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right!
"
8 4 Cartman "All right, Butters! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
"
8 5 Cartman "I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. I will be your new best friend.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
"
8 5 Cartman "That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, really?
"
8 5 Cartman "Heh. Wow, that sucks.
"
8 5 Cartman "Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
8 5 Cartman "Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "You saw that?
"
8 5 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
8 5 Cartman "No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
"
8 5 Cartman "Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
"
8 5 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
"
8 5 Cartman "Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
"
8 5 Cartman "...No way.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
"
8 5 Cartman "Where is it? Where is it?!
"
8 5 Cartman "Wah!
"
8 5 Cartman "Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O understands.
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
"
8 5 Cartman "I would like some Sunny Delight too.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
"
8 5 Cartman "Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
8 5 Cartman "Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
"
8 5 Cartman "Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
"
8 5 Cartman "Weak.
"
8 5 Cartman "Yes, of course. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
"
8 5 Cartman "What?
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame.
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
"
8 5 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Argh! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
"
8 5 Cartman "The New Orleans Saints. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Seventeen. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
"
8 5 Cartman "You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
"
8 5 Cartman "Haaaa! Haaaa!
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
8 5 Cartman "Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
"
8 5 Cartman "...What?
"
8 5 Cartman "AWESOM-O does not understand.
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame!
"
8 5 Cartman "Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Waaaaa! 
"
8 5 Cartman "Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
"
8 5 Cartman "Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
"
8 5 Cartman "The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
"
8 5 Cartman "I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
"
8 5 Cartman "Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
"
8 5 Cartman "Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
"
8 5 Cartman "Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
8 5 Cartman "No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
"
8 5 Cartman "I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
8 5 Cartman "Uh... now ending fart sequence.
"
8 5 Cartman "Smell sequence initiated.
"
8 5 Cartman "Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
"
8 5 Cartman "Lame...
"
8 6 Cartman "I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
"
8 6 Cartman "No.
"
8 6 Cartman "Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
"
8 6 Cartman "They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
"
8 6 Cartman "They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train! Yay! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
"
8 6 Cartman "Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
"
8 6 Cartman "...Train together
"
8 6 Cartman "...I've got time. Do youuu??
"
8 6 Cartman "Choo-choo train.
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
8 6 Cartman "You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
"
8 6 Cartman "What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
8 6 Cartman "You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
"
8 6 Cartman "He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
"
8 6 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
"
8 6 Cartman "Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
"
8 6 Cartman "Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
8 6 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
8 6 Cartman "Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
"
8 6 Cartman "Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
"
8 6 Cartman "No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
"
8 6 Cartman "Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
"
8 7 Cartman "Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
"
8 7 Cartman "Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
"
8 7 Cartman "It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
"
8 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm takin' a break.
"
8 7 Cartman "Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
"
8 7 Cartman "It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
"
8 7 Cartman "Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
"
8 7 Cartman "Shoveling accident.
"
8 7 Cartman "You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
"
8 7 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
8 7 Cartman "We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Look, it's working! 
"
8 7 Cartman "Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
"
8 8 Cartman "Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Ye-heah!
"
8 8 Cartman "Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""
"
8 8 Cartman "Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
"
8 8 Cartman "It is not!
"
8 8 Cartman "Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
"
8 8 Cartman "...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
"
8 8 Cartman "Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
"
8 8 Cartman "It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
"
8 8 Cartman "A turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Turd sandwich.
"
8 8 Cartman "Awwwww!
"
8 8 Cartman "Okay. You win, Kyle.
"
8 8 Cartman "All right turd sandwich!
"
8 8 Cartman "Giant Douche sucks!
"
8 8 Cartman "Game on, Jew-boy!
"
8 8 Cartman "Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
"
8 8 Cartman "Hello, Clyde.
"
8 8 Cartman "We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
"
8 8 Cartman "Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
"
8 8 Cartman "You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
"
8 8 Cartman "So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
"
8 8 Cartman "Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
"
8 8 Cartman "Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
"
8 8 Cartman "Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
"
8 8 Cartman "Oh, no! Noooo!!
"
8 9 Cartman "You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
"
8 9 Cartman "Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, awesome!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
"
8 9 Cartman "Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
"
8 9 Cartman "Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
"
8 9 Cartman "What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "What? That's called progress, Kyle.
"
8 9 Cartman "... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
"
8 9 Cartman "No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
"
8 9 Cartman "Oh, awesome! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
"
8 9 Cartman "Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"
8 9 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
8 9 Cartman "I am not, Kyle!
"
8 9 Cartman "Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
"
8 9 Cartman "You heard what?
"
8 9 Cartman "That's not what I said! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
"
8 9 Cartman "I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
8 9 Cartman "Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
"
8 9 Cartman "You speak too much, sir!
"
8 9 Cartman "That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
"
8 9 Cartman "I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "No, you didn't.
"
8 9 Cartman "...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
"
8 9 Cartman "I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
"
8 9 Cartman "Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
"
8 10 Cartman "Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
"
8 10 Cartman "It's true.
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
"
8 10 Cartman "Jews can't be firemen.
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
8 10 Cartman "But how do we start a fire?
"
8 10 Cartman "Don't worry, Trent.
"
8 10 Cartman "Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever. That's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
"
8 10 Cartman "We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
8 10 Cartman "How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
8 10 Cartman "I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
"
8 10 Cartman "Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman """But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8 10 Cartman "Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
"
8 10 Cartman "Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
"
8 10 Cartman "All right!
"
8 10 Cartman "You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
"
8 10 Cartman "He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
"
8 10 Cartman "A picture of your mom's boobs?
"
8 10 Cartman "A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
8 10 Cartman "Aaaaaaaah!
"
8 10 Cartman "Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
8 10 Cartman "Stay away from us, Trent!
"
8 10 Cartman "It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
8 10 Cartman "I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
"
8 10 Cartman "Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8 10 Cartman "Whatever, that's like five years from now.
"
8 10 Cartman "We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
"
8 10 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
8 10 Cartman "Hah! Hey!
"
8 11 Cartman "And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
8 11 Cartman "Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
"
8 11 Cartman "...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
"
8 11 Cartman "Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
"
8 11 Cartman "How many students is that?
"
8 11 Cartman "What is that butthole doing now?!
"
8 11 Cartman "Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
"
8 11 Cartman "...You're gay!
"
8 11 Cartman "Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
"
8 11 Cartman "God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
"
8 11 Cartman "Go play with yourself, Craig.
"
8 11 Cartman "Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
"
8 11 Cartman "You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
8 11 Cartman "It should be Sexy News.
"
8 11 Cartman "Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
"
8 11 Cartman "Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
8 11 Cartman "And panda bears for the preschoolers.
"
8 11 Cartman "We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
"
8 11 Cartman "Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
8 11 Cartman "You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
"
8 11 Cartman "Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
"
8 11 Cartman "One testicle!  What an asshole! 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
"
8 11 Cartman "Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
"
8 11 Cartman "It's boring news, Jimmy.
"
8 11 Cartman "All right, tell me about it.
"
8 11 Cartman "Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
8 11 Cartman "I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we have us, um... hmmm.
"
8 11 Cartman "Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
"
8 11 Cartman "They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
"
8 11 Cartman "Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
"
8 11 Cartman "How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
"
8 11 Cartman "We have crab people. Just sayin'.
"
8 11 Cartman "That sounds perfect.
"
8 11 Cartman "Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan, are you getting good ideas?
"
8 11 Cartman "Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
"
8 11 Cartman "Oh dude, I just got the best idea
"
8 11 Cartman "Dude, this TV show is awesome.
"
8 11 Cartman "I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
"
8 11 Cartman "They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
"
8 11 Cartman "And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
8 11 Cartman "Haha! In your face, Craig!
"
8 11 Cartman "This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
"
8 11 Cartman "...I think bail.
"
8 12 Cartman """Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
"
8 12 Cartman "Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
"
8 12 Cartman "Oh, Goddammit!
"
8 13 Cartman "This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
"
8 13 Cartman "...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm gonna!
"
8 13 Cartman "Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
"
8 13 Cartman "Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
"
8 13 Cartman "And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Eugh... 
"
8 13 Cartman "Wheh? Where am I?
"
8 13 Cartman "Coma... How long?
"
8 13 Cartman "Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
"
8 13 Cartman "Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
"
8 13 Cartman "Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
"
8 13 Cartman "Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
"
8 13 Cartman "How come the outline is missing its hand?
"
8 13 Cartman "Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
"
8 13 Cartman "Guess again.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wow!
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
"
8 13 Cartman "Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
"
8 13 Cartman "Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
"
8 13 Cartman "Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
"
8 13 Cartman "Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
"
8 13 Cartman "What?
"
8 13 Cartman "I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
"
8 13 Cartman "No. Nothing.
"
8 13 Cartman "Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
"
8 13 Cartman "It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
8 13 Cartman "If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
"
8 13 Cartman "More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
"
8 13 Cartman "Proper channels?
"
8 13 Cartman "I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
"
8 13 Cartman "Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
"
8 13 Cartman "Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
"
8 13 Cartman "In court?
"
8 13 Cartman "Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
8 13 Cartman "... 'Kay. Sweet.
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
"
8 13 Cartman "Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
"
8 13 Cartman "I don't even know you dude!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, Jesus.
"
8 13 Cartman "No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
"
8 13 Cartman "Heheh.
"
8 13 Cartman "Yes yes, I see! 
"
8 13 Cartman "AAAAAAAH!
"
8 13 Cartman "Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Come over here!)
"
8 13 Cartman "(Hey! Help!) 
"
8 13 Cartman "No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
"
8 13 Cartman "Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
"
8 13 Cartman "You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
"
8 13 Cartman "You can't hurt me.
"
8 14 Cartman "I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
"
8 14 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
"
8 14 Cartman "All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
8 14 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
"
8 14 Cartman "That's not at all what happens.
"
8 14 Cartman """Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
