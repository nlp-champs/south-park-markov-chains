6 1 Butters "Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!

6 1 Butters "Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.

6 1 Butters "Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.

6 1 Butters "Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.

6 1 Butters "Hey fellas.
"
6 1 Butters "Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.

"
6 1 Butters "Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
"
6 1 Butters "Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
"
6 1 Butters "Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
"
6 1 Butters "No- but you don't sound like me.
"
6 1 Butters "Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
"
6 1 Butters "Huh. Huh, uh, uh.

6 3 Butters "Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
"
6 3 Butters "But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
"
6 3 Butters "I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
"
6 3 Butters "...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
"
6 3 Butters "Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?

"
6 3 Butters "Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
"
6 3 Butters "Uhhh, yeah.
"
6 3 Butters "They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
"
6 3 Butters "I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
"
6 3 Butters "Uh what condition?

"
6 5 Butters "I'm sure! There's no way!
"
6 5 Butters "Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
"
6 5 Butters "No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
"
6 5 Butters "They have to show it! They promised they would!
"
6 5 Butters "Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
"
6 5 Butters "Yeah. 
"
6 5 Butters "How far away is June?
"
6 6 Butters "Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
"
6 6 Butters "Wuh well, sure. 
"
6 6 Butters "Wull what is it?
"
6 6 Butters "Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
"
6 6 Butters "Not working out?
"
6 6 Butters "Well, but ah I can get better.
"
6 6 Butters "Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
"
6 6 Butters "Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
"
6 6 Butters "The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
"
6 6 Butters "Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
"
6 6 Butters "Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
"
6 6 Butters "I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
"
6 6 Butters "Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 
"
6 6 Butters "Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
"
6 6 Butters "It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
"
6 6 Butters "Yeh, you didn't? 
"
6 6 Butters "Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
"
6 6 Butters "Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
"
6 6 Butters "Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
"
6 6 Butters "So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
"
6 6 Butters "Ms. Choksondik,
"
6 6 Butters "Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
"
6 6 Butters "Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
"
6 6 Butters "The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
"
6 6 Butters "I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
"
6 6 Butters "Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
"
6 6 Butters "Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
"
6 6 Butters "It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
"
6 6 Butters "A note?
"
6 6 Butters "Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
"
6 6 Butters "Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
"
6 6 Butters "Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
"
6 6 Butters "Join me?
"
6 6 Butters "But why?
"
6 6 Butters "Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
"
6 6 Butters "Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
"
6 6 Butters "Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
"
6 6 Butters "People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
"
6 6 Butters "Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
"
6 6 Butters "Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
"
6 6 Butters "Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
"
6 6 Butters "Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
"
6 6 Butters "Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
"
6 6 Butters "Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
"
6 6 Butters "Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
"
6 6 Butters "This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 
"
6 6 Butters "Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
"
6 7 Butters "Hey, fellas.
"
6 7 Butters "How are things... oing with your new best friend?
"
6 7 Butters "Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
"
6 7 Butters "Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
"
6 7 Butters "Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
"
6 7 Butters "Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
"
6 7 Butters "Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
"
6 7 Butters "Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
"
6 7 Butters "Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
"
6 7 Butters "Huh?
"
6 7 Butters "He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
"
6 7 Butters "Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
"
6 7 Butters "General Disarray, are your parents home?
"
6 7 Butters "Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
"
6 7 Butters "You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
"
6 7 Butters "Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
"
6 7 Butters "Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
"
6 7 Butters "I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
"
6 7 Butters "Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
"
6 7 Butters "Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
"
6 7 Butters "Stupid Simpsons...
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
"
6 7 Butters "I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
"
6 7 Butters "Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
"
6 7 Butters "Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
"
6 7 Butters "Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
"
6 7 Butters "Dwaah!!
"
6 7 Butters "I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
"
6 7 Butters "Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!

"
6 16 Butters "Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
"
6 16 Butters "I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
"
6 16 Butters "I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
"
6 16 Butters "Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
"
6 16 Butters "Nobody asked.
"
6 16 Butters "Probably watching Becker.
"
6 16 Butters "See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?

"
6 16 Butters "Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 
"
6 16 Butters "I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
"
6 16 Butters "Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah, I can't believe it!
"
6 16 Butters "This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
"
6 16 Butters "Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
"
6 16 Butters "Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
"
6 16 Butters "Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
"
6 16 Butters "You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
"
6 16 Butters "Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
"
6 16 Butters "Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see.

6 6 Butters "The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
"
6 6 Butters "Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
"
6 6 Butters "Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
"
6 6 Butters "I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
"
6 6 Butters "Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 
"
6 6 Butters "Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
"
6 6 Butters "It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
"
6 6 Butters "Yeh, you didn't? 
"
6 6 Butters "Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
"
6 6 Butters "Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
"
6 6 Butters "Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
"
6 6 Butters "So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
"
6 6 Butters "Ms. Choksondik,
"
6 6 Butters "Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
"
6 6 Butters "Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
"
6 6 Butters "The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
"
6 6 Butters "I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
"
6 6 Butters "Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
"
6 6 Butters "Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
"
6 6 Butters "It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
"
6 6 Butters "A note?
"
6 6 Butters "Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
"
6 6 Butters "Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
"
6 6 Butters "Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
"
6 6 Butters "Join me?
"
6 6 Butters "But why?
"
6 6 Butters "Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
"
6 6 Butters "Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
"
6 6 Butters "Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
"
6 6 Butters "People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
"
6 6 Butters "Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
"
6 6 Butters "Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
"
6 6 Butters "Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
"
6 6 Butters "Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
"
6 6 Butters "Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
"
6 6 Butters "Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
"
6 6 Butters "Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
"
6 6 Butters "This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 
"
6 6 Butters "Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
"
6 7 Butters "Hey, fellas.
"
6 7 Butters "How are things... oing with your new best friend?
"
6 7 Butters "Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
"
6 7 Butters "Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
"
6 7 Butters "Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
"
6 7 Butters "Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
"
6 7 Butters "Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
"
6 7 Butters "Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
"
6 7 Butters "Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
"
6 7 Butters "Huh?
"
6 7 Butters "He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
"
6 7 Butters "Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
"
6 7 Butters "General Disarray, are your parents home?
"
6 7 Butters "Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
"
6 7 Butters "You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
"
6 7 Butters "Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
"
6 7 Butters "Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
"
6 7 Butters "I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
"
6 7 Butters "Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
"
6 7 Butters "Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
"
6 7 Butters "Stupid Simpsons...
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
"
6 7 Butters "Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
"
6 7 Butters "I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
"
6 7 Butters "Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
"
6 7 Butters "Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
"
6 7 Butters "Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
"
6 7 Butters "Dwaah!!
"
6 7 Butters "I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
"
6 7 Butters "Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
"
6 7 Butters "Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
"
6 7 Butters "No! No! 
"
6 7 Butters "Aaaaah!
"
6 7 Butters "Oh sweet Jesus!
"
6 7 Butters "Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
"
6 7 Butters "Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
"
6 7 Butters "Haaah! 
"
6 7 Butters "Aaah! Nooo! 
"
6 7 Butters "Haaa!
"
6 7 Butters "Cartman?
"
6 7 Butters "Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
"
6 7 Butters "They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
"
6 7 Butters "Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
"
6 7 Butters "I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
"
6 8 Butters "Compassionate.
"
6 8 Butters "You mean, like a goldfish?
"
6 10 Butters "Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
"
6 10 Butters "Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
"
6 10 Butters "Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
"
6 10 Butters "Uh here comes an SUV. 
"
6 10 Butters "Me too!
"
6 10 Butters "Stupider than Bebe!
"
6 10 Butters "Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
"
6 10 Butters "Yeah!

6 10 Butters "Uhyep.

6 14 Butters "No more... arts and crafts...
"
6 16 Butters "Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
"
6 16 Butters "Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
"
6 16 Butters "I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
"
6 16 Butters "I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
"
6 16 Butters "Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
"
6 16 Butters "Nobody asked.
"
6 16 Butters "Probably watching Becker.
"
6 16 Butters "See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
"
6 16 Butters "Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
"
6 16 Butters "Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
"
6 16 Butters "I don't follow.
"
6 16 Butters "Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 
"
6 16 Butters "I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
"
6 16 Butters "Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah, I can't believe it!
"
6 16 Butters "This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
"
6 16 Butters "Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
"
6 16 Butters "Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
"
6 16 Butters "Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
"
6 16 Butters "You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
"
6 16 Butters "Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
"
6 16 Butters "Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
"
6 16 Butters "Now you know my terrible secret!
"
6 16 Butters "Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
"
6 16 Butters "Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
"
6 16 Butters "How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
"
6 16 Butters "Wow, look at this, Stan.  ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed.""
"
6 16 Butters "Hey look, somebody lost their pet.

6 16 Butters "Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
"
6 16 Butters "This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
"
6 16 Butters "Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
"
6 16 Butters "Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
"
6 16 Butters "You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah!

6 16 Butters "Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
"
6 16 Butters "Poop- poop swatches?

6 16 Butters "Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
"
6 16 Butters "Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
"
6 16 Butters "Well that sounds good.
"
6 16 Butters "Hooray!
"
6 16 Butters "Wow! Neato!
"
6 16 Butters "Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
"
6 16 Butters "Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
"
6 16 Butters "Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
"
6 16 Butters "Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 
"
6 16 Butters "Oh, Stan!
"
6 16 Butters "Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
"
6 16 Butters "We are?
"
6 16 Butters "Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
"
6 16 Butters "Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
"
