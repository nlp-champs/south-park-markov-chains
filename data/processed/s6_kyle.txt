6 1 Kyle "Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
6 1 Kyle "Dude! That's today!
"
6 1 Kyle "Excuse me? Could we get through here?
"
6 1 Kyle "Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
"
6 1 Kyle "Them?
"
6 1 Kyle "Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.
"
6 1 Kyle "Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
"
6 1 Kyle "But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
"
6 1 Kyle "It matters, dude. 
"
6 1 Kyle "That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
"
6 1 Kyle "Tha- that's diarrhea.
"
6 1 Kyle "That's a great idea!
"
6 1 Kyle "But Butters isn't fat.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
"
6 1 Kyle "City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
"
6 1 Kyle "Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
"
6 1 Kyle "You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
"
6 1 Kyle "Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow! He looks great!
"
6 1 Kyle "Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
"
6 1 Kyle "Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, we're all set.
"
6 1 Kyle "Well, what do you mean?
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow! 
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, you're still fat!
"
6 1 Kyle "Why are you doing this to us?!
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
"
6 1 Kyle "The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
"
6 1 Kyle "Alright, it's working!
"
6 1 Kyle "It's out of control! 
"
6 1 Kyle "To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
"
6 1 Kyle "Yep.
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow, that was pretty good.
"
6 1 Kyle "We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
"
6 1 Kyle "Uh, why not?
"
6 1 Kyle "Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
"
6 1 Kyle "Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
"
6 2 Kyle "No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
"
6 2 Kyle "What
"
6 2 Kyle "Go on, Ike.
"
6 2 Kyle "...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
"
6 2 Kyle "...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
"
6 2 Kyle "Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
"
6 2 Kyle "What do you wanna do now?
"
6 2 Kyle "Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
"
6 2 Kyle "You don't even know Heather!
"
6 2 Kyle "Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
"
6 2 Kyle "I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
"
6 2 Kyle "Awgh, dude, I can't look. 
"
6 2 Kyle "Good job, dude!
"
6 2 Kyle "Mom, Dad!
"
6 2 Kyle "Yeah, what a stupid sport! 
"
6 3 Kyle "Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
6 3 Kyle "This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
"
6 3 Kyle "Cool!
"
6 3 Kyle "Do you think they'll believe it?
"
6 3 Kyle "Awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
"
6 3 Kyle "We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
"
6 3 Kyle "We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
"
6 3 Kyle "That looks awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah, he sure is.
"
6 3 Kyle "This is gonna be awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "Wow!
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
"
6 4 Kyle "City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
"
6 4 Kyle "Aw, dude. 
"
6 4 Kyle "Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??
"
6 4 Kyle "What??
"
6 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 4 Kyle "Come on, we've gotta go!
"
6 4 Kyle "'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
"
6 4 Kyle "What?!
"
6 4 Kyle "Screw you, Cartman!
"
6 4 Kyle "No!
"
6 4 Kyle "Have Butters kiss it.
"
6 4 Kyle "Awww! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Sick! I felt it on my face!
"
6 4 Kyle "Hyaaaa! 
"
6 4 Kyle "You need to freeze some of your ass off.
"
6 4 Kyle "What? 
"
6 4 Kyle "Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
"
6 4 Kyle "Butters has that at his house?
"
6 4 Kyle "All right!
"
6 4 Kyle "Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
"
6 4 Kyle "You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 
"
6 4 Kyle "So what happens now?
"
6 4 Kyle "We're with you, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "We're with you, Stan.
"
6 4 Kyle "...No I won't.
"
6 4 Kyle "Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
"
6 4 Kyle "Cartman, stay away from that door!
"
6 4 Kyle "But we will have to sleep, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "Good night.
"
6 4 Kyle "We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
"
6 4 Kyle "He might be right, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "All right!
"
6 4 Kyle "Yeah! And fried chicken! 
"
6 4 Kyle "We're eating, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, that's messed up. 
"
6 4 Kyle "You guys, check this out! 
"
6 4 Kyle "It is?
"
6 4 Kyle "Huh, what the hell is that?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, are you okay?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, maybe we should end this.
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't give him anything!
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan's getting worse, you guys.
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan! It worked!
"
6 4 Kyle "They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
"
6 4 Kyle "Mexico here we come! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
"
6 4 Kyle "Oh no! No!!
"
6 4 Kyle "Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
"
6 4 Kyle "Whoa, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
"
6 5 Kyle "Do we have everything?
"
6 5 Kyle "Look, it's almost time.
"
6 5 Kyle "It's the biggest night of the year.
"
6 5 Kyle "Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
"
6 5 Kyle "You'd miss the new trailer?
"
6 5 Kyle "Kyle.
"
6 5 Kyle "Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
"
6 5 Kyle "Dude, thank God for stupid people 
"
6 5 Kyle "Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
"
6 5 Kyle "Just just leave it alone.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
"
6 5 Kyle "We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
"
6 5 Kyle "No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
"
6 5 Kyle "They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
"
6 5 Kyle "But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
"
6 5 Kyle "Heuh, the commercials! 
"
6 5 Kyle "Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
"
6 5 Kyle "Get it back to normal, Chef!
"
6 5 Kyle "The TV left.
"
6 5 Kyle "We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
"
6 5 Kyle "We're not too late! 
"
6 5 Kyle "They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
"
6 5 Kyle "Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
"
6 5 Kyle "That'd disgusting, dude!
"
6 5 Kyle "It's okay, it's still the show.
"
6 5 Kyle "Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
"
6 5 Kyle "Will your sister let us watch it?
"
6 5 Kyle "Look! Crack addicts with a television! 
"
6 5 Kyle "Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
"
6 5 Kyle "Well why not?!
"
6 5 Kyle "This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
"
6 5 Kyle "The last commercial break is starting!
"
6 5 Kyle "What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
"
6 5 Kyle "That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
"
6 5 Kyle "They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
"
6 5 Kyle "It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
"
6 6 Kyle "Who wants to tell him?
"
6 6 Kyle "Lame
"
6 6 Kyle "But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
"
6 6 Kyle "We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
"
6 6 Kyle "Phew.
"
6 6 Kyle "Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
"
6 6 Kyle "But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
"
6 6 Kyle "Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
"
6 6 Kyle "Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek.
"
6 6 Kyle "This looks pretty good.
"
6 6 Kyle "You're such a fatass, Cartman!
"
6 6 Kyle "Token.
"
6 6 Kyle "Timmy.
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek.  Pip
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie.
"
6 6 Kyle "Jimmy.
"
6 6 Kyle "Anything that'll impress us, Token.
"
6 6 Kyle "Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
"
6 6 Kyle "Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
"
6 6 Kyle "Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
"
6 6 Kyle "So? You're a smartass!
"
6 6 Kyle "Good point. 
"
6 6 Kyle "Cool.
"
6 7 Kyle "Just stick it on.
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 7 Kyle "Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 7 Kyle "No way.
"
6 7 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
6 7 Kyle "No way.
"
6 7 Kyle "Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Ah, alright.
"
6 7 Kyle "I told you, Cartman.
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"
6 7 Kyle "See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
"
6 7 Kyle "Oh God!
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
"
6 7 Kyle "We don't know who else to talk to.
"
6 7 Kyle "Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
"
6 7 Kyle "There's nothing here! 
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
"
6 7 Kyle "Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Quick. Hide. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Got it!
"
6 7 Kyle "It is?
"
6 7 Kyle "Oh, really?? 
"
6 7 Kyle "I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Whoa. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Whoa.
"
6 7 Kyle "Well what are you gonna do?
"
6 7 Kyle "Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
"
6 7 Kyle "Huh.
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
"
6 7 Kyle "...Yeah. So?
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey! It's Tweek.
"
6 7 Kyle "The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
"
6 7 Kyle "Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
"
6 8 Kyle "Hey dudes.
"
6 8 Kyle "What are you guys doin'?
"
6 8 Kyle "In your butts?
"
6 8 Kyle "Why would he put anything in your butts?
"
6 8 Kyle "Hm. 
"
6 8 Kyle "Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
"
6 8 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 8 Kyle "Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
"
6 8 Kyle "It wouldn't work!
"
6 8 Kyle "I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
"
6 8 Kyle "You're on, fat boy!
"
6 8 Kyle "Well, Cartman?
"
6 8 Kyle "Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
"
6 8 Kyle "No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
"
6 8 Kyle "Get the fuck out of here!
"
6 8 Kyle "What?
"
6 8 Kyle "Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
"
6 8 Kyle "Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
6 8 Kyle "So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
"
6 8 Kyle "It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
"
6 8 Kyle "HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
6 8 Kyle "So?
"
6 8 Kyle "Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
"
6 8 Kyle "You were totally, one hundred percent right.
"
6 8 Kyle "You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
"
6 9 Kyle "No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.
"
6 9 Kyle "Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club
"
6 9 Kyle """Free hat?""
"
6 9 Kyle "Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
"
6 9 Kyle "Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
"
6 9 Kyle "We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
"
6 9 Kyle "What?
"
6 9 Kyle "Yah.
"
6 9 Kyle "You?? Why?
"
6 9 Kyle "Me.
"
6 9 Kyle "Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
"
6 9 Kyle "We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
"
6 9 Kyle "Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
"
6 9 Kyle "Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
"
6 9 Kyle "No. NOO!!
"
6 9 Kyle "Nonono! We need to do this first.
"
6 9 Kyle "We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
"
6 9 Kyle "This looks like the right room.
"
6 9 Kyle "That's it!
"
6 9 Kyle "Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
6 9 Kyle "...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
"
6 9 Kyle "Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
"
6 9 Kyle "It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
"
6 9 Kyle "You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
"
6 9 Kyle "When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
"
6 9 Kyle "Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
"
6 9 Kyle "What??
"
6 9 Kyle "Yup.
"
6 9 Kyle "Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah. I I think so.
"
6 9 Kyle "...What? 
"
6 9 Kyle "Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
"
6 10 Kyle "She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
"
6 10 Kyle "Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
"
6 10 Kyle "I don't know. 
"
6 10 Kyle "Dude! Bebe is really smart!
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah, it's cool.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah. She's really cool. 
"
6 10 Kyle "That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
"
6 10 Kyle "I'm showing her.
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh!
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
"
6 10 Kyle "Hah hah hah!
"
6 10 Kyle "We were throwing rocks at cars.
"
6 10 Kyle "Maybe she's in the lunch line.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yep.
"
6 10 Kyle "Right.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 10 Kyle "Huh??
"
6 10 Kyle "Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
"
6 10 Kyle "No way! Tweek's cool!
"
6 10 Kyle "I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?
"
6 10 Kyle "Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
"
6 10 Kyle "Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
"
6 10 Kyle "But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
"
6 10 Kyle "Boobs are stupid!
"
6 11 Kyle "It will.
"
6 11 Kyle "So?
"
6 11 Kyle "Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
"
6 11 Kyle "But, wait. Where's the other team? 
"
6 11 Kyle "Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
"
6 11 Kyle "You're such a fatass, Cartman.
"
6 11 Kyle "Yeah, it was like four days ago!
"
6 12 Kyle "It was such a long time ago!
"
6 12 Kyle "Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
"
6 12 Kyle "Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6 12 Kyle "We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah. Closure.
"
6 12 Kyle "There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Alright, we made it!
"
6 12 Kyle "Let him out, Cartman! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Is he in there?
"
6 12 Kyle "I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
"
6 12 Kyle "Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
"
6 12 Kyle "A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
"
6 12 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Maybe you got brain cancer.
"
6 12 Kyle "Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
"
6 12 Kyle "Do you see anything?
"
6 12 Kyle "Grandma??
"
6 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
6 12 Kyle "What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
"
6 12 Kyle "HAAHH!!! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Hey Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "You're too fat to be Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "What?? For God's sake, why??
"
6 12 Kyle "Are you gonna burn me?
"
6 12 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
6 12 Kyle "You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
"
6 12 Kyle "We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!"
6 12 Kyle "Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6 12 Kyle "What do you mean, fatass?
"
6 12 Kyle "Do you see anything?
"
6 12 Kyle "Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
"
6 12 Kyle "Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
"
6 12 Kyle "Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
"
6 12 Kyle "Stop him, Kenny! 
"
6 13 Kyle "That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
"
6 13 Kyle "But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
"
6 13 Kyle "Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"
6 13 Kyle "I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
"
6 13 Kyle "Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
"
6 13 Kyle "Gentlemen, we are off! 
"
6 13 Kyle "The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
"
6 13 Kyle "Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
"
6 13 Kyle "Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
"
6 13 Kyle "This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
"
6 13 Kyle "You can't keep it.
"
6 13 Kyle "Dude, that video is making people act strange.
"
6 13 Kyle "We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
"
6 13 Kyle "Hide! 
"
6 13 Kyle "Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
"
6 13 Kyle "Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
"
6 13 Kyle "We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
"
6 13 Kyle "This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
"
6 13 Kyle "Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
"
6 13 Kyle "Paladin!
"
6 13 Kyle "We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
"
6 13 Kyle "We were almost killed.
"
6 13 Kyle "Hey, what are you guys doing? 
"
6 13 Kyle "You guys. Somebody is following us.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters?
"
6 13 Kyle "Jimmy, are you sure?
"
6 13 Kyle "They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
"
6 13 Kyle "Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh brother!
"
6 13 Kyle "No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh no! They're closed!
"
6 13 Kyle "Finally.  It's over.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters! No!
"
6 13 Kyle "It has to go back!
"
6 13 Kyle "Let go of the tape, Butters!
"
6 13 Kyle "Fine! 
"
6 13 Kyle "Middle-earth is again safe.
"
6 14 Kyle "Funny.
"
6 14 Kyle "Not him!
"
6 14 Kyle "Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"
6 14 Kyle "Hey guys, can we talk to you? 
"
6 14 Kyle "Uhh, not cool.
"
6 14 Kyle "Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
"
6 14 Kyle """Fat tits."" That's a good one.
"
6 14 Kyle "Bad.
"
6 14 Kyle "Gays, I guess.
"
6 14 Kyle "Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
"
6 14 Kyle "We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
"
6 14 Kyle "Uh, a bear?
"
6 14 Kyle "Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
"
6 14 Kyle "Aaaa! 
"
6 14 Kyle "People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
"
6 14 Kyle "Oh.
"
6 14 Kyle "Can't... glue... any... more. 
"
6 15 Kyle "Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
"
6 15 Kyle "Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
"
6 15 Kyle "Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
"
6 15 Kyle "We're gong to New York?
"
6 15 Kyle "Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
"
6 15 Kyle "We have a dead friend.
"
6 15 Kyle "Yee-yeah.
"
6 15 Kyle "I'm Kyle.
"
6 15 Kyle "Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?
"
6 15 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
6 15 Kyle "Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
"
6 15 Kyle "Four white birds!
"
6 15 Kyle "There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
"
6 15 Kyle "So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
"
6 15 Kyle "I'm not going back.
"
6 15 Kyle "I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
"
6 15 Kyle "Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
"
6 15 Kyle "He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
"
6 15 Kyle "You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
"
6 15 Kyle "You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
"
6 16 Kyle "Throw it away, Clyde!
"
6 16 Kyle "Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
"
6 16 Kyle "What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
"
6 16 Kyle "...Where did you have sex with her?
"
6 16 Kyle "Wow. That's pretty cool.
"
6 16 Kyle "'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
"
6 16 Kyle "Hey, what happens to me in the future?
"
6 17 Kyle "What are you doing, Cartman?
"
6 17 Kyle "What's it?
"
6 17 Kyle "That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
"
6 17 Kyle "Mr. Hankey! 
"
6 17 Kyle "Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
"
6 17 Kyle "But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
"
6 17 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
6 17 Kyle "Me neither.
"
6 17 Kyle "Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
"
6 17 Kyle "Finally!
"
6 17 Kyle "Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
"
6 17 Kyle "Wow, cool!
"
6 17 Kyle "Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
"
6 17 Kyle "Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
"
6 17 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
6 17 Kyle "Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
"
6 17 Kyle "All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
"
6 17 Kyle "We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"
6 17 Kyle "Jesus, behind you! 
"
6 17 Kyle "You bastards. 
"
6 17 Kyle "On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
"
6 17 Kyle "Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
"
6 17 Kyle "Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"
6 17 Kyle "Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
"
6 17 Kyle "Dude, where have you been?
"
6 17 Kyle "Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
"
6 1 Kyle "Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
6 1 Kyle "Dude! That's today!
"
6 1 Kyle "Excuse me? Could we get through here?
"
6 1 Kyle "Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
"
6 1 Kyle "Them?
"
6 1 Kyle "Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.
"
6 1 Kyle "Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
"
6 1 Kyle "But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
"
6 1 Kyle "It matters, dude. 
"
6 1 Kyle "That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
"
6 1 Kyle "Tha- that's diarrhea.
"
6 1 Kyle "That's a great idea!
"
6 1 Kyle "But Butters isn't fat.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
"
6 1 Kyle "City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
"
6 1 Kyle "Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
"
6 1 Kyle "You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
"
6 1 Kyle "Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow! He looks great!
"
6 1 Kyle "Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
"
6 1 Kyle "Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, we're all set.
"
6 1 Kyle "Well, what do you mean?
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow! 
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, you're still fat!
"
6 1 Kyle "Why are you doing this to us?!
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
"
6 1 Kyle "Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
"
6 1 Kyle "The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
"
6 1 Kyle "Alright, it's working!
"
6 1 Kyle "It's out of control! 
"
6 1 Kyle "To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
"
6 1 Kyle "Yep.
"
6 1 Kyle "Wow, that was pretty good.
"
6 1 Kyle "We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
"
6 1 Kyle "Uh, why not?
"
6 1 Kyle "Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
"
6 1 Kyle "Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
"
6 1 Kyle "Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
"
6 2 Kyle "No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
"
6 2 Kyle "What
"
6 2 Kyle "Go on, Ike.
"
6 2 Kyle "...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
"
6 2 Kyle "...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
"
6 2 Kyle "Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
"
6 2 Kyle "What do you wanna do now?
"
6 2 Kyle "Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
"
6 2 Kyle "You don't even know Heather!
"
6 2 Kyle "Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
"
6 2 Kyle "I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
"
6 2 Kyle "Awgh, dude, I can't look. 
"
6 2 Kyle "Good job, dude!
"
6 2 Kyle "Mom, Dad!
"
6 2 Kyle "Yeah, what a stupid sport! 
"
6 3 Kyle "Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
6 3 Kyle "This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
"
6 3 Kyle "Cool!
"
6 3 Kyle "Do you think they'll believe it?
"
6 3 Kyle "Awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
"
6 3 Kyle "We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
"
6 3 Kyle "We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
"
6 3 Kyle "That looks awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah, he sure is.
"
6 3 Kyle "This is gonna be awesome!
"
6 3 Kyle "Wow!
"
6 3 Kyle "Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
"
6 4 Kyle "City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
"
6 4 Kyle "Aw, dude. 
"
6 4 Kyle "Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??
"
6 4 Kyle "What??
"
6 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 4 Kyle "Come on, we've gotta go!
"
6 4 Kyle "'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
"
6 4 Kyle "What?!
"
6 4 Kyle "Screw you, Cartman!
"
6 4 Kyle "No!
"
6 4 Kyle "Have Butters kiss it.
"
6 4 Kyle "Awww! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Sick! I felt it on my face!
"
6 4 Kyle "Hyaaaa! 
"
6 4 Kyle "You need to freeze some of your ass off.
"
6 4 Kyle "What? 
"
6 4 Kyle "Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
"
6 4 Kyle "Butters has that at his house?
"
6 4 Kyle "All right!
"
6 4 Kyle "Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
"
6 4 Kyle "You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 
"
6 4 Kyle "So what happens now?
"
6 4 Kyle "We're with you, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "We're with you, Stan.
"
6 4 Kyle "...No I won't.
"
6 4 Kyle "Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
"
6 4 Kyle "Cartman, stay away from that door!
"
6 4 Kyle "But we will have to sleep, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "Good night.
"
6 4 Kyle "We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
"
6 4 Kyle "He might be right, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "All right!
"
6 4 Kyle "Yeah! And fried chicken! 
"
6 4 Kyle "We're eating, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, that's messed up. 
"
6 4 Kyle "You guys, check this out! 
"
6 4 Kyle "It is?
"
6 4 Kyle "Huh, what the hell is that?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, are you okay?
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude, maybe we should end this.
"
6 4 Kyle "Don't give him anything!
"
6 4 Kyle "Dude! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan's getting worse, you guys.
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan! It worked!
"
6 4 Kyle "They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
"
6 4 Kyle "Mexico here we come! 
"
6 4 Kyle "Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
"
6 4 Kyle "Oh no! No!!
"
6 4 Kyle "Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
"
6 4 Kyle "Whoa, dude.
"
6 4 Kyle "But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
"
6 5 Kyle "Do we have everything?
"
6 5 Kyle "Look, it's almost time.
"
6 5 Kyle "It's the biggest night of the year.
"
6 5 Kyle "Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
"
6 5 Kyle "You'd miss the new trailer?
"
6 5 Kyle "Kyle.
"
6 5 Kyle "Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
"
6 5 Kyle "Dude, thank God for stupid people 
"
6 5 Kyle "Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
"
6 5 Kyle "Just just leave it alone.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
"
6 5 Kyle "We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
"
6 5 Kyle "No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
"
6 5 Kyle "They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
"
6 5 Kyle "But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
"
6 5 Kyle "God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
"
6 5 Kyle "Heuh, the commercials! 
"
6 5 Kyle "Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
"
6 5 Kyle "Get it back to normal, Chef!
"
6 5 Kyle "The TV left.
"
6 5 Kyle "We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
"
6 5 Kyle "We're not too late! 
"
6 5 Kyle "They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
"
6 5 Kyle "Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
"
6 5 Kyle "That'd disgusting, dude!
"
6 5 Kyle "It's okay, it's still the show.
"
6 5 Kyle "Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
"
6 5 Kyle "Will your sister let us watch it?
"
6 5 Kyle "Look! Crack addicts with a television! 
"
6 5 Kyle "Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
"
6 5 Kyle "Well why not?!
"
6 5 Kyle "This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
"
6 5 Kyle "The last commercial break is starting!
"
6 5 Kyle "What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
"
6 5 Kyle "That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
"
6 5 Kyle "They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
"
6 5 Kyle "It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
"
6 6 Kyle "Who wants to tell him?
"
6 6 Kyle "Lame
"
6 6 Kyle "But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
"
6 6 Kyle "We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
"
6 6 Kyle "Phew.
"
6 6 Kyle "Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
"
6 6 Kyle "But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
"
6 6 Kyle "Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
"
6 6 Kyle "Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek.
"
6 6 Kyle "This looks pretty good.
"
6 6 Kyle "You're such a fatass, Cartman!
"
6 6 Kyle "Token.
"
6 6 Kyle "Timmy.
"
6 6 Kyle "Tweek.  Pip
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie.
"
6 6 Kyle "Jimmy.
"
6 6 Kyle "Anything that'll impress us, Token.
"
6 6 Kyle "Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
"
6 6 Kyle "Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"
6 6 Kyle "Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
"
6 6 Kyle "Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
"
6 6 Kyle "So? You're a smartass!
"
6 6 Kyle "Good point. 
"
6 6 Kyle "Cool.
"
6 7 Kyle "Just stick it on.
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 7 Kyle "Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 7 Kyle "No way.
"
6 7 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
6 7 Kyle "No way.
"
6 7 Kyle "Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Ah, alright.
"
6 7 Kyle "I told you, Cartman.
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"
6 7 Kyle "See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
"
6 7 Kyle "Oh God!
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
"
6 7 Kyle "We don't know who else to talk to.
"
6 7 Kyle "Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
"
6 7 Kyle "There's nothing here! 
"
6 7 Kyle "Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
"
6 7 Kyle "Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Quick. Hide. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Got it!
"
6 7 Kyle "It is?
"
6 7 Kyle "Oh, really?? 
"
6 7 Kyle "I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Whoa. 
"
6 7 Kyle "Whoa.
"
6 7 Kyle "Well what are you gonna do?
"
6 7 Kyle "Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
"
6 7 Kyle "Huh.
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
"
6 7 Kyle "...Yeah. So?
"
6 7 Kyle "Hey! It's Tweek.
"
6 7 Kyle "The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
"
6 7 Kyle "Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
"
6 8 Kyle "Hey dudes.
"
6 8 Kyle "What are you guys doin'?
"
6 8 Kyle "In your butts?
"
6 8 Kyle "Why would he put anything in your butts?
"
6 8 Kyle "Hm. 
"
6 8 Kyle "Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
"
6 8 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 8 Kyle "Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
"
6 8 Kyle "It wouldn't work!
"
6 8 Kyle "I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
"
6 8 Kyle "You're on, fat boy!
"
6 8 Kyle "Well, Cartman?
"
6 8 Kyle "Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
"
6 8 Kyle "No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
"
6 8 Kyle "Get the fuck out of here!
"
6 8 Kyle "What?
"
6 8 Kyle "Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
"
6 8 Kyle "Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
6 8 Kyle "So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
"
6 8 Kyle "It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
"
6 8 Kyle "HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
6 8 Kyle "So?
"
6 8 Kyle "Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
"
6 8 Kyle "You were totally, one hundred percent right.
"
6 8 Kyle "You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
"
6 9 Kyle "No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.
"
6 9 Kyle "Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club
"
6 9 Kyle """Free hat?""
"
6 9 Kyle "Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
"
6 9 Kyle "Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
"
6 9 Kyle "We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
"
6 9 Kyle "What?
"
6 9 Kyle "Yah.
"
6 9 Kyle "You?? Why?
"
6 9 Kyle "Me.
"
6 9 Kyle "Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
"
6 9 Kyle "We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
"
6 9 Kyle "Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
"
6 9 Kyle "Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
"
6 9 Kyle "No. NOO!!
"
6 9 Kyle "Nonono! We need to do this first.
"
6 9 Kyle "We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
"
6 9 Kyle "This looks like the right room.
"
6 9 Kyle "That's it!
"
6 9 Kyle "Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
6 9 Kyle "...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
"
6 9 Kyle "Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
"
6 9 Kyle "It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
"
6 9 Kyle "You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
"
6 9 Kyle "When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
"
6 9 Kyle "Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
"
6 9 Kyle "What??
"
6 9 Kyle "Yup.
"
6 9 Kyle "Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
"
6 9 Kyle "Yeah. I I think so.
"
6 9 Kyle "...What? 
"
6 9 Kyle "Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
"
6 10 Kyle "She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
"
6 10 Kyle "Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
"
6 10 Kyle "I don't know. 
"
6 10 Kyle "Dude! Bebe is really smart!
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah, it's cool.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah. She's really cool. 
"
6 10 Kyle "That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
"
6 10 Kyle "I'm showing her.
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh!
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
"
6 10 Kyle "Hah hah hah!
"
6 10 Kyle "We were throwing rocks at cars.
"
6 10 Kyle "Maybe she's in the lunch line.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yep.
"
6 10 Kyle "Right.
"
6 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
6 10 Kyle "Huh??
"
6 10 Kyle "Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
"
6 10 Kyle "No way! Tweek's cool!
"
6 10 Kyle "I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
"
6 10 Kyle "Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?
"
6 10 Kyle "Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
"
6 10 Kyle "Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
"
6 10 Kyle "But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
"
6 10 Kyle "Boobs are stupid!
"
6 11 Kyle "It will.
"
6 11 Kyle "So?
"
6 11 Kyle "Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
"
6 11 Kyle "But, wait. Where's the other team? 
"
6 11 Kyle "Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
"
6 11 Kyle "You're such a fatass, Cartman.
"
6 11 Kyle "Yeah, it was like four days ago!
"
6 12 Kyle "It was such a long time ago!
"
6 12 Kyle "Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
"
6 12 Kyle "Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6 12 Kyle "We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah. Closure.
"
6 12 Kyle "There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Alright, we made it!
"
6 12 Kyle "Let him out, Cartman! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Is he in there?
"
6 12 Kyle "I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
"
6 12 Kyle "Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
"
6 12 Kyle "A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
"
6 12 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Maybe you got brain cancer.
"
6 12 Kyle "Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
"
6 12 Kyle "Do you see anything?
"
6 12 Kyle "Grandma??
"
6 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
6 12 Kyle "What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
"
6 12 Kyle "Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
"
6 12 Kyle "HAAHH!!! 
"
6 12 Kyle "Hey Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "You're too fat to be Kenny.
"
6 12 Kyle "What?? For God's sake, why??
"
6 12 Kyle "Are you gonna burn me?
"
6 12 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
6 12 Kyle "You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
"
6 12 Kyle "We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!"
6 12 Kyle "Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6 12 Kyle "What do you mean, fatass?
"
6 12 Kyle "Do you see anything?
"
6 12 Kyle "Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
"
6 12 Kyle "Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
"
6 12 Kyle "Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
"
6 12 Kyle "Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
"
6 12 Kyle "Stop him, Kenny! 
"
6 13 Kyle "That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
"
6 13 Kyle "But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
"
6 13 Kyle "Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"
6 13 Kyle "I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
"
6 13 Kyle "Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
"
6 13 Kyle "Gentlemen, we are off! 
"
6 13 Kyle "The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
"
6 13 Kyle "Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
"
6 13 Kyle "Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
"
6 13 Kyle "This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
"
6 13 Kyle "You can't keep it.
"
6 13 Kyle "Dude, that video is making people act strange.
"
6 13 Kyle "We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
"
6 13 Kyle "Hide! 
"
6 13 Kyle "Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
"
6 13 Kyle "Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
"
6 13 Kyle "We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
"
6 13 Kyle "This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
"
6 13 Kyle "Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
"
6 13 Kyle "Paladin!
"
6 13 Kyle "We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
"
6 13 Kyle "We were almost killed.
"
6 13 Kyle "Hey, what are you guys doing? 
"
6 13 Kyle "You guys. Somebody is following us.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters?
"
6 13 Kyle "Jimmy, are you sure?
"
6 13 Kyle "They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
"
6 13 Kyle "Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh brother!
"
6 13 Kyle "No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
"
6 13 Kyle "Oh no! They're closed!
"
6 13 Kyle "Finally.  It's over.
"
6 13 Kyle "Butters! No!
"
6 13 Kyle "It has to go back!
"
6 13 Kyle "Let go of the tape, Butters!
"
6 13 Kyle "Fine! 
"
6 13 Kyle "Middle-earth is again safe.
"
6 14 Kyle "Funny.
"
6 14 Kyle "Not him!
"
6 14 Kyle "Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"
6 14 Kyle "Hey guys, can we talk to you? 
"
6 14 Kyle "Uhh, not cool.
"
6 14 Kyle "Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
"
6 14 Kyle """Fat tits."" That's a good one.
"
6 14 Kyle "Bad.
"
6 14 Kyle "Gays, I guess.
"
6 14 Kyle "Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
"
6 14 Kyle "We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
"
6 14 Kyle "Uh, a bear?
"
6 14 Kyle "Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
"
6 14 Kyle "Aaaa! 
"
6 14 Kyle "People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
"
6 14 Kyle "Oh.
"
6 14 Kyle "Can't... glue... any... more. 
"
6 15 Kyle "Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
"
6 15 Kyle "Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
"
6 15 Kyle "Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
"
6 15 Kyle "We're gong to New York?
"
6 15 Kyle "Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
"
6 15 Kyle "We have a dead friend.
"
6 15 Kyle "Yee-yeah.
"
6 15 Kyle "I'm Kyle.
"
6 15 Kyle "Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?
"
6 15 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
6 15 Kyle "Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
"
6 15 Kyle "Four white birds!
"
6 15 Kyle "There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
"
6 15 Kyle "So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
"
6 15 Kyle "I'm not going back.
"
6 15 Kyle "I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
"
6 15 Kyle "Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
"
6 15 Kyle "He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
"
6 15 Kyle "You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
"
6 15 Kyle "You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
"
6 16 Kyle "Throw it away, Clyde!
"
6 16 Kyle "Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
"
6 16 Kyle "What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
"
6 16 Kyle "...Where did you have sex with her?
"
6 16 Kyle "Wow. That's pretty cool.
"
6 16 Kyle "'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
"
6 16 Kyle "Hey, what happens to me in the future?
"
6 17 Kyle "What are you doing, Cartman?
"
6 17 Kyle "What's it?
"
6 17 Kyle "That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
"
6 17 Kyle "Mr. Hankey! 
"
6 17 Kyle "Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
"
6 17 Kyle "But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
"
6 17 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
6 17 Kyle "Me neither.
"
6 17 Kyle "Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
"
6 17 Kyle "Finally!
"
6 17 Kyle "Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
"
6 17 Kyle "Wow, cool!
"
6 17 Kyle "Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
"
6 17 Kyle "Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
"
6 17 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
6 17 Kyle "Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
"
6 17 Kyle "All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
"
6 17 Kyle "We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"
6 17 Kyle "Jesus, behind you! 
"
6 17 Kyle "You bastards. 
"
6 17 Kyle "On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
"
6 17 Kyle "Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
"
6 17 Kyle "Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"
6 17 Kyle "Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
"
6 17 Kyle "Dude, where have you been?
"
6 17 Kyle "Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
"
