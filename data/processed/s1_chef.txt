1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
"
1 1 Chef "Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
"
1 1 Chef "That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
"
1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "How are you doing?
"
1 1 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--
"
1 1 Chef "--get those juices flowin'--
"
1 1 Chef "--we're makin' love gravy--
"
1 1 Chef "--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!
"
1 1 Chef "Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
"
1 1 Chef "What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
"
1 1 Chef "It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
"
1 1 Chef "It's no joke, children, this is big!
"
1 1 Chef "Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
"
1 1 Chef "Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!
"
1 1 Chef "Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
"
1 1 Chef "Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
"
1 1 Chef "Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
"
1 2 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 2 Chef "How are my little crackers today?
"
1 2 Chef "Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
"
1 2 Chef "Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
"
1 2 Chef "Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
"
1 2 Chef "Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
"
1 2 Chef "Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.
"
1 2 Chef "Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.
"
1 2 Chef "How 'bout you and me-
"
1 2 Chef "-get together and make... sweet... love?
"
1 2 Chef "Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
"
1 2 Chef "He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
"
1 2 Chef "Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
"
1 3 Chef "But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
"
1 3 Chef "Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
"
1 3 Chef "Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
"
1 3 Chef "That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
"
1 3 Chef "Oh no, look.
"
1 3 Chef "That's Scuzzlebutt.
"
1 3 Chef "Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
"
1 4 Chef "But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, what is it?
"
1 4 Chef "I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, I'm afraid it does.
"
1 4 Chef "Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the damn ball! 
"
1 4 Chef "Huh? Oh fine, fine.
"
1 4 Chef "Elementary school alumni?
"
1 4 Chef "I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
"
1 4 Chef "Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
"
1 4 Chef "Great pass Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
"
1 4 Chef "Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it, ever so gently.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
"
1 4 Chef "That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
"
1 4 Chef "Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you're gay aren't you?
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you sure do act like it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oohh, come on Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, I'm sorry!
"
1 4 Chef "You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
"
1 4 Chef "It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter?
"
1 4 Chef "Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the ball.
"
1 4 Chef "Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.
"
1 4 Chef "Where the hell have you been Stan?!
"
1 4 Chef "Just get in there boy!
"
1 5 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 5 Chef "How you doin'?
"
1 5 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 5 Chef "Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
"
1 5 Chef "Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
"
1 5 Chef "Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.
"
1 5 Chef "Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
"
1 5 Chef "Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
"
1 5 Chef "Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
"
1 5 Chef "Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
"
1 5 Chef "Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
"
1 5 Chef "Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
"
1 5 Chef "Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
"
1 5 Chef "Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
"
1 5 Chef "Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
"
1 5 Chef "Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
"
1 5 Chef "Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
"
1 5 Chef "Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
"
1 5 Chef "Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
"
1 6 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 6 Chef "How's it goin'?
"
1 6 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 6 Chef "You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.
"
1 6 Chef "No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
"
1 6 Chef "I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
"
1 7 Chef "Hello children.
"
1 7 Chef "What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
"
1 7 Chef "Hello, children.
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
"
1 7 Chef "Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 
"
1 7 Chef "Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor!
"
1 7 Chef "No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
"
1 7 Chef "Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaaaaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Mayor, we've got a big problem. 
"
1 7 Chef "Actually, uh-
"
1 7 Chef "I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
"
1 7 Chef "No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
"
1 7 Chef "Aw, the hell with you both! 
"
1 7 Chef "Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 
"
1 7 Chef "Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
"
1 7 Chef "Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
"
1 7 Chef "I'm working on it children. 
"
1 7 Chef "The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
"
1 7 Chef "Just look for anything suspicious.
"
1 7 Chef "You better let me take that Kyle. 
"
1 7 Chef "I gotta call this hotline number children.
"
1 7 Chef "Look out children! 
"
1 7 Chef "I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.
"
1 7 Chef "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
1 7 Chef "You did it children!
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
"
1 8 Chef "Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
"
1 8 Chef "Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
"
1 8 Chef "What does it mean?
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
"
1 8 Chef "It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
"
1 8 Chef "What the-?!
"
1 8 Chef "Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
"
1 8 Chef "No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
"
1 8 Chef "Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
"
1 8 Chef "Stay close children. 
"
1 8 Chef "We've saved Thanksgiving!
"
1 8 Chef "Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
1 9 Chef "I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
"
1 9 Chef "Say, where's Kyle?
"
1 9 Chef "What? Why?
"
1 9 Chef "Chirstmas poo?  You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Chef "Well!  You can believe in him now. 
"
1 9 Chef "Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Chef "I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.
"
1 10 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 10 Chef "How's it going?
"
1 10 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 
"
1 10 Chef "We've got to do something, children! 
"
1 10 Chef "Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
"
1 10 Chef "Ooh crap.
"
1 10 Chef "Oh ooh. 
"
1 10 Chef "Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
"
1 10 Chef "Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
"
1 10 Chef "Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
"
1 10 Chef "I know, but the fight is starting.
"
1 10 Chef "Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
"
1 10 Chef "Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
"
1 10 Chef "Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
"
1 11 Chef "Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
"
1 11 Chef "Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
"
1 11 Chef "Thaat's right!
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
"
1 11 Chef "Oh, hello.
"
1 11 Chef "I'm Chef.
"
1 11 Chef "I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
"
1 11 Chef "Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
"
1 11 Chef "Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
"
1 11 Chef "If we can have dinner tonight.
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 11 Chef "Not too good.
"
1 11 Chef "No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
"
1 11 Chef "You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
"
1 11 Chef "Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
"
1 11 Chef "Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
"
1 12 Chef "Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...
"
1 12 Chef "Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
"
1 12 Chef "Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
"
1 12 Chef "No. Not since 'Yentl.
"
1 12 Chef "Too late for what?
"
1 12 Chef "Why do you care?
"
1 12 Chef "I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.
"
1 12 Chef "Come on, man. What is this all about?
"
1 12 Chef "Hmmm. 
"
1 12 Chef "Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
"
1 12 Chef "Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
"
1 12 Chef "It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
"
1 12 Chef "Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
"
1 12 Chef "Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
"
1 12 Chef "Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!
"
1 12 Chef "And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
"
1 12 Chef "Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
"
1 12 Chef "Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
"
1 12 Chef "There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
"
1 12 Chef "Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?
"
1 12 Chef "Where?
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, fudge!
"
1 12 Chef "Children!
"
1 12 Chef "I can't - break these - locks!
"
1 12 Chef "Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
"
1 12 Chef "This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
"
1 12 Chef "Look out, children!
"
1 12 Chef "Sidney Poitier?
"
1 12 Chef "Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
"
1 12 Chef "Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
"
1 12 Chef "Is that really necessary?
"
1 12 Chef "It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
"
1 12 Chef "We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
"
1 12 Chef "Who are you?
"
1 12 Chef "You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
"
1 12 Chef "Hey! Where's he goin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Nawh. I'm new in town.
"
1 13 Chef "I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
"
1 13 Chef "Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
"
1 13 Chef "Hello?
"
1 13 Chef "Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Get in here! 
"
1 13 Chef "Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
"
1 13 Chef "Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, ""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
"
1 13 Chef "Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 
"
1 13 Chef "Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
"
1 13 Chef "Yeah! When two women are involved. 
"
1 13 Chef "And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
"
1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
"
1 1 Chef "Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
"
1 1 Chef "That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
"
1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "How are you doing?
"
1 1 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire

1 1 Chef "--get those juices flowin'--

1 1 Chef "--we're makin' love gravy--
"
1 1 Chef "--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!
"
1 1 Chef "Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
"
1 1 Chef "What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
"
1 1 Chef "It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
"
1 1 Chef "It's no joke, children, this is big!
"
1 1 Chef "Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
"
1 1 Chef "Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!
"
1 1 Chef "Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
"
1 1 Chef "Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
"
1 1 Chef "Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
"
1 2 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 2 Chef "How are my little crackers today?
"
1 2 Chef "Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
"
1 2 Chef "Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
"
1 2 Chef "Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
"
1 2 Chef "Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
"
1 2 Chef "Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.
"
1 2 Chef "Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.
"
1 2 Chef "How 'bout you and me-
"
1 2 Chef "-get together and make... sweet... love?
"
1 2 Chef "Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
"
1 2 Chef "He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
"
1 2 Chef "Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
"
1 3 Chef "But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
"
1 3 Chef "Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
"
1 3 Chef "Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
"
1 3 Chef "That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
"
1 3 Chef "Oh no, look.
"
1 3 Chef "That's Scuzzlebutt.
"
1 3 Chef "Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
"
1 4 Chef "But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, what is it?
"
1 4 Chef "I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, I'm afraid it does.
"
1 4 Chef "Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the damn ball! 
"
1 4 Chef "Huh? Oh fine, fine.
"
1 4 Chef "Elementary school alumni?
"
1 4 Chef "I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
"
1 4 Chef "Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
"
1 4 Chef "Great pass Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
"
1 4 Chef "Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it, ever so gently.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
"
1 4 Chef "That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
"
1 4 Chef "Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you're gay aren't you?
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you sure do act like it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oohh, come on Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, I'm sorry!
"
1 4 Chef "You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
"
1 4 Chef "It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter?
"
1 4 Chef "Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the ball.
"
1 4 Chef "Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.
"
1 4 Chef "Where the hell have you been Stan?!
"
1 4 Chef "Just get in there boy!
"
1 5 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 5 Chef "How you doin'?
"
1 5 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 5 Chef "Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
"
1 5 Chef "Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
"
1 5 Chef "Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.
"
1 5 Chef "Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
"
1 5 Chef "Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
"
1 5 Chef "Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
"
1 5 Chef "Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
"
1 5 Chef "Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
"
1 5 Chef "Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
"
1 5 Chef "Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
"
1 5 Chef "Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
"
1 5 Chef "Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
"
1 5 Chef "Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
"
1 5 Chef "Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
"
1 5 Chef "Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
"
1 5 Chef "Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
"
1 6 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 6 Chef "How's it goin'?
"
1 6 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 6 Chef "You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.
"
1 6 Chef "No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
"
1 6 Chef "I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
"
1 7 Chef "Hello children.
"
1 7 Chef "What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
"
1 7 Chef "Hello, children.
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
"
1 7 Chef "Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 
"
1 7 Chef "Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor!
"
1 7 Chef "No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
"
1 7 Chef "Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaaaaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Mayor, we've got a big problem. 
"
1 7 Chef "Actually, uh-
"
1 7 Chef "I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
"
1 7 Chef "No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
"
1 7 Chef "Aw, the hell with you both! 
"
1 7 Chef "Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 
"
1 7 Chef "Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
"
1 7 Chef "Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
"
1 7 Chef "I'm working on it children. 
"
1 7 Chef "The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
"
1 7 Chef "Just look for anything suspicious.
"
1 7 Chef "You better let me take that Kyle. 
"
1 7 Chef "I gotta call this hotline number children.
"
1 7 Chef "Look out children! 
"
1 7 Chef "I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.
"
1 7 Chef "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
1 7 Chef "You did it children!
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
"
1 8 Chef "Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
"
1 8 Chef "Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
"
1 8 Chef "What does it mean?
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
"
1 8 Chef "It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
"
1 8 Chef "What the-?!
"
1 8 Chef "Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
"
1 8 Chef "No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
"
1 8 Chef "Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
"
1 8 Chef "Stay close children. 
"
1 8 Chef "We've saved Thanksgiving!
"
1 8 Chef "Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
1 9 Chef "I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
"
1 9 Chef "Say, where's Kyle?
"
1 9 Chef "What? Why?
"
1 9 Chef "Chirstmas poo?  You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Chef "Well!  You can believe in him now. 
"
1 9 Chef "Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Chef "I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.
"
1 10 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 10 Chef "How's it going?
"
1 10 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 
"
1 10 Chef "We've got to do something, children! 
"
1 10 Chef "Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
"
1 10 Chef "Ooh crap.
"
1 10 Chef "Oh ooh. 
"
1 10 Chef "Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
"
1 10 Chef "Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
"
1 10 Chef "Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
"
1 10 Chef "I know, but the fight is starting.
"
1 10 Chef "Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
"
1 10 Chef "Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
"
1 10 Chef "Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
"
1 11 Chef "Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
"
1 11 Chef "Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
"
1 11 Chef "Thaat's right!
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
"
1 11 Chef "Oh, hello.
"
1 11 Chef "I'm Chef.
"
1 11 Chef "I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
"
1 11 Chef "Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
"
1 11 Chef "Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
"
1 11 Chef "If we can have dinner tonight.
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 11 Chef "Not too good.
"
1 11 Chef "No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
"
1 11 Chef "You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
"
1 11 Chef "Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
"
1 11 Chef "Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
"
1 12 Chef "Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...
"
1 12 Chef "Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
"
1 12 Chef "Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
"
1 12 Chef "No. Not since 'Yentl.
"
1 12 Chef "Too late for what?
"
1 12 Chef "Why do you care?
"
1 12 Chef "I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.
"
1 12 Chef "Come on, man. What is this all about?
"
1 12 Chef "Hmmm. 
"
1 12 Chef "Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
"
1 12 Chef "Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
"
1 12 Chef "It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
"
1 12 Chef "Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
"
1 12 Chef "Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
"
1 12 Chef "Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!
"
1 12 Chef "And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
"
1 12 Chef "Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
"
1 12 Chef "Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
"
1 12 Chef "There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
"
1 12 Chef "Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?
"
1 12 Chef "Where?
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, fudge!
"
1 12 Chef "Children!
"
1 12 Chef "I can't - break these - locks!
"
1 12 Chef "Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
"
1 12 Chef "This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
"
1 12 Chef "Look out, children!
"
1 12 Chef "Sidney Poitier?
"
1 12 Chef "Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
"
1 12 Chef "Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
"
1 12 Chef "Is that really necessary?
"
1 12 Chef "It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
"
1 12 Chef "We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
"
1 12 Chef "Who are you?
"
1 12 Chef "You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
"
1 12 Chef "Hey! Where's he goin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Nawh. I'm new in town.
"
1 13 Chef "I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
"
1 13 Chef "Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
"
1 13 Chef "Hello?
"
1 13 Chef "Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Get in here! 
"
1 13 Chef "Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
"
1 13 Chef "Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, ""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
"
1 13 Chef "Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 
"
1 13 Chef "Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
"
1 13 Chef "Yeah! When two women are involved. 
"
1 13 Chef "And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
"
1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
"
1 1 Chef "Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
"
1 1 Chef "That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
"
1 1 Chef "Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
"
1 1 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 1 Chef "How are you doing?
"
1 1 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--
"
1 1 Chef "--get those juices flowin'--
"
1 1 Chef "--we're makin' love gravy--
"
1 1 Chef "--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!
"
1 1 Chef "Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
"
1 1 Chef "What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
"
1 1 Chef "It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
"
1 1 Chef "It's no joke, children, this is big!
"
1 1 Chef "Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
"
1 1 Chef "Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!
"
1 1 Chef "Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
"
1 1 Chef "Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
"
1 1 Chef "Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!
"
1 1 Chef "Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
"
1 2 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 2 Chef "How are my little crackers today?
"
1 2 Chef "Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
"
1 2 Chef "Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
"
1 2 Chef "Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
"
1 2 Chef "Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 
"
1 2 Chef "Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.
"
1 2 Chef "Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.
"
1 2 Chef "How 'bout you and me-
"
1 2 Chef "-get together and make... sweet... love?
"
1 2 Chef "Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
"
1 2 Chef "He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
"
1 2 Chef "Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
"
1 3 Chef "But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
"
1 3 Chef "Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
"
1 3 Chef "Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
"
1 3 Chef "That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
"
1 3 Chef "Oh no, look.
"
1 3 Chef "That's Scuzzlebutt.
"
1 3 Chef "Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
"
1 4 Chef "But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. 
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, what is it?
"
1 4 Chef "I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
"
1 4 Chef "Yes Pip, I'm afraid it does.
"
1 4 Chef "Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the damn ball! 
"
1 4 Chef "Huh? Oh fine, fine.
"
1 4 Chef "Elementary school alumni?
"
1 4 Chef "I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
"
1 4 Chef "Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
"
1 4 Chef "Great pass Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
"
1 4 Chef "Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it, ever so gently.
"
1 4 Chef "Spank it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
"
1 4 Chef "That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
"
1 4 Chef "Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you're gay aren't you?
"
1 4 Chef "Well, you sure do act like it.
"
1 4 Chef "Oohh, come on Stan.
"
1 4 Chef "No Pip, I'm sorry!
"
1 4 Chef "You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
"
1 4 Chef "It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
"
1 4 Chef "What's the matter?
"
1 4 Chef "Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
"
1 4 Chef "Hike the ball.
"
1 4 Chef "Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.
"
1 4 Chef "Where the hell have you been Stan?!
"
1 4 Chef "Just get in there boy!
"
1 5 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 5 Chef "How you doin'?
"
1 5 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 5 Chef "Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
"
1 5 Chef "Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
"
1 5 Chef "Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.
"
1 5 Chef "Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
"
1 5 Chef "Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
"
1 5 Chef "Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
"
1 5 Chef "Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
"
1 5 Chef "Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
"
1 5 Chef "Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
"
1 5 Chef "Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
"
1 5 Chef "Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
"
1 5 Chef "Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt. 
"
1 5 Chef "Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
"
1 5 Chef "Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
"
1 5 Chef "Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
"
1 5 Chef "Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
"
1 6 Chef "Hello there children.
"
1 6 Chef "How's it goin'?
"
1 6 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 6 Chef "You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.
"
1 6 Chef "No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
"
1 6 Chef "I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
"
1 7 Chef "Hello children.
"
1 7 Chef "What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
"
1 7 Chef "Hello, children.
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
"
1 7 Chef "Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! 
"
1 7 Chef "Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor!
"
1 7 Chef "No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
"
1 7 Chef "Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! 
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. 
"
1 7 Chef "Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
"
1 7 Chef "Aaaaaaaaaah! 
"
1 7 Chef "Mayor, we've got a big problem. 
"
1 7 Chef "Actually, uh-
"
1 7 Chef "I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
"
1 7 Chef "No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
"
1 7 Chef "Aw, the hell with you both! 
"
1 7 Chef "Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
"
1 7 Chef "Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
"
1 7 Chef "Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
"
1 7 Chef "Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! 
"
1 7 Chef "Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
"
1 7 Chef "Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
"
1 7 Chef "I'm working on it children. 
"
1 7 Chef "The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
"
1 7 Chef "Just look for anything suspicious.
"
1 7 Chef "You better let me take that Kyle. 
"
1 7 Chef "I gotta call this hotline number children.
"
1 7 Chef "Look out children! 
"
1 7 Chef "I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.
"
1 7 Chef "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
1 7 Chef "You did it children!
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
"
1 8 Chef "Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
"
1 8 Chef "Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
"
1 8 Chef "What does it mean?
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
"
1 8 Chef "It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
"
1 8 Chef "What the-?!
"
1 8 Chef "Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
"
1 8 Chef "No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
"
1 8 Chef "Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
"
1 8 Chef "Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
"
1 8 Chef "Stay close children. 
"
1 8 Chef "We've saved Thanksgiving!
"
1 8 Chef "Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
"
1 8 Chef "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
1 9 Chef "I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
"
1 9 Chef "Say, where's Kyle?
"
1 9 Chef "What? Why?
"
1 9 Chef "Chirstmas poo?  You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Chef "Well!  You can believe in him now. 
"
1 9 Chef "Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Chef "I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other.
"
1 10 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 10 Chef "How's it going?
"
1 10 Chef "Why bad?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 
"
1 10 Chef "We've got to do something, children! 
"
1 10 Chef "Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
"
1 10 Chef "Ooh crap.
"
1 10 Chef "Oh ooh. 
"
1 10 Chef "Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
"
1 10 Chef "Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
"
1 10 Chef "Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
"
1 10 Chef "Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
"
1 10 Chef "I know, but the fight is starting.
"
1 10 Chef "Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
"
1 10 Chef "Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
"
1 10 Chef "Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
"
1 11 Chef "Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
"
1 11 Chef "Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
"
1 11 Chef "Thaat's right!
"
1 11 Chef "That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... 
"
1 11 Chef "Oh, hello.
"
1 11 Chef "I'm Chef.
"
1 11 Chef "I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
"
1 11 Chef "Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
"
1 11 Chef "Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
"
1 11 Chef "If we can have dinner tonight.
"
1 11 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
1 11 Chef "Not too good.
"
1 11 Chef "No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
"
1 11 Chef "You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
"
1 11 Chef "Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
"
1 11 Chef "Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
"
1 12 Chef "Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...
"
1 12 Chef "Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
"
1 12 Chef "Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
"
1 12 Chef "No. Not since 'Yentl.
"
1 12 Chef "Too late for what?
"
1 12 Chef "Why do you care?
"
1 12 Chef "I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.
"
1 12 Chef "Come on, man. What is this all about?
"
1 12 Chef "Hmmm. 
"
1 12 Chef "Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
"
1 12 Chef "Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
"
1 12 Chef "It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
"
1 12 Chef "Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
"
1 12 Chef "Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
"
1 12 Chef "Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
"
1 12 Chef "Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!
"
1 12 Chef "And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
"
1 12 Chef "Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
"
1 12 Chef "Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
"
1 12 Chef "There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
"
1 12 Chef "Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?
"
1 12 Chef "Where?
"
1 12 Chef "Ooh, fudge!
"
1 12 Chef "Children!
"
1 12 Chef "I can't - break these - locks!
"
1 12 Chef "Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
"
1 12 Chef "This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
"
1 12 Chef "Look out, children!
"
1 12 Chef "Sidney Poitier?
"
1 12 Chef "Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
"
1 12 Chef "Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
"
1 12 Chef "Is that really necessary?
"
1 12 Chef "It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
"
1 12 Chef "We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
"
1 12 Chef "Who are you?
"
1 12 Chef "You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
"
1 12 Chef "Hey! Where's he goin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Nawh. I'm new in town.
"
1 13 Chef "I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
"
1 13 Chef "Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
"
1 13 Chef "Hello?
"
1 13 Chef "Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
"
1 13 Chef "Get in here! 
"
1 13 Chef "Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
"
1 13 Chef "Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, ""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
"
1 13 Chef "Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. 
"
1 13 Chef "Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
"
1 13 Chef "Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
"
1 13 Chef "Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
"
1 13 Chef "Yeah! When two women are involved. 
"
1 13 Chef "And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
"
