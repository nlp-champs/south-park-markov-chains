13 1 Butters "Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
13 1 Butters "Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
13 1 Butters "Um, does Kenny like her?
"
13 1 Butters "Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
13 1 Butters "Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13 1 Butters "It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"
13 1 Butters "Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
13 1 Butters "Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
13 1 Butters "Uh, what's that?
"
13 1 Butters "Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
"
13 3 Butters "Hi, Grandma!
"
13 3 Butters "Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
"
13 3 Butters "Well Eric did. 
"
13 3 Butters "Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
"
13 4 Butters "The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
"
13 4 Butters "This is gonna be great!
"
13 4 Butters "Oh boy!
"
13 4 Butters "Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
"
13 4 Butters "They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
"
13 4 Butters "They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
"
13 4 Butters "Robbed us of our innocence... 
"
13 4 Butters "Oh God, oh my God no! 
"
13 4 Butters "Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
"
13 4 Butters "Oh. Hey fellas.
"
13 4 Butters "Aw thanks.
"
13 4 Butters "Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
"
13 4 Butters "My, my picture?
"
13 5 Butters "Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
"
13 5 Butters "Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
"
13 5 Butters "HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
"
13 5 Butters "Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
"
13 5 Butters "Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
"
13 5 Butters "Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
"
13 7 Butters "We can?
"
13 7 Butters "Whoa.
"
13 7 Butters "Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
"
13 7 Butters "Yeah!
"
13 7 Butters "Neato!
"
13 7 Butters "Pirates ho! 
"
13 7 Butters "Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"
13 7 Butters "It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
13 7 Butters "Huh, who, you mean you?
"
13 7 Butters "No, I'm sick of it!
"
13 7 Butters "He's right, lads. To adventure!
"
13 7 Butters "Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
"
13 7 Butters "Uhh,  mahjey burazi?
"
13 7 Butters "Oh. He-he says they're in there. 
"
13 7 Butters "ARRRRRRGH!
"
13 7 Butters "Okay! 
"
13 7 Butters "Have a good day! 
"
13 7 Butters "What's ""port""?!
"
13 7 Butters "One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
"
13 7 Butters "Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
"
13 7 Butters "Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
"
13 7 Butters "And our parents hollered at us!
"
13 7 Butters "So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
"
13 7 Butters "Huh?
"
13 7 Butters "Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
"
13 7 Butters "Yeah, me too.
"
13 7 Butters "Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
"
13 7 Butters "Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
"
13 9 Butters "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
"
13 9 Butters "Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
"
13 9 Butters "Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
"
13 9 Butters "Uugh!
"
13 9 Butters "So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
13 9 Butters "Sellin' kisses?
"
13 9 Butters "You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"
13 9 Butters "Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
"
13 9 Butters "Uh, how come?
"
13 9 Butters "I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"
13 9 Butters "Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
"
13 9 Butters "I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
"
13 9 Butters "So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
"
13 9 Butters "Thank you! 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
"
13 9 Butters "Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
"
13 9 Butters "Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
13 9 Butters "Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
"
13 9 Butters "Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
"
13 9 Butters "We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
13 9 Butters "The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
"
13 9 Butters "Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
"
13 9 Butters "I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
"
13 9 Butters "Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"
13 9 Butters "Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
"
13 9 Butters "I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
"
13 9 Butters "...A pimp. Huh...
"
13 9 Butters "Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
"
13 9 Butters "Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
"
13 9 Butters "Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
"
13 9 Butters "What's the game?
"
13 9 Butters "Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
"
13 9 Butters "I know what you're saying.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
"
13 9 Butters "Hey Dad!
"
13 9 Butters "Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
"
13 9 Butters "I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
"
13 9 Butters "Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
"
13 9 Butters "Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
"
13 9 Butters "Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
"
13 9 Butters "Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
"
13 9 Butters "What?
"
13 9 Butters "Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"
13 9 Butters "Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
"
13 9 Butters "Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
"
13 9 Butters "All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
"
13 9 Butters "Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
"
13 9 Butters "Sure, Kyle.
"
13 9 Butters "Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"
13 9 Butters "What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
"
13 9 Butters "And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
"
13 9 Butters "REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
"
13 9 Butters "Mmmwhoa boy!
"
13 9 Butters "And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
"
13 9 Butters "It's a kissing company.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
13 9 Butters "'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
"
13 9 Butters "Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
"
13 9 Butters "In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
13 9 Butters "Huh? Why?
"
13 9 Butters "But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
"
13 9 Butters "Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
"
13 9 Butters "Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
"
13 9 Butters "Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
13 9 Butters "What's that?
"
13 9 Butters "Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
"
13 9 Butters "Wha? Awww.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
"
13 9 Butters "Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
13 10 Butters "Yes! Yehhehehes!
"
13 10 Butters "Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
"
13 10 Butters "Let's do this!
"
13 10 Butters "Triceratops!
"
13 10 Butters "I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"
13 10 Butters "Okey doke.
"
13 10 Butters "Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
"
13 10 Butters "Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
"
13 10 Butters "Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"
13 10 Butters "That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
"
13 10 Butters "Yeah!
"
13 10 Butters "No way!
"
13 10 Butters "I'm freaking out...
"
13 10 Butters "Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
13 10 Butters "No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
"
13 10 Butters "There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
"
13 10 Butters "Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
13 10 Butters "Are you sure?
"
13 10 Butters "He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
"
13 11 Butters "Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"
13 11 Butters "Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
"
13 11 Butters "I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
"
13 12 Butters "What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"
13 12 Butters "I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
"
13 12 Butters "It does?
"
13 12 Butters "Okay. 
"
13 12 Butters "That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
13 12 Butters "I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
"
13 13 Butters "Oh jeez!
"
13 13 Butters "Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
"
13 13 Butters "That you hate Smurfs?
"
13 13 Butters "Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
"
13 13 Butters "It is true!
"
13 13 Butters "What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"
13 13 Butters "Hey Eric!
"
13 13 Butters "Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
"
13 13 Butters "Cool, thanks.
"
13 13 Butters "Oh, okay. 
"
13 13 Butters "Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
"
13 13 Butters "Whoa... 
"
13 13 Butters "That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
13 13 Butters "We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
"
13 13 Butters "I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
"
13 13 Butters "Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
13 13 Butters "We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 
"
13 13 Butters "I am.
"
13 13 Butters "The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
"
13 13 Butters "Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"
13 13 Butters "Ohhh, he's got her now!
"
13 13 Butters "She's speechless!
"
13 13 Butters "All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
13 14 Butters "What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"
13 14 Butters "Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
"
13 14 Butters "Okay, thanks. 
"
13 14 Butters "You said ""go ahead"".
"
13 14 Butters "Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
"
13 14 Butters "You bet!
"
13 14 Butters "The who?
"
13 14 Butters "Whoopie! 
"
13 14 Butters "Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
"
13 14 Butters "Come on, Kyle!
"
13 14 Butters "Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
"
13 14 Butters "Do you need to wash your hands?
"
13 14 Butters "You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
"
13 14 Butters "Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
"
13 14 Butters "Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
"
13 14 Butters "You can do it, Kyle!
"
13 14 Butters "Hey look! 
"
13 14 Butters "Hawww, you lived?
"
13 14 Butters "What's this?
"
13 1 Butters "Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
13 1 Butters "Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
13 1 Butters "Um, does Kenny like her?
"
13 1 Butters "Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
13 1 Butters "Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

"
13 1 Butters "Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
13 1 Butters "Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
13 1 Butters "Uh, what's that?
"
13 1 Butters "Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
"
13 3 Butters "Hi, Grandma!
"
13 3 Butters "Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
"
13 3 Butters "Well Eric did.

13 5 Butters "Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
"
13 5 Butters "HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
"
13 5 Butters "Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
"
13 5 Butters "Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
"
13 5 Butters "Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
"
13 7 Butters "We can?
"
13 7 Butters "Whoa.
"
13 7 Butters "Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck!

13 7 Butters "Neato!
"
13 7 Butters "Pirates ho! 
"
13 7 Butters "Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"
13 7 Butters "It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
13 7 Butters "Huh, who, you mean you?
"
13 7 Butters "No, I'm sick of it!
"
13 7 Butters "He's right, lads. To adventure!

13 7 Butters "Oh. He-he says they're in there.

13 7 Butters "Have a good day! 
"
13 7 Butters "What's ""port""?!
"
13 7 Butters "One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
"
13 7 Butters "Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
"
13 7 Butters "Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
"
13 7 Butters "And our parents hollered at us!
"
13 7 Butters "So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
"
13 7 Butters "Huh?
"
13 7 Butters "Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
"
13 7 Butters "Yeah, me too.
"
13 7 Butters "Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
"
13 7 Butters "Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
"
13 9 Butters "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
"
13 9 Butters "Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
"
13 9 Butters "Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
"
13 9 Butters "Uugh!
"
13 9 Butters "So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
13 9 Butters "Sellin' kisses?
"
13 9 Butters "You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"
13 9 Butters "Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
"
13 9 Butters "Uh, how come?
"
13 9 Butters "I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"
13 9 Butters "Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
"
13 9 Butters "I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
"
13 9 Butters "So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
"
13 9 Butters "Thank you! 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
"
13 9 Butters "Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
"
13 9 Butters "Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
13 9 Butters "Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
"
13 9 Butters "Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
"
13 9 Butters "We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
13 9 Butters "The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
"
13 9 Butters "Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
"
13 9 Butters "I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
"
13 9 Butters "Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"
13 9 Butters "Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
"
13 9 Butters "I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
"
13 9 Butters "...A pimp. Huh...
"
13 9 Butters "Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
"
13 9 Butters "Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
"
13 9 Butters "Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
"
13 9 Butters "What's the game?
"
13 9 Butters "Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
"
13 9 Butters "I know what you're saying.
"
13 9 Butters "Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
"
13 9 Butters "Hey Dad!
"
13 9 Butters "Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
"
13 9 Butters "I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
"
13 9 Butters "Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
"
13 9 Butters "Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
"
13 9 Butters "Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
"
13 9 Butters "Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
"
13 9 Butters "What?
"
13 9 Butters "Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"
13 9 Butters "Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
"
13 9 Butters "Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
"
13 9 Butters "All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
"
13 9 Butters "Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
"
13 9 Butters "Sure, Kyle.
"
13 9 Butters "Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"
13 9 Butters "What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
"
13 9 Butters "And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
"
13 9 Butters "REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
"
13 9 Butters "Mmmwhoa boy!
"
13 9 Butters "And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
"
13 9 Butters "It's a kissing company.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
13 9 Butters "'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
"
13 9 Butters "Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
"
13 9 Butters "In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
13 9 Butters "Huh? Why?
"
13 9 Butters "But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
"
13 9 Butters "Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
"
13 9 Butters "Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
"
13 9 Butters "Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
"
13 9 Butters "Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
13 9 Butters "What's that?
"
13 9 Butters "Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
"
13 9 Butters "Wha? Awww.
"
13 9 Butters "Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
"
13 9 Butters "Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
13 10 Butters "Yes! Yehhehehes!
"
13 10 Butters "Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
"
13 10 Butters "Let's do this!
"
13 10 Butters "Triceratops!
"
13 10 Butters "I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"
13 10 Butters "Okey doke.
"
13 10 Butters "Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
"
13 10 Butters "Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
"
13 10 Butters "Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"
13 10 Butters "That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
"
13 10 Butters "Yeah!
"
13 10 Butters "No way!
"
13 10 Butters "I'm freaking out...
"
13 10 Butters "Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
13 10 Butters "No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
"
13 10 Butters "There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
"
13 10 Butters "Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
13 10 Butters "Are you sure?
"
13 10 Butters "He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
"
13 11 Butters "Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"
13 11 Butters "Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
"
13 11 Butters "I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
"
13 12 Butters "What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"
13 12 Butters "I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
"
13 12 Butters "It does?
"
13 12 Butters "Okay. 
"
13 12 Butters "That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
13 12 Butters "I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
"
13 13 Butters "Oh jeez!
"
13 13 Butters "Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
"
13 13 Butters "That you hate Smurfs?
"
13 13 Butters "Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
"
13 13 Butters "It is true!
"
13 13 Butters "What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"
13 13 Butters "Hey Eric!
"
13 13 Butters "Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
"
13 13 Butters "Cool, thanks.
"
13 13 Butters "Oh, okay. 
"
13 13 Butters "Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
"
13 13 Butters "Whoa... 
"
13 13 Butters "That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
13 13 Butters "We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
"
13 13 Butters "I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
"
13 13 Butters "Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
13 13 Butters "We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 
"
13 13 Butters "I am.
"
13 13 Butters "The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
"
13 13 Butters "Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"
13 13 Butters "Ohhh, he's got her now!
"
13 13 Butters "She's speechless!
"
13 13 Butters "All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
13 14 Butters "What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"
13 14 Butters "Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
"
13 14 Butters "Okay, thanks. 
"
13 14 Butters "You said ""go ahead"".
"
13 14 Butters "Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
"
13 14 Butters "You bet!
"
13 14 Butters "The who?
"
13 14 Butters "Whoopie! 
"
13 14 Butters "Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
"
13 14 Butters "Come on, Kyle!
"
13 14 Butters "Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
"
13 14 Butters "Do you need to wash your hands?
"
13 14 Butters "You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
"
13 14 Butters "Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
"
13 14 Butters "Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
"
13 14 Butters "You can do it, Kyle!
"
13 14 Butters "Hey look! 
"
13 14 Butters "Hawww, you lived?
"
13 14 Butters "What's this?
"
