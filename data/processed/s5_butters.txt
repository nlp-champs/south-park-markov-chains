Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
"
5 14 Butters "Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
"
5 14 Butters "It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
"
5 14 Butters "Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
"
5 14 Butters "Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
"
5 14 Butters "That's me.
"
5 14 Butters "That's me.
"
5 14 Butters "Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .
"
5 14 Butters "Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
"
5 14 Butters "Yes sir! 
"
5 14 Butters "We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
"
5 14 Butters "Dad's a good shopper all right.
"
5 14 Butters "You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
"
5 14 Butters "Sure I do!
"
5 14 Butters "Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, that's me!
"
5 14 Butters "Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
"
5 14 Butters """White Swallow Bath House""
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, that's me!
"
5 14 Butters "I'm back, Ma!
"
5 14 Butters "I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
"
5 14 Butters "Well first, he went to see a movie.
"
5 14 Butters "I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
"
5 14 Butters """Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8.
"
5 14 Butters "Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
"
5 14 Butters "To the gym.
"
5 14 Butters "Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
"
5 14 Butters "Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
"
5 14 Butters "Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, that's me!
"
5 14 Butters "Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
"
5 14 Butters "Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
"
5 14 Butters "Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
"
5 14 Butters "That's me!
"
5 14 Butters "One please.
"
5 14 Butters "Uh thanks! 
"
5 14 Butters "Dad?  Dad, you in here?
"
5 14 Butters "Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, Mr. Garrison?
"
5 14 Butters "Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
"
5 14 Butters "Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
"
5 14 Butters "Hi Dad! 
"
5 14 Butters "I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
"
5 14 Butters "Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
"
5 14 Butters "That's me!
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, hey Dad.
"
5 14 Butters "Well, sure thing, Dad.
"
5 14 Butters "Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
"
5 14 Butters "Little white lies?
"
5 14 Butters "...Uh, who's Jack?
"
5 14 Butters "Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
"
5 14 Butters "Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
"
5 14 Butters "A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
"
5 14 Butters "Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
"
5 14 Butters "Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
"
5 14 Butters "Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
"
5 14 Butters "Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
"
5 14 Butters "Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
"
5 14 Butters "Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
"
5 14 Butters "Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
"
5 14 Butters "That's me!
"
5 14 Butters "Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
"
5 14 Butters "That's me!
"
5 14 Butters "That's me!
"
5 14 Butters "And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' ""you took my rubber bands."" Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
"
5 14 Butters "Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''

5 14 Butters "Oh.  Alright, then. I-
"
5 14 Butters "Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-

5 14 Butters "I ain't grounded, am I?
"
5 14 Butters "Lie?
"
5 14 Butters "Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
"
5 14 Butters "Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
"
5 14 Butters "Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
"
5 14 Butters "Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
"
5 14 Butters "...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?

5 14 Butters "Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
"
5 14 Butters "Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
"
5 14 Butters "I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
"
5 14 Butters "Naw, I'm lyin'
"
5 14 Butters "Wuh comin', Dad!

5 14 Butters "I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
"
5 14 Butters """Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8.
"
5 14 Butters "Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
"
5 14 Butters "To the gym.
"
5 14 Butters "Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
"
5 14 Butters "Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
"
5 14 Butters "Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?
"
5 14 Butters "Uh, that's me!

"
5 14 Butters "Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.

Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.

5 14 Butters "I ain't grounded, am I?
"

"
5 14 Butters "Naw, I'm lyin'
