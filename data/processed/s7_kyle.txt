7 1 Kyle "Ah, damn it!
"
7 1 Kyle "My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
"
7 1 Kyle "No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
"
7 1 Kyle "Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
"
7 1 Kyle "Kick it!
"
7 1 Kyle "Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7 1 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
7 1 Kyle "Totally!
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
"
7 1 Kyle "Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
"
7 1 Kyle "You don't?
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
"
7 1 Kyle "And then you said
"
7 1 Kyle "Weird
"
7 1 Kyle "Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"
7 1 Kyle "What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
"
7 1 Kyle "What a dick!
"
7 1 Kyle "Other than his monstrous size.
"
7 1 Kyle "And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
"
7 1 Kyle "Are you okay?
"
7 1 Kyle "No way!  You do it, Kenny!
"
7 1 Kyle "I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
"
7 1 Kyle "God-damnit Cartman!
"
7 1 Kyle "Stop it Cartman!
"
7 1 Kyle "God Dammit!
"
7 1 Kyle "That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
"
7 1 Kyle "No!
"
7 1 Kyle "You're lying!
"
7 1 Kyle "That does it! CHARGE! 
"
7 1 Kyle "It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
"
7 1 Kyle "We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
"
7 1 Kyle "Candy bars?
"
7 1 Kyle "Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
"
7 1 Kyle "The aliens are chasing us! 
"
7 1 Kyle "I think we ditched them.
"
7 1 Kyle "What the? Where are, where are we?
"
7 1 Kyle "It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah.
"
7 1 Kyle "Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
"
7 1 Kyle "No! 
"
7 1 Kyle "Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
"
7 1 Kyle "Earth?
"
7 1 Kyle "You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
"
7 1 Kyle "What?? Who cancelled us?
"
7 1 Kyle "Dude, we have to try!
"
7 1 Kyle "Mighty powerful network executives,
"
7 1 Kyle "Please don't cancel us. Please.
"
7 1 Kyle "Oh my God, this is great!
"
7 1 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
7 1 Kyle "The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
"
7 1 Kyle "And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
"
7 1 Kyle "Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7 1 Kyle "What the hell is that?
"
7 2 Kyle "Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
"
7 2 Kyle "Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
"
7 2 Kyle "What?
"
7 2 Kyle "Cartman, just stay out of it.
"
7 2 Kyle "Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
"
7 2 Kyle "Mee tooo.
"
7 3 Kyle "A reindeer?
"
7 3 Kyle "How dare she talk to us like that?!
"
7 3 Kyle "TP her house?
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh.
"
7 3 Kyle "Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
"
7 3 Kyle "You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh.  Uuugh.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
"
7 3 Kyle "So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
"
7 3 Kyle "We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
"
7 3 Kyle "What have we done? 
"
7 3 Kyle "We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
"
7 3 Kyle "How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
"
7 3 Kyle "Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7 3 Kyle "Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh God!
"
7 3 Kyle "How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
"
7 3 Kyle "I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
"
7 3 Kyle "Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
"
7 3 Kyle "Why are they doing us one at a time?
"
7 3 Kyle "I can get a better deal?
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
"
7 3 Kyle "I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh. Okay. Thanks.
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
"
7 3 Kyle "What's this all about, Cartman?
"
7 3 Kyle "A boat ride?
"
7 3 Kyle "Well, okay.
"
7 3 Kyle "Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
"
7 3 Kyle "I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
7 3 Kyle "Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
"
7 3 Kyle "They did?
"
7 3 Kyle "Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
"
7 3 Kyle "You con-fessed?
"
7 3 Kyle "You guys, we can't let him do this!
"
7 3 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
"
7 3 Kyle "Because it was-
"
7 3 Kyle "I still feel bad, Cartman
"
7 3 Kyle "Yeah. That makes it even worse.
"
7 3 Kyle "I know.
"
7 3 Kyle "We feel bad for other people.
"
7 3 Kyle "You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
"
7 3 Kyle "We have to confess that we were the ones that-
"
7 3 Kyle "Cartman??
"
7 3 Kyle "That's not fair!
"
7 3 Kyle "But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
"
7 3 Kyle "This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
"
7 3 Kyle "Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh Jesus! 
"
7 3 Kyle "You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
"
7 4 Kyle "What should we do?
"
7 4 Kyle "Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
"
7 4 Kyle "Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
"
7 4 Kyle "Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
"
7 4 Kyle "Shut up and study!
"
7 4 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
7 4 Kyle "That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
7 4 Kyle "No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman?  Cartman??
"
7 4 Kyle "Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
"
7 4 Kyle "But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
"
7 4 Kyle "Oh, Jesus...
"
7 4 Kyle "God damnit!
"
7 4 Kyle "Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
"
7 4 Kyle "We didn't do our homework.
"
7 4 Kyle "He does?
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
"
7 4 Kyle "I-I don't know.
"
7 4 Kyle "I hate this town. I-I really really do.
"
7 5 Kyle "...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cool.
"
7 5 Kyle "No way.
"
7 5 Kyle "It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
"
7 5 Kyle "No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop it!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
"
7 5 Kyle "Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "God dammit! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
"
7 5 Kyle "That's not what I meant!
"
7 5 Kyle "Can we go now, please?!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop it, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "...What?
"
7 5 Kyle "No!
"
7 5 Kyle "Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
"
7 5 Kyle "Good.
"
7 5 Kyle "Aw, God-dammit!
"
7 5 Kyle "That does it. I'm out. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
"
7 5 Kyle "I hate you. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Come in.  COME IN!! 
"
7 5 Kyle "So stop doing it!
"
7 5 Kyle "You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
"
7 5 Kyle "Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
"
7 5 Kyle "I can see your lips moving!
"
7 5 Kyle "See?! I just saw your lips move!
"
7 5 Kyle "Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
"
7 5 Kyle "Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""
"
7 5 Kyle "YES, dude! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Out! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Oh Jesus.
"
7 5 Kyle "Oh no, no, nonono.
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop. It.
"
7 5 Kyle "Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
"
7 5 Kyle "All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
"
7 6 Kyle "Awww, shit!
"
7 6 Kyle "Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
"
7 6 Kyle "Really?
"
7 6 Kyle "Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
"
7 6 Kyle "I think we can piece this case together now.
"
7 6 Kyle "Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
"
7 6 Kyle "Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
"
7 6 Kyle "Then saw off the arms and legs. 
"
7 6 Kyle "But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
"
7 6 Kyle "We're in business!
"
7 6 Kyle "Do you kow where your doll is?
"
7 6 Kyle "All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
"
7 6 Kyle "But the window isn't locked.
"
7 6 Kyle "Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
"
7 6 Kyle "Yeah, but how?
"
7 6 Kyle "How... do you make semen come out?
"
7 6 Kyle "Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
"
7 6 Kyle "What?  What??
"
7 6 Kyle "They've got the doll! 
"
7 6 Kyle "What do we do now?
"
7 6 Kyle "Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
"
7 6 Kyle "We've got to do something.
"
7 6 Kyle "...Grrrr!!! 
"
7 6 Kyle "But they said we can't charge the front door.
"
7 6 Kyle "We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
"
7 6 Kyle "Wow! 
"
7 6 Kyle "Ah... a a a meth lab?
"
7 6 Kyle "What is a meth lab, anyway?
"
7 6 Kyle "Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 
"
7 6 Kyle "We're sorry.
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
"
7 6 Kyle "Better how, dude?
"
7 6 Kyle "We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
"
7 6 Kyle "No. 
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
"
7 6 Kyle "Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
"
7 6 Kyle "Certainly.
"
7 6 Kyle "That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
"
7 7 Kyle "What is Native American comedy, anyway?
"
7 7 Kyle "Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
"
7 7 Kyle "I said I wanna leave.
"
7 7 Kyle "What?? No, no, I mean, I-
"
7 7 Kyle "Native Americans. 
"
7 7 Kyle "Dog parade?
"
7 7 Kyle "How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
"
7 7 Kyle "The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
"
7 7 Kyle "What the hell are they doing??
"
7 7 Kyle "You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
"
7 7 Kyle "Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
"
7 7 Kyle "What?! Get the hell out of here!
"
7 8 Kyle "Hey dudes. 
"
7 8 Kyle "What?
"
7 8 Kyle "Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
"
7 8 Kyle "Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
"
7 8 Kyle "Thanks.
"
7 8 Kyle "Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
"
7 8 Kyle "I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
"
7 8 Kyle "Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
"
7 8 Kyle "Stan? 
"
7 8 Kyle "No! Ah!
"
7 8 Kyle "I got beat up at school... for being different.
"
7 8 Kyle "No! For not being a metrosexual.
"
7 8 Kyle "Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
"
7 8 Kyle "Gah! Just leave me alone! 
"
7 8 Kyle "GRRRRR!!
"
7 8 Kyle "That does it! I know what I have to do! 
"
7 8 Kyle "One ticket to New York, please.
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
"
7 8 Kyle "Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
"
7 8 Kyle "Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
"
7 8 Kyle "I thought of it first!
"
7 8 Kyle "Did so! Did so!
"
7 8 Kyle "I thought of it two days ago!
"
7 8 Kyle "Cool.
"
7 8 Kyle "Clear!
"
7 8 Kyle "They aren't gay? Then what are they?
"
7 8 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
7 8 Kyle "You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
"
7 8 Kyle "No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
"
7 8 Kyle "Mom!
"
7 8 Kyle "What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"
7 8 Kyle "...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
"
7 8 Kyle "God-damnit!
"
7 9 Kyle "He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
"
7 9 Kyle "I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
"
7 9 Kyle "Christian rock?!
"
7 9 Kyle "That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7 9 Kyle "Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
"
7 9 Kyle "You're on, fat boy!
"
7 9 Kyle "What a stupid asshole!
"
7 9 Kyle "Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
"
7 9 Kyle "Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
"
7 9 Kyle "Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
"
7 9 Kyle "Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
"
7 9 Kyle "Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
"
7 9 Kyle "Aaaargh! 
"
7 9 Kyle "It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
"
7 9 Kyle "Really?
"
7 9 Kyle "All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
"
7 9 Kyle "Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't know.  Let me go check. 
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't know!
"
7 9 Kyle "Um, sir-
"
7 9 Kyle "We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
"
7 9 Kyle "What's the matter with him?
"
7 9 Kyle "We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
"
7 9 Kyle "So, he's gonna get it, right?
"
7 9 Kyle "No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
"
7 9 Kyle "Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
"
7 9 Kyle "We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
"
7 9 Kyle "You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
"
7 9 Kyle "You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
"
7 9 Kyle "Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
"
7 9 Kyle "Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
"
7 9 Kyle "You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
"
7 9 Kyle "I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
"
7 9 Kyle "That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""
"
7 9 Kyle """We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
"
7 9 Kyle "He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
"
7 9 Kyle "Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
"
7 9 Kyle "From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
"
7 9 Kyle "Oh.
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
"
7 9 Kyle "Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
"
7 9 Kyle "This is the worst day of my life.
"
7 9 Kyle "Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
"
7 10 Kyle "You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
"
7 10 Kyle "It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
"
7 10 Kyle "Dude, look!
"
7 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
7 10 Kyle "Dude, is that your dad?
"
7 10 Kyle "I can't understand him.
"
7 10 Kyle "Why are they all out driving at the same time?
"
7 10 Kyle "Aah! There's another one!
"
7 10 Kyle "Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
"
7 10 Kyle "They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"
7 10 Kyle "We can't fight them, Cartman.
"
7 10 Kyle "Country Kitchen Buffet?
"
7 10 Kyle "That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7 10 Kyle "Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
7 11 Kyle "You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"
7 11 Kyle "No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
"
7 11 Kyle "It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
"
7 11 Kyle "Who said I'm inviting you? 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
"
7 11 Kyle "Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""
"
7 11 Kyle "You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Sorry, my mind's made up.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
"
7 11 Kyle "That isn't it, Cartman.
"
7 11 Kyle "That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
"
7 11 Kyle "I know you don't. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Well?
"
7 11 Kyle "How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Kyle "Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
"
7 11 Kyle "That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
7 11 Kyle "And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
"
7 11 Kyle "Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh wait. Cartman.
"
7 11 Kyle "Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
"
7 11 Kyle "I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
7 11 Kyle "All right, let's go.
"
7 11 Kyle "Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"
7 11 Kyle "Aw dude, weak.
"
7 11 Kyle "Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
7 11 Kyle "Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, it's pretty cool.
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh, awesome.
"
7 11 Kyle "What?
"
7 11 Kyle "What?
"
7 11 Kyle "I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
"
7 11 Kyle "It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
"
7 11 Kyle "Cartman!
"
7 11 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Jesus Christ! 
"
7 12 Kyle "Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
"
7 12 Kyle "Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
"
7 12 Kyle "Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
"
7 12 Kyle "What are they doing?
"
7 12 Kyle "What happened? 
"
7 12 Kyle "You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
"
7 12 Kyle "Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
"
7 12 Kyle "Wow!
"
7 12 Kyle "Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh no...
"
7 13 Kyle "Dude, this is unbearable.
"
7 13 Kyle "Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
7 13 Kyle "Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
"
7 13 Kyle "D'awww sick! 
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh God... 
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah. This is really their fault.
"
7 13 Kyle "Who's Rob Reiner?
"
7 13 Kyle "You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
"
7 13 Kyle "Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh no...
"
7 13 Kyle "But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
"
7 13 Kyle "What??
"
7 13 Kyle "So, tobacco helped to build America.
"
7 13 Kyle "That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
7 13 Kyle "But dude, you're making stuff up.
"
7 13 Kyle "Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
"
7 13 Kyle "This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
"
7 13 Kyle "Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"
7 13 Kyle "No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"
7 13 Kyle "What are you doing? 
"
7 13 Kyle "Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
"
7 13 Kyle "Who's going to kill you?
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
7 13 Kyle "No dude, get away!
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
"
7 13 Kyle "No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
7 13 Kyle "Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
"
7 13 Kyle "God-damnit! 
"
7 13 Kyle "No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
"
7 13 Kyle "You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
"
7 13 Kyle "No.
"
7 13 Kyle "No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
"
7 14 Kyle "Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
7 14 Kyle "Why?
"
7 14 Kyle "Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
"
7 14 Kyle "God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
"
7 14 Kyle "'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
"
7 14 Kyle "No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
"
7 14 Kyle "Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
"
7 14 Kyle "Dude, not now! 
"
7 14 Kyle "Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
"
7 14 Kyle "No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"
7 14 Kyle "What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
"
7 14 Kyle "Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
"
7 14 Kyle "Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
"
7 14 Kyle "Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
"
7 14 Kyle "Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
"
7 14 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
7 14 Kyle "Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
7 14 Kyle "Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
"
7 14 Kyle "Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
"
7 14 Kyle "Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
"
7 14 Kyle "God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
"
7 14 Kyle "Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
7 14 Kyle "Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
"
7 14 Kyle "Yeah. She is.
"
7 14 Kyle "Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"
7 14 Kyle "Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
"
7 14 Kyle "What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"
7 14 Kyle "Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
7 15 Kyle "No Ike! Shh!
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
"
7 15 Kyle "You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
"
7 15 Kyle "Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
"
7 15 Kyle "It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
7 15 Kyle "Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
"
7 15 Kyle "I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
"
7 15 Kyle "What?
"
7 15 Kyle "Is that true?
"
7 15 Kyle "I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
"
7 15 Kyle "It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
"
7 15 Kyle "We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
"
7 15 Kyle "Four.
"
7 15 Kyle "How about fifty daura?
"
7 15 Kyle "Fifty-five daura.
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay. Sixty daura.
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay.
"
7 15 Kyle "Got it. 
"
7 15 Kyle "Why not?
"
7 15 Kyle "You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
"
7 15 Kyle "All right! We're going to Canada!
"
7 15 Kyle "Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
7 15 Kyle "I'm trying! 
"
7 15 Kyle "No.
"
7 15 Kyle "Hey! We're in Canada!
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
"
7 15 Kyle "Who's that?
"
7 15 Kyle "Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
"
7 15 Kyle "So how do we get to Ottawa?
"
7 15 Kyle "Word!
"
7 15 Kyle "Who are you?
"
7 15 Kyle "That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
"
7 15 Kyle "French Canada?
"
7 15 Kyle "We don't have time for this.
"
7 15 Kyle "Hello?
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay, you can come with us.
"
7 15 Kyle "God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
"
7 15 Kyle "Can we just get going, please?
"
7 15 Kyle "There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
"
7 15 Kyle "Well come on! 
"
7 15 Kyle "Do you think we can still make it in time?
"
7 15 Kyle "We need to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7 15 Kyle "No. No!! 
"
7 15 Kyle "Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
"
7 15 Kyle "Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
"
7 15 Kyle "Really? 
"
7 15 Kyle "Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike!
"
7 15 Kyle "Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
"
7 15 Kyle "But why are you making such strange laws??
"
7 15 Kyle "You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
"
7 15 Kyle "What the hell??
"
7 15 Kyle "Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
"
7 15 Kyle "Dude, come on.
"
7 1 Kyle "Ah, damn it!
"
7 1 Kyle "My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
"
7 1 Kyle "No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
"
7 1 Kyle "Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
"
7 1 Kyle "Kick it!
"
7 1 Kyle "Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7 1 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
7 1 Kyle "Totally!
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
"
7 1 Kyle "Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
"
7 1 Kyle "You don't?
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
"
7 1 Kyle "And then you said
"
7 1 Kyle "Weird
"
7 1 Kyle "Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"
7 1 Kyle "What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
"
7 1 Kyle "What a dick!
"
7 1 Kyle "Other than his monstrous size.
"
7 1 Kyle "And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
"
7 1 Kyle "Are you okay?
"
7 1 Kyle "No way!  You do it, Kenny!
"
7 1 Kyle "I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
"
7 1 Kyle "God-damnit Cartman!
"
7 1 Kyle "Stop it Cartman!
"
7 1 Kyle "God Dammit!
"
7 1 Kyle "That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
"
7 1 Kyle "No!
"
7 1 Kyle "You're lying!
"
7 1 Kyle "That does it! CHARGE! 
"
7 1 Kyle "It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
"
7 1 Kyle "We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
"
7 1 Kyle "Candy bars?
"
7 1 Kyle "Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
"
7 1 Kyle "The aliens are chasing us! 
"
7 1 Kyle "I think we ditched them.
"
7 1 Kyle "What the? Where are, where are we?
"
7 1 Kyle "It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
"
7 1 Kyle "Yeah.
"
7 1 Kyle "Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
"
7 1 Kyle "No! 
"
7 1 Kyle "Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
"
7 1 Kyle "Earth?
"
7 1 Kyle "You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
"
7 1 Kyle "What?? Who cancelled us?
"
7 1 Kyle "Dude, we have to try!
"
7 1 Kyle "Mighty powerful network executives,
"
7 1 Kyle "Please don't cancel us. Please.
"
7 1 Kyle "Oh my God, this is great!
"
7 1 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
7 1 Kyle "The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
"
7 1 Kyle "And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
"
7 1 Kyle "Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7 1 Kyle "What the hell is that?
"
7 2 Kyle "Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
"
7 2 Kyle "Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
"
7 2 Kyle "What?
"
7 2 Kyle "Cartman, just stay out of it.
"
7 2 Kyle "Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
"
7 2 Kyle "Mee tooo.
"
7 3 Kyle "A reindeer?
"
7 3 Kyle "How dare she talk to us like that?!
"
7 3 Kyle "TP her house?
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh.
"
7 3 Kyle "Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
"
7 3 Kyle "You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh.  Uuugh.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
"
7 3 Kyle "So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
"
7 3 Kyle "We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
"
7 3 Kyle "What have we done? 
"
7 3 Kyle "We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
"
7 3 Kyle "How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
"
7 3 Kyle "Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7 3 Kyle "Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh God!
"
7 3 Kyle "How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
"
7 3 Kyle "I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
"
7 3 Kyle "Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
"
7 3 Kyle "Why are they doing us one at a time?
"
7 3 Kyle "I can get a better deal?
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
"
7 3 Kyle "I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh. Okay. Thanks.
"
7 3 Kyle "Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
"
7 3 Kyle "What's this all about, Cartman?
"
7 3 Kyle "A boat ride?
"
7 3 Kyle "Well, okay.
"
7 3 Kyle "Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
"
7 3 Kyle "I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
7 3 Kyle "Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
"
7 3 Kyle "They did?
"
7 3 Kyle "Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
"
7 3 Kyle "You con-fessed?
"
7 3 Kyle "You guys, we can't let him do this!
"
7 3 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
"
7 3 Kyle "Because it was-
"
7 3 Kyle "I still feel bad, Cartman
"
7 3 Kyle "Yeah. That makes it even worse.
"
7 3 Kyle "I know.
"
7 3 Kyle "We feel bad for other people.
"
7 3 Kyle "You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
"
7 3 Kyle "Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
"
7 3 Kyle "We have to confess that we were the ones that-
"
7 3 Kyle "Cartman??
"
7 3 Kyle "That's not fair!
"
7 3 Kyle "But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
"
7 3 Kyle "This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
"
7 3 Kyle "Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh Jesus! 
"
7 3 Kyle "You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
"
7 3 Kyle "Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
"
7 4 Kyle "What should we do?
"
7 4 Kyle "Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
"
7 4 Kyle "Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
"
7 4 Kyle "Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
"
7 4 Kyle "Shut up and study!
"
7 4 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
7 4 Kyle "That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
7 4 Kyle "No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman?  Cartman??
"
7 4 Kyle "Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
"
7 4 Kyle "But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
"
7 4 Kyle "Oh, Jesus...
"
7 4 Kyle "God damnit!
"
7 4 Kyle "Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
"
7 4 Kyle "We didn't do our homework.
"
7 4 Kyle "He does?
"
7 4 Kyle "Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
"
7 4 Kyle "I-I don't know.
"
7 4 Kyle "I hate this town. I-I really really do.
"
7 5 Kyle "...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cool.
"
7 5 Kyle "No way.
"
7 5 Kyle "It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
"
7 5 Kyle "No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop it!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
"
7 5 Kyle "Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "God dammit! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
"
7 5 Kyle "That's not what I meant!
"
7 5 Kyle "Can we go now, please?!
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop it, Cartman!
"
7 5 Kyle "...What?
"
7 5 Kyle "No!
"
7 5 Kyle "Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
"
7 5 Kyle "Good.
"
7 5 Kyle "Aw, God-dammit!
"
7 5 Kyle "That does it. I'm out. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
"
7 5 Kyle "I hate you. 
"
7 5 Kyle "Come in.  COME IN!! 
"
7 5 Kyle "So stop doing it!
"
7 5 Kyle "You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
"
7 5 Kyle "Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
"
7 5 Kyle "I can see your lips moving!
"
7 5 Kyle "See?! I just saw your lips move!
"
7 5 Kyle "Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
"
7 5 Kyle "Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""
"
7 5 Kyle "YES, dude! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Out! 
"
7 5 Kyle "Oh Jesus.
"
7 5 Kyle "Oh no, no, nonono.
"
7 5 Kyle "Stop. It.
"
7 5 Kyle "Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
"
7 5 Kyle "All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
"
7 6 Kyle "Awww, shit!
"
7 6 Kyle "Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
"
7 6 Kyle "Really?
"
7 6 Kyle "Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
"
7 6 Kyle "I think we can piece this case together now.
"
7 6 Kyle "Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
"
7 6 Kyle "Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
"
7 6 Kyle "Then saw off the arms and legs. 
"
7 6 Kyle "But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
"
7 6 Kyle "We're in business!
"
7 6 Kyle "Do you kow where your doll is?
"
7 6 Kyle "All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
"
7 6 Kyle "But the window isn't locked.
"
7 6 Kyle "Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
"
7 6 Kyle "Yeah, but how?
"
7 6 Kyle "How... do you make semen come out?
"
7 6 Kyle "Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
"
7 6 Kyle "What?  What??
"
7 6 Kyle "They've got the doll! 
"
7 6 Kyle "What do we do now?
"
7 6 Kyle "Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
"
7 6 Kyle "We've got to do something.
"
7 6 Kyle "...Grrrr!!! 
"
7 6 Kyle "But they said we can't charge the front door.
"
7 6 Kyle "We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
"
7 6 Kyle "Wow! 
"
7 6 Kyle "Ah... a a a meth lab?
"
7 6 Kyle "What is a meth lab, anyway?
"
7 6 Kyle "Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 
"
7 6 Kyle "We're sorry.
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
"
7 6 Kyle "Better how, dude?
"
7 6 Kyle "We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
"
7 6 Kyle "No. 
"
7 6 Kyle "Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
"
7 6 Kyle "Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
"
7 6 Kyle "Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
"
7 6 Kyle "Certainly.
"
7 6 Kyle "That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
"
7 7 Kyle "What is Native American comedy, anyway?
"
7 7 Kyle "Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
"
7 7 Kyle "I said I wanna leave.
"
7 7 Kyle "What?? No, no, I mean, I-
"
7 7 Kyle "Native Americans. 
"
7 7 Kyle "Dog parade?
"
7 7 Kyle "How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
"
7 7 Kyle "The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
"
7 7 Kyle "What the hell are they doing??
"
7 7 Kyle "You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
"
7 7 Kyle "Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
"
7 7 Kyle "What?! Get the hell out of here!
"
7 8 Kyle "Hey dudes. 
"
7 8 Kyle "What?
"
7 8 Kyle "Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
"
7 8 Kyle "Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
"
7 8 Kyle "Thanks.
"
7 8 Kyle "Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
"
7 8 Kyle "I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
"
7 8 Kyle "Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
"
7 8 Kyle "Stan? 
"
7 8 Kyle "No! Ah!
"
7 8 Kyle "I got beat up at school... for being different.
"
7 8 Kyle "No! For not being a metrosexual.
"
7 8 Kyle "Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
"
7 8 Kyle "Gah! Just leave me alone! 
"
7 8 Kyle "GRRRRR!!
"
7 8 Kyle "That does it! I know what I have to do! 
"
7 8 Kyle "One ticket to New York, please.
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
"
7 8 Kyle "Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
"
7 8 Kyle "I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
"
7 8 Kyle "Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
"
7 8 Kyle "I thought of it first!
"
7 8 Kyle "Did so! Did so!
"
7 8 Kyle "I thought of it two days ago!
"
7 8 Kyle "Cool.
"
7 8 Kyle "Clear!
"
7 8 Kyle "They aren't gay? Then what are they?
"
7 8 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
7 8 Kyle "You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
"
7 8 Kyle "No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
"
7 8 Kyle "Mom!
"
7 8 Kyle "What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"
7 8 Kyle "...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
"
7 8 Kyle "God-damnit!
"
7 9 Kyle "He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
"
7 9 Kyle "I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
"
7 9 Kyle "Christian rock?!
"
7 9 Kyle "That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7 9 Kyle "Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
"
7 9 Kyle "You're on, fat boy!
"
7 9 Kyle "What a stupid asshole!
"
7 9 Kyle "Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
"
7 9 Kyle "Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
"
7 9 Kyle "Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
"
7 9 Kyle "Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
"
7 9 Kyle "Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
"
7 9 Kyle "Aaaargh! 
"
7 9 Kyle "It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
"
7 9 Kyle "Really?
"
7 9 Kyle "All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
"
7 9 Kyle "Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't know.  Let me go check. 
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't know!
"
7 9 Kyle "Um, sir-
"
7 9 Kyle "We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
"
7 9 Kyle "What's the matter with him?
"
7 9 Kyle "We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
"
7 9 Kyle "So, he's gonna get it, right?
"
7 9 Kyle "No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
"
7 9 Kyle "Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
"
7 9 Kyle "We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
"
7 9 Kyle "You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
"
7 9 Kyle "You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
"
7 9 Kyle "Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
"
7 9 Kyle "Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
"
7 9 Kyle "You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
"
7 9 Kyle "I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
"
7 9 Kyle "That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""
"
7 9 Kyle """We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
"
7 9 Kyle "He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
"
7 9 Kyle "Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
"
7 9 Kyle "From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
"
7 9 Kyle "Oh.
"
7 9 Kyle "I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
"
7 9 Kyle "Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
"
7 9 Kyle "This is the worst day of my life.
"
7 9 Kyle "Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
"
7 10 Kyle "You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
"
7 10 Kyle "It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
"
7 10 Kyle "Dude, look!
"
7 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
7 10 Kyle "Dude, is that your dad?
"
7 10 Kyle "I can't understand him.
"
7 10 Kyle "Why are they all out driving at the same time?
"
7 10 Kyle "Aah! There's another one!
"
7 10 Kyle "Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
"
7 10 Kyle "They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"
7 10 Kyle "We can't fight them, Cartman.
"
7 10 Kyle "Country Kitchen Buffet?
"
7 10 Kyle "That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7 10 Kyle "Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
7 11 Kyle "You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"
7 11 Kyle "No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
"
7 11 Kyle "It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
"
7 11 Kyle "Who said I'm inviting you? 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
"
7 11 Kyle "Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""
"
7 11 Kyle "You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Sorry, my mind's made up.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
"
7 11 Kyle "That isn't it, Cartman.
"
7 11 Kyle "That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
"
7 11 Kyle "I know you don't. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Well?
"
7 11 Kyle "How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
7 11 Kyle "I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7 11 Kyle "Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
"
7 11 Kyle "That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
7 11 Kyle "And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
"
7 11 Kyle "Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh wait. Cartman.
"
7 11 Kyle "Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
"
7 11 Kyle "I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
7 11 Kyle "All right, let's go.
"
7 11 Kyle "Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"
7 11 Kyle "Aw dude, weak.
"
7 11 Kyle "Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
7 11 Kyle "Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
"
7 11 Kyle "Yeah, it's pretty cool.
"
7 11 Kyle "Oh, awesome.
"
7 11 Kyle "What?
"
7 11 Kyle "What?
"
7 11 Kyle "I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
"
7 11 Kyle "It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
"
7 11 Kyle "Cartman!
"
7 11 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
7 11 Kyle "Jesus Christ! 
"
7 12 Kyle "Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
"
7 12 Kyle "Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
"
7 12 Kyle "Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
"
7 12 Kyle "What are they doing?
"
7 12 Kyle "What happened? 
"
7 12 Kyle "You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
"
7 12 Kyle "Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
"
7 12 Kyle "Wow!
"
7 12 Kyle "Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh no...
"
7 13 Kyle "Dude, this is unbearable.
"
7 13 Kyle "Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
7 13 Kyle "Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
"
7 13 Kyle "D'awww sick! 
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh God... 
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah. This is really their fault.
"
7 13 Kyle "Who's Rob Reiner?
"
7 13 Kyle "You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
"
7 13 Kyle "Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
"
7 13 Kyle "Oh no...
"
7 13 Kyle "But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
"
7 13 Kyle "What??
"
7 13 Kyle "So, tobacco helped to build America.
"
7 13 Kyle "That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
7 13 Kyle "But dude, you're making stuff up.
"
7 13 Kyle "Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
"
7 13 Kyle "This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
"
7 13 Kyle "Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"
7 13 Kyle "No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"
7 13 Kyle "What are you doing? 
"
7 13 Kyle "Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
"
7 13 Kyle "Who's going to kill you?
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
7 13 Kyle "No dude, get away!
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
"
7 13 Kyle "Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
"
7 13 Kyle "No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
7 13 Kyle "Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
"
7 13 Kyle "God-damnit! 
"
7 13 Kyle "No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
"
7 13 Kyle "You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
"
7 13 Kyle "No.
"
7 13 Kyle "No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
"
7 14 Kyle "Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
7 14 Kyle "Why?
"
7 14 Kyle "Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
"
7 14 Kyle "God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
"
7 14 Kyle "'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
"
7 14 Kyle "No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
"
7 14 Kyle "Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
"
7 14 Kyle "Dude, not now! 
"
7 14 Kyle "Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
"
7 14 Kyle "No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"
7 14 Kyle "What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
"
7 14 Kyle "Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
"
7 14 Kyle "Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
"
7 14 Kyle "Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
"
7 14 Kyle "Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
"
7 14 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
7 14 Kyle "Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
7 14 Kyle "Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
"
7 14 Kyle "Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
"
7 14 Kyle "Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
"
7 14 Kyle "God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
"
7 14 Kyle "Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
7 14 Kyle "Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
"
7 14 Kyle "Yeah. She is.
"
7 14 Kyle "Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"
7 14 Kyle "Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
"
7 14 Kyle "What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"
7 14 Kyle "Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
7 15 Kyle "No Ike! Shh!
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
"
7 15 Kyle "You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
"
7 15 Kyle "Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
"
7 15 Kyle "It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
7 15 Kyle "Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
"
7 15 Kyle "I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
"
7 15 Kyle "What?
"
7 15 Kyle "Is that true?
"
7 15 Kyle "I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
"
7 15 Kyle "It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
"
7 15 Kyle "We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
"
7 15 Kyle "Four.
"
7 15 Kyle "How about fifty daura?
"
7 15 Kyle "Fifty-five daura.
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay. Sixty daura.
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay.
"
7 15 Kyle "Got it. 
"
7 15 Kyle "Why not?
"
7 15 Kyle "You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
"
7 15 Kyle "All right! We're going to Canada!
"
7 15 Kyle "Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
7 15 Kyle "I'm trying! 
"
7 15 Kyle "No.
"
7 15 Kyle "Hey! We're in Canada!
"
7 15 Kyle "Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
"
7 15 Kyle "Who's that?
"
7 15 Kyle "Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
"
7 15 Kyle "So how do we get to Ottawa?
"
7 15 Kyle "Word!
"
7 15 Kyle "Who are you?
"
7 15 Kyle "That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
"
7 15 Kyle "French Canada?
"
7 15 Kyle "We don't have time for this.
"
7 15 Kyle "Hello?
"
7 15 Kyle "Okay, you can come with us.
"
7 15 Kyle "God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
"
7 15 Kyle "Can we just get going, please?
"
7 15 Kyle "There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
"
7 15 Kyle "Well come on! 
"
7 15 Kyle "Do you think we can still make it in time?
"
7 15 Kyle "We need to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7 15 Kyle "No. No!! 
"
7 15 Kyle "Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
"
7 15 Kyle "Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
"
7 15 Kyle "Really? 
"
7 15 Kyle "Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
"
7 15 Kyle "Ike!

7 15 Kyle "Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything.

7 15 Kyle "You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
"
7 15 Kyle "What the hell??
"
7 15 Kyle "Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
"
7 15 Kyle "Dude, come on.
