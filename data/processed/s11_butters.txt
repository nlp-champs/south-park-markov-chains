11 2 Butters "Whoa! Hey Dad! 
"
11 2 Butters "I'm getting a surprise! 
"
11 2 Butters "Hey. Where'd Eric go?
"
11 2 Butters "Like what?
"
11 2 Butters "What's... bi-curious?
"
11 2 Butters "Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 
"
11 2 Butters "...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
"
11 2 Butters "Really?
"
11 2 Butters "Whoa boy! Camp!
"
11 2 Butters "Because I'm bi-curious?
"
11 2 Butters "I'm bi-curious.
"
11 2 Butters "He's bi-curious too?
"
11 2 Butters "Well sure, I guess.
"
11 2 Butters "Well yeah, sure.
"
11 2 Butters "Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"
11 2 Butters "Yes, it's all very confusing!
"
11 2 Butters "...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
"
11 2 Butters "Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
"
11 2 Butters "Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
"
11 2 Butters "Wuh-what's the matter?
"
11 2 Butters "Well I like you too, Bradley.
"
11 2 Butters "Well yeah!

11 2 Butters "I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
"
11 2 Butters "Oh no, my Dad?
"
11 2 Butters "Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
"
11 2 Butters "Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
"
11 2 Butters "You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
"
11 2 Butters "All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"
11 2 Butters "I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
"
11 2 Butters "No. I like bein' bi-curious.
"
11 2 Butters "Wait. Now I am confused.
"
11 3 Butters "Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
"
11 3 Butters "Yeah! Dumb girls!
"
11 3 Butters "Heh hey guys, what would I do?
"
11 3 Butters "Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
"
11 3 Butters "Me too.
"
11 4 Butters "Now you go, Baahir. 
"
11 4 Butters "Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
"
11 4 Butters "Well all right! 
"
11 4 Butters "Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
"
11 4 Butters "Oh hey Eric.
"
11 4 Butters "Hey, I was about to win!
"
11 4 Butters "Awwwww.
"
11 6 Butters "But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
"
11 6 Butters "You have to be careful with scissors.
"
11 7 Butters "Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
"
11 8 Butters "Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
"
11 8 Butters "Uh hey Eric!
"
11 8 Butters "Wuh who are you talking about?
"
11 8 Butters "You... you and your cousin touched wieners?

11 10 Butters "Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
"
11 10 Butters "Wow.
"
11 10 Butters "Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
"
11 10 Butters "Ah, all right then.
"
11 10 Butters "Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
"
11 10 Butters "Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!
"
11 10 Butters "Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
"
11 10 Butters "Hey guys!
"
11 10 Butters "Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
"
11 10 Butters "Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
"
11 10 Butters "Uh what's the Barrier?
"
11 10 Butters "Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
"
11 10 Butters "Waaahaa!
"
11 10 Butters "Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
"
11 10 Butters "Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
"
11 11 Butters "Hold on, fellas!
"
11 11 Butters "Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
"
11 11 Butters "Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
"
11 11 Butters "Huh?
"
11 11 Butters "No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
"
11 11 Butters "Oh hamburgers! 
"
11 11 Butters "WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
"
11 11 Butters "Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
"
11 11 Butters "Really?
"
11 11 Butters "How much further to Castle Sunshine?
"
11 11 Butters "What was that?
"
11 11 Butters "Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
"
11 11 Butters "Wait! Waaait! 
"
11 11 Butters "Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
"
11 11 Butters "I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
"
11 11 Butters "Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
"
11 11 Butters "Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
"
11 11 Butters "But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
"
11 12 Butters "Wuh, what can I do?
"
11 12 Butters "What powers? Ah I don't understand.
"
11 12 Butters "I c-I can?
"
11 12 Butters "How?
"
11 12 Butters "How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
"
11 12 Butters "AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no!

11 12 Butters "GAA HAA!

11 12 Butters "Huwhoa! 
"
11 12 Butters "Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
"
11 12 Butters "Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
"
11 12 Butters "Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
"
11 12 Butters "More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
"
11 12 Butters "Fellas! Where'd you come from? 
"
11 12 Butters "Huh... 
"
11 12 Butters "Well I just... used my imagination.
"
11 12 Butters "A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
"
11 12 Butters "Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
"
11 12 Butters "Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.
"
11 12 Butters "Oh yeah? 
"
11 12 Butters "Ahhh shit.

11 13 Butters "Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
"
11 13 Butters "Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
"
11 13 Butters "They're gonna do it! 
"
11 13 Butters "Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
"
11 14 Butters "Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
"
11 14 Butters "Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
"
11 14 Butters "I donno.
"
11 14 Butters "I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
"
11 14 Butters "You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
"
11 14 Butters "Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
"
11 14 Butters "Neato!
"
11 14 Butters "O-kay!
"
11 14 Butters "They sure don't.
"
11 14 Butters "You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
"
11 14 Butters "Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
"
11 14 Butters "Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
