19 1 Cartman "Sweet dude!
"
19 1 Cartman "I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
"
19 1 Cartman "Tom Brady.
"
19 1 Cartman "Deny and subvert.
"
19 1 Cartman "Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me? Kyle, Stan...
"
19 1 Cartman "A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
"
19 1 Cartman "You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
Boys:	Yeah!
"
19 1 Cartman "I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say ""You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!""
"
19 1 Cartman "NO! No, to hell with that! ""You're giving me NO days suspension! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"" 
"
19 1 Cartman "Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. 
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
"
19 1 Cartman "You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
"
19 1 Cartman "It's just a request, that's all. See you around.  Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal.  What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear.  Why, this is Butters' underwear.
"
19 1 Cartman "PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now...  Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it.  This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capisce?
"
19 1 Cartman "You mean about keeping your dick out?
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
"
19 1 Cartman "Okay, let's back up.  Aaah!
"
19 1 Cartman "No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh God!
"
19 1 Cartman "We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
"
19 1 Cartman "There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
"
19 1 Cartman "No way.
"
19 1 Cartman "Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
"
19 1 Cartman "If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
"
19 1 Cartman "Aaahh, aahh!  Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. 
"
19 1 Cartman "No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
"
19 1 Cartman "No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
"
19 1 Cartman "I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
"
19 1 Cartman "Ack! Butters!
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
"
19 1 Cartman "I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
"
19 1 Cartman "OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk.  How is everybody doing?
"
19 1 Cartman "Who?
"
19 1 Cartman "...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? 
"
19 1 Cartman "I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
"
19 1 Cartman "I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero,  but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
"
19 1 Cartman "All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! 
Pregnant Mexican Women:	Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
"
19 1 Cartman "Fire the taco launchers!  Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! 
"
19 1 Cartman "The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! 
"
19 1 Cartman "All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos.  All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! 
"
19 1 Cartman "There's still too many PC guys on the balcony and- oh.  Oh fuck, there's Kyle.  What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
"
19 1 Cartman "Yes. But at least we him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue.  What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
"
19 1 Cartman "Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude.
"
19 2 Cartman "You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
"
19 2 Cartman "Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
"
19 2 Cartman "And he's sitting right here.
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
"
19 2 Cartman "Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
"
19 2 Cartman "But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, I'm out.
"
19 2 Cartman "Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
"
19 2 Cartman "You know, what's that story about two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
"
19 2 Cartman "Yes, Lion King II?. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
"
19 2 Cartman "Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now?  Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?!  This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
"
19 2 Cartman "What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
"
19 2 Cartman "All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay. Do you just want a race war?
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
"
19 2 Cartman "And start a pride all of our own.
"
19 2 Cartman "Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
"
19 2 Cartman "Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
"
19 2 Cartman "Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters?! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! 
"
19 2 Cartman "Dude!
"
19 3 Cartman "Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
"
19 3 Cartman "No.  Hey, we are not country bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
"
19 3 Cartman "We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! 
"
19 3 Cartman "Are the Mexicans actually staying?
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard.  I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
"
19 4 Cartman "Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
"
19 4 Cartman "Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
"
19 4 Cartman "Great, and can you turn down the music a bit?  This pagan shit hurts my ears.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor.  Busboy!
"
19 4 Cartman "Ehexcuse me?
"
19 4 Cartman "Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?
"
19 4 Cartman "It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up.
"
19 4 Cartman "Mmmhmmm! 
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
"
19 4 Cartman "Here you go. 
"
19 4 Cartman "Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
"
19 4 Cartman "I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
"
19 4 Cartman "EEWW.  What's the busboy doing here?
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school?  Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
"
19 4 Cartman "Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
"
19 4 Cartman "I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
"
19 4 Cartman "It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude.  ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
"
19 4 Cartman "Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
"
19 4 Cartman "Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only  one star late.
"
19 4 Cartman "Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
"
19 4 Cartman "Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
"
19 4 Cartman "What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool.""
"
19 4 Cartman "That's awesome!  I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. 
"
19 4 Cartman "Hm hm hm the fuck?  Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor!  Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David.  Over here, there's some shit on the floor.  Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
"
19 4 Cartman "What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool""
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it.  You'd better start riding a bicicleta to school!  One star! ... No s-no stars?  No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys!  Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's good. That's good. 
"
19 4 Cartman "It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
"
19 4 Cartman "All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
"
19 4 Cartman "I guess.
"
19 4 Cartman "You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
"
19 4 Cartman "Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
"
19 4 Cartman "It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, but they need to be made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! 
"
19 4 Cartman "Fuck!  Mom!
"
19 4 Cartman "But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
"
19 4 Cartman "Mom, there's a fucking billion people here!  Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
"
19 4 Cartman "Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
"
19 4 Cartman "Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic.  It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following  one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
"
19 4 Cartman "So now rise up, and  fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
"
19 4 Cartman "It didn't do well with Yelpers.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
"
19 4 Cartman "Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy's failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
"
19 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word!  And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, hello David! 
"
19 4 Cartman "...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? 
"
19 4 Cartman "Why thank you, David. That's good service.
"
19 4 Cartman "Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce?
"
19 4 Cartman "Hmmm. It's tart, but savory.
"
19 5 Cartman "Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
"
19 5 Cartman "I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids  if he would take a picture of me  and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in ""Don't I look ripped?"" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and 
"
19 5 Cartman "I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time  so you'd probably do a really good job.
"
19 5 Cartman "I'm not a joke!
"
19 5 Cartman "I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
"
19 5 Cartman "There you are. You have my social media comments?
"
19 5 Cartman "Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
"
19 5 Cartman "Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
"
19 5 Cartman "Butters!
"
19 5 Cartman "What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says ""This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!""
"
19 5 Cartman "What new people? 
"
19 5 Cartman "Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
"
19 5 Cartman "Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
"
19 5 Cartman "Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe space.
"
19 5 Cartman "People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe space? 
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows.
"
19 5 Cartman "People that support me.
"
19 5 Cartman "More people that support me.
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows. 
"
19 5 Cartman "What? Who is that?
"
19 5 Cartman "I'll take care of him, Demi! 
"
19 5 Cartman "Our safe spaces will keep you out!
"
19 5 Cartman "But Reality we can do without!
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows.
"
19 5 Cartman "That was nice.
"
19 5 Cartman """Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-""  oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible  Augh.  Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. ""I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-"" Oh God!  Uh, delete! ""You aren't fat, but my dick is-"" Whoa, God.
"
19 5 Cartman "Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
"
19 6 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
19 6 Cartman "Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
"
19 6 Cartman "I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
"
19 6 Cartman "I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
"
19 6 Cartman "Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
"
19 6 Cartman "! That's awesome!! That's so sweet.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
"
19 6 Cartman "Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yep. School tomorrow should be very interesting.
"
19 6 Cartman "You guys! You guys, hurry!
"
19 6 Cartman "It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! 
"
19 6 Cartman "Oh come on, you guys. Get a room. 
"
19 6 Cartman """Can't we just try? Teehee."" Oh man.
"
19 6 Cartman "Someone who needs a real talking to.
"
19 6 Cartman "Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
"
19 6 Cartman "You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
"
19 6 Cartman "I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. 
"
19 6 Cartman "What are you doing? This place isn't you. 
"
19 6 Cartman "No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
"
19 6 Cartman "Fuck you.
"
19 6 Cartman "The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
"
19 6 Cartman "I'm not homosexual!
"
19 6 Cartman "Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
"
19 6 Cartman "Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? 
"
19 6 Cartman "Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
"
19 6 Cartman "It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
"
19 6 Cartman "Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
"
19 6 Cartman "Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!  Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it!  That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. 
"
19 7 Cartman "You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay!  They're totally gay!
"
19 7 Cartman "Kenny and Token.
"
19 7 Cartman "Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
"
19 7 Cartman "No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
"
19 7 Cartman "It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
"
19 7 Cartman "Ah, no, we're good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!
Clyde:	It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, I'm sure they are. 
"
19 7 Cartman "That's pretty cool.
"
19 7 Cartman "Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
"
19 7 Cartman "Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
"
19 7 Cartman "I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yes I do, Butters. 
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
"
19 7 Cartman "That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?!  He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
"
19 7 Cartman "So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
"
19 7 Cartman "And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
"
19 7 Cartman "No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Buttters.
"
19 7 Cartman "Whoa, dude.
"
19 7 Cartman "They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
"
19 7 Cartman "Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
"
19 7 Cartman "Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
"
19 7 Cartman "YES!  YEEES!  Oh--oh, oh--oh! Oh--oh, oh--oh! What did I tell you guys?
"
19 7 Cartman "You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this.  It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja.  Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.
"
19 7 Cartman "Who, who is this?
"
19 7 Cartman "...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, bug Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
"
19 7 Cartman "No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
"
19 7 Cartman "I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
"
19 9 Cartman "Oh my fucking God...
"
19 9 Cartman "I'm so bored, dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "I am not your slave, Kyle.
"
19 9 Cartman "PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
"
19 9 Cartman "Have fun, dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
"
19 9 Cartman "How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
"
19 9 Cartman "How does it do that?
"
19 9 Cartman "That movie's gonna suck dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "Eating ice cream, dipshit.
"
19 9 Cartman "And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. 
"
19 9 Cartman "Didn't we finish doing that?
"
19 9 Cartman "Why isn't anyone looking at me?
"
19 9 Cartman "Stan's calling you a traitor.
"
19 9 Cartman "I am loving this right now.
"
19 9 Cartman "Hoh that's low. 
"
19 9 Cartman "Fight! 
"
19 10 Cartman "What?
"
19 10 Cartman "Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
"
19 10 Cartman "So what do we do now?
"
19 10 Cartman "Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
"
19 10 Cartman "Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
"
19 10 Cartman "Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner.  Do I look sweet, Butters?
"
19 10 Cartman "Yeah, I just want finish this movie.
"
19 10 Cartman "Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax.
"
19 10 Cartman "I will go to bed  when this movie is over, Mom!
"
19 10 Cartman "Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up.
"
19 10 Cartman "I don't think so, Mom.
"
19 10 Cartman "No means no, Bill Cosby!
"
19 10 Cartman "Whoa, Mom, what the hell?
"
19 10 Cartman "Mom, put down the gun.
"
19 10 Cartman "Okay, I am going. 
"
19 10 Cartman "I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. 
"
19 10 Cartman "Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. 
"
19 10 Cartman "That's a nice gun right there.
"
19 10 Cartman "Yes, dude!
"
19 1 Cartman "Sweet dude!
"
19 1 Cartman "I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
"
19 1 Cartman "Tom Brady.
"
19 1 Cartman "Deny and subvert.
"
19 1 Cartman "Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me? Kyle, Stan...
"
19 1 Cartman "A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
"
19 1 Cartman "You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
Boys:	Yeah!
"
19 1 Cartman "I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say ""You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!""
"
19 1 Cartman "NO! No, to hell with that! ""You're giving me NO days suspension! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"" 
"
19 1 Cartman "Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. 
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
"
19 1 Cartman "You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
"
19 1 Cartman "It's just a request, that's all. See you around.  Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal.  What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear.  Why, this is Butters' underwear.
"
19 1 Cartman "PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now...  Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it.  This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capisce?
"
19 1 Cartman "You mean about keeping your dick out?
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
"
19 1 Cartman "Okay, let's back up.  Aaah!
"
19 1 Cartman "No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh God!
"
19 1 Cartman "We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
"
19 1 Cartman "There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
"
19 1 Cartman "No way.
"
19 1 Cartman "Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
"
19 1 Cartman "If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
"
19 1 Cartman "Aaahh, aahh!  Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. 
"
19 1 Cartman "No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
"
19 1 Cartman "No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
"
19 1 Cartman "I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
"
19 1 Cartman "Ack! Butters!
"
19 1 Cartman "Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
"
19 1 Cartman "I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
"
19 1 Cartman "OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk.  How is everybody doing?
"
19 1 Cartman "Who?
"
19 1 Cartman "...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? 
"
19 1 Cartman "I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
"
19 1 Cartman "I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero,  but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
"
19 1 Cartman "All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! 
Pregnant Mexican Women:	Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
"
19 1 Cartman "Fire the taco launchers!  Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! 
"
19 1 Cartman "The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! 
"
19 1 Cartman "All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos.  All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! 
"
19 1 Cartman "There's still too many PC guys on the balcony and- oh.  Oh fuck, there's Kyle.  What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
"
19 1 Cartman "Yes. But at least we him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue.  What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
"
19 1 Cartman "Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude.
"
19 2 Cartman "You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
"
19 2 Cartman "Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
"
19 2 Cartman "And he's sitting right here.
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
"
19 2 Cartman "Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
"
19 2 Cartman "But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, I'm out.
"
19 2 Cartman "Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
"
19 2 Cartman "Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
"
19 2 Cartman "You know, what's that story about two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
"
19 2 Cartman "Yes, Lion King II?. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
"
19 2 Cartman "Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now?  Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?!  This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
"
19 2 Cartman "What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
"
19 2 Cartman "All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay. Do you just want a race war?
"
19 2 Cartman "Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
"
19 2 Cartman "And start a pride all of our own.
"
19 2 Cartman "Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
"
19 2 Cartman "Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
"
19 2 Cartman "Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters?! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! 
"
19 2 Cartman "Dude!
"
19 3 Cartman "Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
"
19 3 Cartman "No.  Hey, we are not country bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
"
19 3 Cartman "We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! 
"
19 3 Cartman "Are the Mexicans actually staying?
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard.  I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
"
19 4 Cartman "Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
"
19 4 Cartman "Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
"
19 4 Cartman "Great, and can you turn down the music a bit?  This pagan shit hurts my ears.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor.  Busboy!
"
19 4 Cartman "Ehexcuse me?
"
19 4 Cartman "Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?
"
19 4 Cartman "It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up.
"
19 4 Cartman "Mmmhmmm! 
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
"
19 4 Cartman "Here you go. 
"
19 4 Cartman "Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
"
19 4 Cartman "I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
"
19 4 Cartman "EEWW.  What's the busboy doing here?
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school?  Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
"
19 4 Cartman "Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
"
19 4 Cartman "I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
"
19 4 Cartman "It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David.
"
19 4 Cartman "David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude.  ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
"
19 4 Cartman "Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
"
19 4 Cartman "Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only  one star late.
"
19 4 Cartman "Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
"
19 4 Cartman "Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
"
19 4 Cartman "What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool.""
"
19 4 Cartman "That's awesome!  I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. 
"
19 4 Cartman "Hm hm hm the fuck?  Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor!  Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David.  Over here, there's some shit on the floor.  Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
"
19 4 Cartman "What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool""
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it.  You'd better start riding a bicicleta to school!  One star! ... No s-no stars?  No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys!  Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's good. That's good. 
"
19 4 Cartman "It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
"
19 4 Cartman "All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
"
19 4 Cartman "I guess.
"
19 4 Cartman "You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
"
19 4 Cartman "Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
"
19 4 Cartman "It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, but they need to be made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! 
"
19 4 Cartman "Fuck!  Mom!
"
19 4 Cartman "But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
"
19 4 Cartman "Mom, there's a fucking billion people here!  Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
"
19 4 Cartman "Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
"
19 4 Cartman "Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic.  It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
"
19 4 Cartman "Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following  one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
"
19 4 Cartman "So now rise up, and  fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
"
19 4 Cartman "It didn't do well with Yelpers.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
"
19 4 Cartman "Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy's failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
"
19 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word!  And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
"
19 4 Cartman "Oh, hello David! 
"
19 4 Cartman "...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? 
"
19 4 Cartman "Why thank you, David. That's good service.
"
19 4 Cartman "Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce?
"
19 4 Cartman "Hmmm. It's tart, but savory.
"
19 5 Cartman "Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
"
19 5 Cartman "I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids  if he would take a picture of me  and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in ""Don't I look ripped?"" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and 
"
19 5 Cartman "I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time  so you'd probably do a really good job.
"
19 5 Cartman "I'm not a joke!
"
19 5 Cartman "I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
"
19 5 Cartman "There you are. You have my social media comments?
"
19 5 Cartman "Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
"
19 5 Cartman "Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
"
19 5 Cartman "Butters!
"
19 5 Cartman "What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says ""This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!""
"
19 5 Cartman "What new people? 
"
19 5 Cartman "Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
"
19 5 Cartman "Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
"
19 5 Cartman "Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe space.
"
19 5 Cartman "People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe space? 
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows.
"
19 5 Cartman "People that support me.
"
19 5 Cartman "More people that support me.
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows. 
"
19 5 Cartman "What? Who is that?
"
19 5 Cartman "I'll take care of him, Demi! 
"
19 5 Cartman "Our safe spaces will keep you out!
"
19 5 Cartman "But Reality we can do without!
"
19 5 Cartman "Bully-proof windows.
"
19 5 Cartman "That was nice.
"
19 5 Cartman """Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-""  oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible  Augh.  Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. ""I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-"" Oh God!  Uh, delete! ""You aren't fat, but my dick is-"" Whoa, God.
"
19 5 Cartman "Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
"
19 6 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
19 6 Cartman "Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
"
19 6 Cartman "I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
"
19 6 Cartman "I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
"
19 6 Cartman "Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
"
19 6 Cartman "! That's awesome!! That's so sweet.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
"
19 6 Cartman "Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
"
19 6 Cartman "Yep. School tomorrow should be very interesting.
"
19 6 Cartman "You guys! You guys, hurry!
"
19 6 Cartman "It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! 
"
19 6 Cartman "Oh come on, you guys. Get a room. 
"
19 6 Cartman """Can't we just try? Teehee."" Oh man.
"
19 6 Cartman "Someone who needs a real talking to.
"
19 6 Cartman "Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
"
19 6 Cartman "You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
"
19 6 Cartman "I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. 
"
19 6 Cartman "What are you doing? This place isn't you. 
"
19 6 Cartman "No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
"
19 6 Cartman "Fuck you.
"
19 6 Cartman "The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
"
19 6 Cartman "I'm not homosexual!
"
19 6 Cartman "Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
"
19 6 Cartman "Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? 
"
19 6 Cartman "Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
"
19 6 Cartman "It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
"
19 6 Cartman "Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
"
19 6 Cartman "Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!  Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it!  That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. 
"
19 7 Cartman "You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay!  They're totally gay!
"
19 7 Cartman "Kenny and Token.
"
19 7 Cartman "Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
"
19 7 Cartman "No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
"
19 7 Cartman "It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
"
19 7 Cartman "Ah, no, we're good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!
Clyde:	It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, I'm sure they are. 
"
19 7 Cartman "That's pretty cool.
"
19 7 Cartman "Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
"
19 7 Cartman "Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
"
19 7 Cartman "I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yes I do, Butters. 
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
"
19 7 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
"
19 7 Cartman "That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?!  He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
"
19 7 Cartman "So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
"
19 7 Cartman "And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
"
19 7 Cartman "No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Buttters.
"
19 7 Cartman "Whoa, dude.
"
19 7 Cartman "They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
"
19 7 Cartman "Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
"
19 7 Cartman "Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
"
19 7 Cartman "YES!  YEEES!  Oh--oh, oh--oh! Oh--oh, oh--oh! What did I tell you guys?
"
19 7 Cartman "You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this.  It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja.  Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.

19 7 Cartman "Who, who is this?
"
19 7 Cartman "...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
"
19 7 Cartman "Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, bug Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
"
19 7 Cartman "No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
"
19 7 Cartman "I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
"
19 9 Cartman "Oh my fucking God...
"
19 9 Cartman "I'm so bored, dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "I am not your slave, Kyle.
"
19 9 Cartman "PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
"
19 9 Cartman "Have fun, dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
"
19 9 Cartman "How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
"
19 9 Cartman "How does it do that?
"
19 9 Cartman "That movie's gonna suck dude.
"
19 9 Cartman "Eating ice cream, dipshit.
"
19 9 Cartman "And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. 
"
19 9 Cartman "Didn't we finish doing that?
"
19 9 Cartman "Why isn't anyone looking at me?
"
19 9 Cartman "Stan's calling you a traitor.

"
19 10 Cartman "Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
