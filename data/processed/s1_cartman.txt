1 1 Cartman "He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 
"
1 1 Cartman "That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
"
1 1 Cartman "Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...
"
1 1 Cartman "What?
"
1 1 Cartman "No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
"
1 1 Cartman "Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.

1 1 Cartman "Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
"
1 1 Cartman "Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger
"
1 1 Cartman "I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.

1 1 Cartman "Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
"
1 1 Cartman "Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
"
1 1 Cartman "Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
"
1 1 Cartman "Ahh, son of a bitch!
"
1 2 Cartman "Heh, I hate those things.
"
1 2 Cartman "Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, ""Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!"" 
"
1 2 Cartman "I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!

"
1 3 Cartman "Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, you would taste my pee!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
"
1 3 Cartman "Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
"
1 3 Cartman "Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
"
1 3 Cartman "Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
"
1 3 Cartman "Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…
"
1 3 Cartman "No! A piece of celery.
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
"
1 3 Cartman "What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, it might be!
"
1 3 Cartman "Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!
"
1 3 Cartman "They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
"
1 3 Cartman "I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
"
1 3 Cartman "Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
"
1 3 Cartman "Holy crap! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you people?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, wait, aah!
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, it's just me.
"
1 3 Cartman "Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, seriously you guys!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey!
"
1 3 Cartman "Goddammit, don't shoot me!
"
1 3 Cartman "I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
"
1 3 Cartman "Help! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
"
1 4 Cartman "Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 
"
1 4 Cartman "I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
"
1 4 Cartman "Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
"
1 4 Cartman "That dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
"
1 4 Cartman "What's homecoming?
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes again.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
"
1 4 Cartman "Ah, dammit!
"
1 4 Cartman "Eeyy!
"
1 4 Cartman "Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an ""A-""?
"
1 4 Cartman "That's not fair!
"
1 4 Cartman "Stupid puppet. 
"
1 4 Cartman "You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
"
1 4 Cartman "Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
"
1 4 Cartman "He still looks pretty gay to me.
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
"
1 4 Cartman "Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!
"
1 4 Cartman "Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!
"
1 4 Cartman "We'll just see about that.
"
1 4 Cartman "No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
"
1 4 Cartman "That's right, you get back there.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
"
1 5 Cartman "Your sister beat you up again, huh?
"
1 5 Cartman "Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
"
1 5 Cartman "I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Be a man Stan.  Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.""
"
1 5 Cartman "That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
"
1 5 Cartman "If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""
"
1 5 Cartman "Yes ma'am.
"
1 5 Cartman "Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
"
1 5 Cartman "You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
"
1 5 Cartman "Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
"
1 5 Cartman "It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
"
1 5 Cartman "I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
1 5 Cartman "Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
"
1 5 Cartman "You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
"
1 5 Cartman "Come on Fluffy! 
"
1 5 Cartman "UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.
"
1 5 Cartman "Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
"
1 5 Cartman "God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
"
1 5 Cartman "Gah, French people piss me off.
"
1 5 Cartman "Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass! 
"
1 5 Cartman "Whaaat?!
"
1 5 Cartman "I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
"
1 5 Cartman "Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"" 
"
1 5 Cartman "I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
"
1 5 Cartman "No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
"
1 5 Cartman "Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
"
1 5 Cartman "Fluffy!
"
1 5 Cartman "Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!
"
1 5 Cartman "I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.
"
1 5 Cartman "Oh yeah, watch me.

1 5 Cartman "That'll do pig.
"
1 6 Cartman "Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!

1 6 Cartman "That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
"
1 6 Cartman "That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
"
1 6 Cartman "Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
"
1 6 Cartman "Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
"
1 6 Cartman "What?
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
"
1 6 Cartman "Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
"
1 6 Cartman "Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
"
1 6 Cartman "Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
"
1 6 Cartman "I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
"
1 6 Cartman "What!
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey!

1 6 Cartman "You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

1 6 Cartman "Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

"
1 7 Cartman "There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
"
1 7 Cartman "You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Wookies don't live on Endor.
"
1 7 Cartman "What?! What did you say?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
"
1 7 Cartman "Eating Kenny's pudding.

1 7 Cartman "Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.

1 7 Cartman "Boo! I'm a ghost.

1 7 Cartman "Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey Chef.

1 7 Cartman "Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?

"
1 8 Cartman "Sweet. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
"
1 8 Cartman "Ahh!
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
"
1 8 Cartman "This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, that's right.
"
1 8 Cartman "No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

"
1 9 Cartman "Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
"
1 9 Cartman "Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
"
1 9 Cartman "Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
"
1 9 Cartman "You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Cartman "Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!

1 9 Cartman "Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
"
1 9 Cartman "How do you know?
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
"
1 9 Cartman "I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
"
1 9 Cartman "Let me see! 
"
1 9 Cartman "Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
"
1 9 Cartman "Thanks to Kyle's mother.
"
1 9 Cartman "How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor.
"
1 9 Cartman "O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll

she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world

"
1 9 Cartman "Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
"
1 9 Cartman "Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,

"
1 9 Cartman "Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!
"
1 9 Cartman "Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
"
1 9 Cartman "'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
"
1 9 Cartman "Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
"
1 9 Cartman "Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah, something feels...unfinished 
"
1 10 Cartman "Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
"
1 10 Cartman "They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
"
1 10 Cartman "Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
"
1 10 Cartman "That's right.
"
1 10 Cartman "That's ri-aayy.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
"
1 10 Cartman "No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeeeeeh!
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
"
1 10 Cartman "Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
"
1 10 Cartman "Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
"
1 10 Cartman "Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
"
1 10 Cartman "Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
"
1 10 Cartman "Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
"
1 10 Cartman "Cartman's birthday!
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
"
1 10 Cartman "Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
"
1 10 Cartman "Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
"
1 10 Cartman "Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
"
1 10 Cartman "I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
"
1 10 Cartman "That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
"
1 11 Cartman "That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...
"
1 11 Cartman "Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow, she's pretty.
"
1 11 Cartman "Yes, ma'am.
"
1 11 Cartman "Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
"
1 11 Cartman "She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
"
1 11 Cartman "Until you puked on her.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
"
1 11 Cartman "Memememememe, me!
"
1 11 Cartman "What's a multiplication table?
"
1 11 Cartman "We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
"
1 11 Cartman "Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
"
1 11 Cartman "Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
"
1 11 Cartman "Nuh-uh!
"
1 11 Cartman "Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
"
1 11 Cartman "Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, hi, Chef.
"
1 11 Cartman "You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
"
1 11 Cartman "I am, too!
"
1 11 Cartman "My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
"
1 11 Cartman "This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Dang! That's nice!
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak, dude!
"
1 11 Cartman "Did you make love?
"
1 11 Cartman "No way!
"
1 11 Cartman "That's not what we just heard!
"
1 11 Cartman "What the hell...? 
"
1 11 Cartman "Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
"
1 12 Cartman "Boooriing.

1 12 Cartman "Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I found it.
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I did, Pip.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
"
1 12 Cartman "Okay, ready? I'll go first. 
"
1 12 Cartman "Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
"
1 12 Cartman "Eeyy! Give me that back!

"
1 12 Cartman "I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
"
1 12 Cartman "Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
"
1 12 Cartman "...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
"
1 12 Cartman "Screw you, triangle thief!
"
1 12 Cartman "Eeyy!
"
1 12 Cartman "Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
"
1 12 Cartman "I was just setting it aside.
"
1 12 Cartman "Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
"
1 12 Cartman "Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
"
1 12 Cartman "Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
"
1 12 Cartman "What's that noise? 
"
1 12 Cartman "Aaah! Aliens! 
"
1 12 Cartman "No! I found it, he stole it!
"
1 12 Cartman "I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
"
1 12 Cartman "Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!

Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...

1 1 Cartman "Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
"
1 1 Cartman "Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
"
1 1 Cartman "Ahh, son of a bitch!
"
1 2 Cartman "Heh, I hate those things.
"
1 2 Cartman "Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, ""Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!""

1 3 Cartman "Hey, you would taste my pee!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
"
1 3 Cartman "Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
"
1 3 Cartman "Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
"
1 3 Cartman "Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
"
1 3 Cartman "Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…
"
1 3 Cartman "No! A piece of celery.
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
"
1 3 Cartman "What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, it might be!
"
1 3 Cartman "Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!
"
1 3 Cartman "They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
"
1 3 Cartman "I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
"
1 3 Cartman "Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
"
1 3 Cartman "Holy crap! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you people?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, wait, aah!
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, it's just me.
"
1 3 Cartman "Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, seriously you guys!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey!
"
1 3 Cartman "Goddammit, don't shoot me!
"
1 3 Cartman "I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
"
1 3 Cartman "Help! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
"
1 4 Cartman "Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 
"
1 4 Cartman "I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
"
1 4 Cartman "Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
"
1 4 Cartman "That dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
"
1 4 Cartman "What's homecoming?
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes again.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
"
1 4 Cartman "Ah, dammit!
"
1 4 Cartman "Eeyy!
"
1 4 Cartman "Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an ""A-""?
"
1 4 Cartman "That's not fair!
"
1 4 Cartman "Stupid puppet. 
"
1 4 Cartman "You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
"
1 4 Cartman "Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
"
1 4 Cartman "He still looks pretty gay to me.
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
"
1 4 Cartman "Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!
"
1 4 Cartman "Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!
"
1 4 Cartman "We'll just see about that.
"
1 4 Cartman "No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
"
1 4 Cartman "That's right, you get back there.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
"
1 5 Cartman "Your sister beat you up again, huh?
"
1 5 Cartman "Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
"
1 5 Cartman "I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Be a man Stan.  Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.""
"
1 5 Cartman "That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
"
1 5 Cartman "If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""
"
1 5 Cartman "Yes ma'am.
"
1 5 Cartman "Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
"
1 5 Cartman "You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
"
1 5 Cartman "Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
"
1 5 Cartman "It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
"
1 5 Cartman "I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
1 5 Cartman "Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
"
1 5 Cartman "You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
"
1 5 Cartman "Come on Fluffy!

1 5 Cartman "Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
"
1 5 Cartman "God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.

1 5 Cartman "Gah, French people piss me off.
"
1 5 Cartman "Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass! 
"
1 5 Cartman "Whaaat?!
"
1 5 Cartman "I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
"
1 5 Cartman "Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"" 
"
1 5 Cartman "I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
"
1 5 Cartman "No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
"
1 5 Cartman "Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
"
1 5 Cartman "Fluffy!

1 5 Cartman "Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!

"
1 6 Cartman "That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
"
1 6 Cartman "Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
"
1 6 Cartman "Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
"
1 6 Cartman "What?
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
"
1 6 Cartman "Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
"
1 6 Cartman "Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
"
1 6 Cartman "Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
"
1 6 Cartman "I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
"
1 6 Cartman "What!
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey!

1 6 Cartman "You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

1 6 Cartman "Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!

1 6 Cartman "Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

1 7 Cartman "Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!

1 7 Cartman "Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.
"
1 7 Cartman "There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
"
1 7 Cartman "You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Wookies don't live on Endor.
"
1 7 Cartman "What?! What did you say?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
"
1 7 Cartman "Eating Kenny's pudding.
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
"
1 7 Cartman "My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!

1 7 Cartman "I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
"
1 7 Cartman "I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
"
1 7 Cartman "Boo! I'm a ghost.
"
1 7 Cartman "Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.

1 7 Cartman "Hey Chef.

"
1 7 Cartman "Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.

1 7 Cartman "Check.
"
1 7 Cartman "Yeah, granola pisses me off. 
"
1 7 Cartman "Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
"
1 7 Cartman "Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
"
1 7 Cartman "Hi Wendy.

1 7 Cartman "You what?! Are you insane?!
"
1 7 Cartman "How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
"
1 7 Cartman "Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
"
1 7 Cartman "You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
"
1 7 Cartman "Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
"
1 7 Cartman "Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
"
1 7 Cartman "Can we have some candy now please?!

1 7 Cartman "I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
"
1 7 Cartman "Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!

1 7 Cartman "It was Kyle.

1 7 Cartman "Remember candy, focus on the candy.
"
1 7 Cartman "Eh, shit...

1 7 Cartman "Kill her Stan!
"
1 7 Cartman "Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
"
1 7 Cartman "Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 
"
1 7 Cartman "Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
"
1 7 Cartman "Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
"
1 7 Cartman "Lehh, eh, screw you guys!

1 8 Cartman "Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.

1 8 Cartman "Yeah, HEY!

1 8 Cartman "You vas-deferens!
"
1 8 Cartman "I get to wear it first, you guys.
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
"
1 8 Cartman "When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
"
1 8 Cartman "Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
"
1 8 Cartman "I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!

"
1 8 Cartman "Sweet. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
"
1 8 Cartman "Ahh!
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
"
1 8 Cartman "This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, that's right.
"
1 8 Cartman "No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

1 8 Cartman "B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.

1 8 Cartman "I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!

1 8 Cartman "Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 
"
1 8 Cartman "Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
"
1 8 Cartman "What?!

1 8 Cartman "WEEEEEEAK!!!

1 9 Cartman "I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
"
1 9 Cartman "What the hell is Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Cartman "Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
"
1 9 Cartman "Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
"
1 9 Cartman "Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
"
1 9 Cartman "You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Cartman "Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!
"
1 9 Cartman "Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
"
1 9 Cartman "How do you know?
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
"
1 9 Cartman "I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
"
1 9 Cartman "Let me see! 
"
1 9 Cartman "Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
"
1 9 Cartman "Thanks to Kyle's mother.
"
1 9 Cartman "How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor.
"
1 9 Cartman "O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
"
1 9 Cartman "Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
"
1 9 Cartman "Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,

1 9 Cartman "Gross, Kyle!
"
1 9 Cartman "YOU SICK BASTARD! 
"
1 9 Cartman "Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!
"
1 9 Cartman "Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
"
1 9 Cartman "'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
"
1 9 Cartman "Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
"
1 9 Cartman "Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah, something feels...unfinished 
"
1 10 Cartman "Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
"
1 10 Cartman "They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
"
1 10 Cartman "Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
"
1 10 Cartman "That's right.
"
1 10 Cartman "That's ri-aayy.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
"
1 10 Cartman "No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeeeeeh!
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
"
1 10 Cartman "Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
"
1 10 Cartman "Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
"
1 10 Cartman "Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
"
1 10 Cartman "Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
"
1 10 Cartman "Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
"
1 10 Cartman "Cartman's birthday!
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
"
1 10 Cartman "Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
"
1 10 Cartman "Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
"
1 10 Cartman "Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
"
1 10 Cartman "I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
"
1 10 Cartman "That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
"
1 11 Cartman "That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...
"
1 11 Cartman "Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow, she's pretty.
"
1 11 Cartman "Yes, ma'am.
"
1 11 Cartman "Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
"
1 11 Cartman "She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
"
1 11 Cartman "Until you puked on her.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
"
1 11 Cartman "Memememememe, me!
"
1 11 Cartman "What's a multiplication table?
"
1 11 Cartman "We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
"
1 11 Cartman "Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
"
1 11 Cartman "Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
"
1 11 Cartman "Nuh-uh!
"
1 11 Cartman "Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
"
1 11 Cartman "Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, hi, Chef.
"
1 11 Cartman "You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
"
1 11 Cartman "I am, too!
"
1 11 Cartman "My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
"
1 11 Cartman "This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Dang! That's nice!
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak, dude!
"
1 11 Cartman "Did you make love?
"
1 11 Cartman "No way!
"
1 11 Cartman "That's not what we just heard!
"
1 11 Cartman "What the hell...? 
"
1 11 Cartman "Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
"
1 12 Cartman "Boooriing. 
"
1 12 Cartman "Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I found it.
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I did, Pip.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
"
1 12 Cartman "Okay, ready? I'll go first. 
"
1 12 Cartman "Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
"
1 12 Cartman "Eeyy! Give me that back!

1 12 Cartman "ANTHROPOLOGIST!
"
1 12 Cartman "I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
"
1 12 Cartman "Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
"
1 12 Cartman "...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
"
1 12 Cartman "Screw you, triangle thief!
"
1 12 Cartman "Eeyy!
"
1 12 Cartman "Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
"
1 12 Cartman "I was just setting it aside.
"
1 12 Cartman "Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
"
1 12 Cartman "Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
"
1 12 Cartman "Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
"
1 12 Cartman "What's that noise? 
"
1 12 Cartman "Aaah! Aliens! 
"
1 12 Cartman "No! I found it, he stole it!
"
1 12 Cartman "I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
"
1 12 Cartman "Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!

1 12 Cartman "You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
"
1 12 Cartman "I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?

1 3 Cartman "Hey, you would taste my pee!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
"
1 3 Cartman "Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
"
1 3 Cartman "Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
"
1 3 Cartman "Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
"
1 3 Cartman "Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…
"
1 3 Cartman "No! A piece of celery.
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
"
1 3 Cartman "What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, it might be!
"
1 3 Cartman "Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!
"
1 3 Cartman "They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
"
1 3 Cartman "I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
"
1 3 Cartman "Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
"
1 3 Cartman "Holy crap! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you people?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, wait, aah!
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, it's just me.
"
1 3 Cartman "Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.
"
1 3 Cartman "You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey, seriously you guys!
"
1 3 Cartman "Hey!
"
1 3 Cartman "Goddammit, don't shoot me!
"
1 3 Cartman "I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
"
1 3 Cartman "Help! 
"
1 3 Cartman "What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
"
1 3 Cartman "Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
"
1 4 Cartman "Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 
"
1 4 Cartman "I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
"
1 4 Cartman "Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
"
1 4 Cartman "That dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
"
1 4 Cartman "What's homecoming?
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes again.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
"
1 4 Cartman "...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
"
1 4 Cartman "Ah, dammit!
"
1 4 Cartman "Eeyy!
"
1 4 Cartman "Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an ""A-""?
"
1 4 Cartman "That's not fair!
"
1 4 Cartman "Stupid puppet. 
"
1 4 Cartman "You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
"
1 4 Cartman "Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
"
1 4 Cartman "Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
"
1 4 Cartman "He still looks pretty gay to me.
"
1 4 Cartman "There he goes.
"
1 4 Cartman "No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
"
1 4 Cartman "Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
"
1 4 Cartman "Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!
"
1 4 Cartman "Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!

1 4 Cartman "We'll just see about that.
"
1 4 Cartman "No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
"
1 4 Cartman "That's right, you get back there.
"
1 4 Cartman "Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
"
1 5 Cartman "Your sister beat you up again, huh?
"
1 5 Cartman "Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
"
1 5 Cartman "I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Be a man Stan.  Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.""
"
1 5 Cartman "That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
"
1 5 Cartman "If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""
"
1 5 Cartman "Yes ma'am.
"
1 5 Cartman "Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
"
1 5 Cartman "You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
"
1 5 Cartman "Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!""
"
1 5 Cartman "Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
"
1 5 Cartman "It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
"
1 5 Cartman "Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
"
1 5 Cartman "I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
1 5 Cartman "Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
"
1 5 Cartman "Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
"
1 5 Cartman "You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
"
1 5 Cartman "Come on Fluffy! 
"
1 5 Cartman "UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.
"
1 5 Cartman "Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
"
1 5 Cartman "God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
"

1 5 Cartman "I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
"
1 5 Cartman "Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
"
1 5 Cartman "Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"" 
"
1 5 Cartman "I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.

1 6 Cartman "That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
"
1 6 Cartman "That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
"
1 6 Cartman "Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
"
1 6 Cartman "Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
"
1 6 Cartman "What?
"
1 6 Cartman "Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
"
1 6 Cartman "Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
"
1 6 Cartman "Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.

"
1 7 Cartman "There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
"
1 7 Cartman "You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Wookies don't live on Endor.
"
1 7 Cartman "What?! What did you say?!
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
"
1 7 Cartman "Eating Kenny's pudding.
"
1 7 Cartman "Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.

"
1 7 Cartman "Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.

"
1 7 Cartman "How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?

1 7 Cartman "Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
"
1 7 Cartman "Can we have some candy now please?!

1 7 Cartman "Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 
"
1 7 Cartman "Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
"
1 7 Cartman "Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
"
1 7 Cartman "Lehh, eh, screw you guys!

1 8 Cartman "I get to wear it first, you guys.
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
"
1 8 Cartman "When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
"
1 8 Cartman "Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
"
1 8 Cartman "I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
"
1 8 Cartman "Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!

"
1 8 Cartman "Sweet. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
"
1 8 Cartman "Ahh!
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
"
1 8 Cartman "This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
"
1 8 Cartman "No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
"
1 8 Cartman "Yeah, that's right.
"
1 8 Cartman "No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
"
1 8 Cartman "Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

1 8 Cartman "I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!

1 8 Cartman "Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 
"
1 8 Cartman "Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
"
1 8 Cartman "What?!

1 9 Cartman "What the hell is Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Cartman "Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
"
1 9 Cartman "Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
"
1 9 Cartman "Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
"
1 9 Cartman "You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Cartman "Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!
"
1 9 Cartman "Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
"
1 9 Cartman "How do you know?
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
"
1 9 Cartman "I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
"
1 9 Cartman "Let me see! 
"
1 9 Cartman "Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
"
1 9 Cartman "Thanks to Kyle's mother.
"
1 9 Cartman "How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor.
"
1 9 Cartman "O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll

she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world

"
1 9 Cartman "Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
"
1 9 Cartman "Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,

1 9 Cartman "YOU SICK BASTARD! 
"
1 9 Cartman "Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!
"
1 9 Cartman "Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
"
1 9 Cartman "'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
"
1 9 Cartman "Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
"
1 9 Cartman "Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
"
1 9 Cartman "Yeah, something feels...unfinished 
"
1 10 Cartman "Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
"
1 10 Cartman "They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
"
1 10 Cartman "Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
"
1 10 Cartman "That's right.
"
1 10 Cartman "That's ri-aayy.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
"
1 10 Cartman "No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeeeeeh!
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
"
1 10 Cartman "Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
"
1 10 Cartman "Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
"
1 10 Cartman "Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
"
1 10 Cartman "Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
"
1 10 Cartman "Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
"
1 10 Cartman "Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
"
1 10 Cartman "Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
"
1 10 Cartman "Cartman's birthday!
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
"
1 10 Cartman "Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
"
1 10 Cartman "Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
"
1 10 Cartman "Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
"
1 10 Cartman "You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
"
1 10 Cartman "Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
"
1 10 Cartman "Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
"
1 10 Cartman "Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
"
1 10 Cartman "Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
"
1 10 Cartman "YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
"
1 10 Cartman "I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
"
1 10 Cartman "That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
"
1 10 Cartman "Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
"
1 11 Cartman "That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...
"
1 11 Cartman "Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow, she's pretty.
"
1 11 Cartman "Yes, ma'am.
"
1 11 Cartman "Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
"
1 11 Cartman "She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
"
1 11 Cartman "Until you puked on her.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
"
1 11 Cartman "Memememememe, me!
"
1 11 Cartman "What's a multiplication table?
"
1 11 Cartman "We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
"
1 11 Cartman "Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
"
1 11 Cartman "Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
"
1 11 Cartman "Nuh-uh!
"
1 11 Cartman "Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
"
1 11 Cartman "Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, hi, Chef.
"
1 11 Cartman "You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
"
1 11 Cartman "I am, too!
"
1 11 Cartman "My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
"
1 11 Cartman "This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
"
1 11 Cartman "I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
"
1 11 Cartman "Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
"
1 11 Cartman "Dang! That's nice!
"
1 11 Cartman "Oh, weak, dude!
"
1 11 Cartman "Did you make love?
"
1 11 Cartman "No way!
"
1 11 Cartman "That's not what we just heard!
"
1 11 Cartman "What the hell...? 
"
1 11 Cartman "Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
"
1 12 Cartman "Boooriing. 
"
1 12 Cartman "Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I found it.
"
1 12 Cartman "No, I did, Pip.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
"
1 12 Cartman "Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
"
1 12 Cartman "Okay, ready? I'll go first. 
"
1 12 Cartman "Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
"
1 12 Cartman "Eeyy! Give me that back!
"
1 12 Cartman "We'll roshambo for it!
"
1 12 Cartman "ANTHROPOLOGIST!
"
1 12 Cartman "I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
"
1 12 Cartman "Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
"
1 12 Cartman "...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
"
1 12 Cartman "Screw you, triangle thief!
"
