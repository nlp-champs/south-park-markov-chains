13 1 Kyle "Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
13 1 Kyle "This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
13 1 Kyle "I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
13 1 Kyle "What?!
"
13 1 Kyle "Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
13 1 Kyle "W-well, we've heard that she's...
"
13 1 Kyle "Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
13 1 Kyle "You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
13 1 Kyle "What kind of protection?
"
13 1 Kyle "Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
13 1 Kyle "What's that?
"
13 1 Kyle "...Well, what does that mean?
"
13 1 Kyle "Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yup, he's in here. 
"
13 1 Kyle "We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
13 1 Kyle "It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
13 1 Kyle "Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
"
13 1 Kyle "What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
"
13 1 Kyle "Cartman?
"
13 1 Kyle "Dow... 
"
13 1 Kyle "We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"
13 1 Kyle "Well, now we know.
"
13 2 Kyle "...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
"
13 2 Kyle "...Dude, what?!
"
13 2 Kyle "Why do you care?
"
13 2 Kyle "Whoa, what the?
"
13 2 Kyle "Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
"
13 2 Kyle "Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
"
13 2 Kyle "Who? Me? Why?
"
13 3 Kyle "Well this sucks!
"
13 3 Kyle "You want something new every week, fatass.
"
13 3 Kyle "My fault?
"
13 3 Kyle "Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
"
13 3 Kyle "Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
"
13 3 Kyle "Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
"
13 3 Kyle "What's that? 
"
13 3 Kyle "What? 
"
13 3 Kyle "What's going on?
"
13 3 Kyle "What did he do?
"
13 3 Kyle "Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
"
13 3 Kyle "Come on, this is ridiculous!
"
13 3 Kyle "Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel.

13 3 Kyle "Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real.

"
13 3 Kyle "I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
"
13 3 Kyle "I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
"
13 3 Kyle "Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
"
13 3 Kyle "There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
"
13 3 Kyle "It's okay, Ma.
"
13 3 Kyle "Heunh. 
"
13 3 Kyle "Aww, come on!
"
13 4 Kyle "Come on guys, we gotta go! 
"
13 4 Kyle "It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
"
13 4 Kyle "Robbed us of our innocence.
"
13 4 Kyle "Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
"
13 5 Kyle "We know, Cartman!
"
13 5 Kyle "Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
"
13 5 Kyle "Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
"
13 5 Kyle "I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
"
13 5 Kyle "What?
"
13 5 Kyle "Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
"
13 5 Kyle "No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""
"
13 5 Kyle "Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
"
13 5 Kyle "You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
"
13 5 Kyle "Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
"
13 7 Kyle "Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
"
13 7 Kyle "No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
13 7 Kyle "Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
"
13 7 Kyle "Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
"
13 7 Kyle "Please. Please let him go.
"
13 7 Kyle "Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
"
13 7 Kyle "Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
13 7 Kyle "Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
"
13 7 Kyle "I'll call you back. 
"
13 7 Kyle "What? Are you sure?
"
13 7 Kyle """Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Mis√©rables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
"
13 7 Kyle "Oh God. What have I done?
"
13 7 Kyle "No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"
13 7 Kyle "I know! I was lying then!
"
13 7 Kyle "This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
"
13 7 Kyle "Cartman, knock it off!
"
13 7 Kyle "They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike! Ike, what?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"
13 8 Kyle "I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.
"
13 8 Kyle "What?
"
13 8 Kyle "What?! Are you serious?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
"
13 8 Kyle "NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
"
13 8 Kyle "What was what?
"
13 8 Kyle "Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"
13 8 Kyle "It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
13 8 Kyle "I just... don't understand it.
"
13 8 Kyle "But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
"
13 8 Kyle "But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
"
13 8 Kyle "Purgatory? What's that?
"
13 8 Kyle "What?
"
13 8 Kyle "Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
"
13 8 Kyle "Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
"
13 8 Kyle "Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Comoe back here! 
"
13 8 Kyle "Hey! Heeey!
"
13 8 Kyle "Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
"
13 8 Kyle "What the hell are we going to do??
"
13 8 Kyle "Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
"
13 8 Kyle "So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
"
13 8 Kyle "Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"
13 8 Kyle "And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
"
13 8 Kyle "What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"
13 8 Kyle "Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
"
13 8 Kyle "Go on by, Michael. 
"
13 8 Kyle "Aww crap!
"
13 8 Kyle "We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
"
13 8 Kyle "Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
13 8 Kyle "So what?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike!  Ike, you're back!
"
13 8 Kyle "It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
"
13 9 Kyle "So what?
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
"
13 9 Kyle "Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
"
13 9 Kyle "Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
"
13 9 Kyle "You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, I really think we should talk.
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, what's happened to you?
"
13 10 Kyle "Wrestling is awesome!
"
13 10 Kyle "Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
"
13 10 Kyle "Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
"
13 10 Kyle "Cool!
"
13 10 Kyle "Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"
13 10 Kyle "I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
"
13 10 Kyle "Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
"
13 10 Kyle "Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
"
13 10 Kyle "If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
"
13 10 Kyle "Irene, no! Why?
"
13 10 Kyle "Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
"
13 10 Kyle "Let's do this! One! Two!
"
13 10 Kyle "So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
"
13 10 Kyle "What dude? 
"
13 10 Kyle "This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
"
13 10 Kyle "Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
13 10 Kyle "Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"
13 10 Kyle "I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
"
13 10 Kyle "I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
13 10 Kyle "Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
13 10 Kyle "What are you talking about?
"
13 10 Kyle "What?
"
13 10 Kyle "Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
"
13 10 Kyle "So what do we do?
"
13 10 Kyle "How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
"
13 10 Kyle "That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
"
13 10 Kyle "He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
"
13 10 Kyle "You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"
13 10 Kyle "Wait a minute. Who is that?
"
13 10 Kyle "You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
"
13 10 Kyle "What?
"
13 10 Kyle "Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
"
13 11 Kyle "Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
13 11 Kyle "What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
"
13 11 Kyle "Hello? Stan?
"
13 12 Kyle "This... is exactly what I needed.
"
13 12 Kyle "Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
"
13 12 Kyle "Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13 12 Kyle "Yes.
"
13 12 Kyle "Sounds good.
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
13 12 Kyle "W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
"
13 12 Kyle "We aren't talking about gay people.
"
13 12 Kyle "Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
"
13 12 Kyle "Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
"
13 12 Kyle "I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"
13 12 Kyle "We're sorry, Mayor.
"
13 12 Kyle "We gotta run! 
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah. You definitely made your point.
"
13 12 Kyle "I don't either.
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
"
13 13 Kyle "Will somebody shut him up?
"
13 13 Kyle "Oh God, no! 
"
13 13 Kyle """These, are the morning announcements."" 
"
13 13 Kyle "Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
13 14 Kyle "All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
"
13 14 Kyle "You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"
13 14 Kyle "Okay, go ahead. 
"
13 14 Kyle "I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
"
13 14 Kyle "All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
"
13 14 Kyle "No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
13 14 Kyle "No they don't!
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude!
"
13 14 Kyle "NO!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'm not getting back in the water.
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
"
13 14 Kyle "Do you pee in the pool?
"
13 14 Kyle "Aw, come on!
"
13 14 Kyle "Most likely.
"
13 14 Kyle "So what?
"
13 14 Kyle "Well then they're not minorities, are they?
"
13 14 Kyle "Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
"
13 14 Kyle "No, you're the minority!
"
13 14 Kyle "Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Eewww! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aaaaah! Gross! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aw, sick! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aahhh...
"
13 14 Kyle "No way!
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, that's all pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'll die if I do swim in it!
"
13 14 Kyle "Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
"
13 14 Kyle "...What?!
"
13 14 Kyle "You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
"
13 14 Kyle "That is gross!!
"
13 14 Kyle "Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
"
13 14 Kyle "Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
"
13 14 Kyle "No.
"
13 14 Kyle "Not in pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "Oh who pees in the shower?
"
13 14 Kyle "You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
"
13 14 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
13 14 Kyle "Let's just get this over with!
"
13 14 Kyle "Yes.
"
13 14 Kyle "What?!
"
13 14 Kyle "Why?!
"
13 14 Kyle "I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
"
13 14 Kyle "No!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'm thinking about it!
"
13 14 Kyle "Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
"
13 14 Kyle "Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Are you fucking kidding me?! 
"
13 14 Kyle "That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
"
13 14 Kyle "Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
"
13 14 Kyle "Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"
13 14 Kyle "What the hell for?!
"
13 14 Kyle "AAAAAAAA!
"
13 1 Kyle "Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
13 1 Kyle "This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
13 1 Kyle "I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
13 1 Kyle "What?!
"
13 1 Kyle "Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
13 1 Kyle "W-well, we've heard that she's...
"
13 1 Kyle "Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
13 1 Kyle "You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
13 1 Kyle "What kind of protection?
"
13 1 Kyle "Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
13 1 Kyle "What's that?
"
13 1 Kyle "...Well, what does that mean?
"
13 1 Kyle "Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yup, he's in here. 
"
13 1 Kyle "We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
13 1 Kyle "It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
13 1 Kyle "Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
13 1 Kyle "Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
"
13 1 Kyle "What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
"
13 1 Kyle "Cartman?
"

13 5 Kyle "Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
"
13 5 Kyle "No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""
"
13 5 Kyle "Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
"
13 5 Kyle "You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
"
13 5 Kyle "Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
"
13 7 Kyle "Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
"
13 7 Kyle "No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
13 7 Kyle "Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
"
13 7 Kyle "Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
"
13 7 Kyle "Please. Please let him go.
"
13 7 Kyle "Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
"
13 7 Kyle "Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
13 7 Kyle "Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
"
13 7 Kyle "I'll call you back. 
"
13 7 Kyle "What? Are you sure?
"
13 7 Kyle """Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Mis√©rables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
"
13 7 Kyle "Oh God. What have I done?
"
13 7 Kyle "No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"
13 7 Kyle "I know! I was lying then!
"
13 7 Kyle "This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
"
13 7 Kyle "Cartman, knock it off!
"
13 7 Kyle "They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike! Ike, what?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"
13 8 Kyle "I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.
"
13 8 Kyle "What?
"
13 8 Kyle "What?! Are you serious?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
"
13 8 Kyle "NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
"
13 8 Kyle "What was what?
"
13 8 Kyle "Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"
13 8 Kyle "It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
13 8 Kyle "I just... don't understand it.
"
13 8 Kyle "But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
"
13 8 Kyle "But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
"
13 8 Kyle "Purgatory? What's that?
"
13 8 Kyle "What?
"
13 8 Kyle "Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
"
13 8 Kyle "Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
"
13 8 Kyle "Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Comoe back here! 
"
13 8 Kyle "Hey! Heeey!
"
13 8 Kyle "Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
"
13 8 Kyle "What the hell are we going to do??
"
13 8 Kyle "Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
"
13 8 Kyle "So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
"
13 8 Kyle "Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"
13 8 Kyle "And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
"
13 8 Kyle "What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"
13 8 Kyle "Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
"
13 8 Kyle "Go on by, Michael. 
"
13 8 Kyle "Aww crap!
"
13 8 Kyle "We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
"
13 8 Kyle "Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
13 8 Kyle "So what?!
"
13 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
13 8 Kyle "Ike!  Ike, you're back!
"
13 8 Kyle "It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
"
13 9 Kyle "So what?
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
"
13 9 Kyle "Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
"
13 9 Kyle "Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
"
13 9 Kyle "You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, I really think we should talk.
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
"
13 9 Kyle "Butters, what's happened to you?
"
13 10 Kyle "Wrestling is awesome!
"
13 10 Kyle "Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
"
13 10 Kyle "Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
"
13 10 Kyle "Cool!
"
13 10 Kyle "Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"
13 10 Kyle "I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
"
13 10 Kyle "Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
"
13 10 Kyle "Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
"
13 10 Kyle "If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
"
13 10 Kyle "Irene, no! Why?
"
13 10 Kyle "Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
"
13 10 Kyle "Let's do this! One! Two!
"
13 10 Kyle "So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
"
13 10 Kyle "What dude? 
"
13 10 Kyle "This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
"
13 10 Kyle "Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
13 10 Kyle "Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"
13 10 Kyle "I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
"
13 10 Kyle "I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
13 10 Kyle "Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
13 10 Kyle "What are you talking about?
"
13 10 Kyle "What?
"
13 10 Kyle "Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
"
13 10 Kyle "So what do we do?
"
13 10 Kyle "How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
"
13 10 Kyle "That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
"
13 10 Kyle "He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
"
13 10 Kyle "You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"
13 10 Kyle "Wait a minute. Who is that?
"
13 10 Kyle "You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
"
13 10 Kyle "What?
"
13 10 Kyle "Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
"
13 11 Kyle "Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
13 11 Kyle "What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
"
13 11 Kyle "Hello? Stan?
"
13 12 Kyle "This... is exactly what I needed.
"
13 12 Kyle "Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
"
13 12 Kyle "Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13 12 Kyle "Yes.
"
13 12 Kyle "Sounds good.
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
13 12 Kyle "W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
"
13 12 Kyle "We aren't talking about gay people.
"
13 12 Kyle "Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
"
13 12 Kyle "Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
"
13 12 Kyle "I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"
13 12 Kyle "We're sorry, Mayor.
"
13 12 Kyle "We gotta run! 
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah. You definitely made your point.
"
13 12 Kyle "I don't either.
"
13 12 Kyle "Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
"
13 13 Kyle "Will somebody shut him up?
"
13 13 Kyle "Oh God, no! 
"
13 13 Kyle """These, are the morning announcements."" 
"
13 13 Kyle "Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
13 14 Kyle "All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
"
13 14 Kyle "You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"
13 14 Kyle "Okay, go ahead. 
"
13 14 Kyle "I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
"
13 14 Kyle "All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
"
13 14 Kyle "No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
13 14 Kyle "No they don't!
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude!
"
13 14 Kyle "NO!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'm not getting back in the water.
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
"
13 14 Kyle "Do you pee in the pool?
"
13 14 Kyle "Aw, come on!
"
13 14 Kyle "Most likely.
"
13 14 Kyle "So what?
"
13 14 Kyle "Well then they're not minorities, are they?
"
13 14 Kyle "Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
"
13 14 Kyle "No, you're the minority!
"
13 14 Kyle "Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Eewww! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aaaaah! Gross! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aw, sick! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Aahhh...
"
13 14 Kyle "No way!
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, that's all pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'll die if I do swim in it!
"
13 14 Kyle "Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
"
13 14 Kyle "...What?!
"
13 14 Kyle "You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
"
13 14 Kyle "That is gross!!
"
13 14 Kyle "Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
"
13 14 Kyle "Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
"
13 14 Kyle "Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
"
13 14 Kyle "No.
"
13 14 Kyle "Not in pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "Oh who pees in the shower?
"
13 14 Kyle "You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
"
13 14 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
13 14 Kyle "Let's just get this over with!
"
13 14 Kyle "Yes.
"
13 14 Kyle "What?!
"
13 14 Kyle "Why?!
"
13 14 Kyle "I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
"
13 14 Kyle "That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
"
13 14 Kyle "No!
"
13 14 Kyle "I'm thinking about it!
"
13 14 Kyle "Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
"
13 14 Kyle "Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
"
13 14 Kyle "Are you fucking kidding me?! 
"
13 14 Kyle "That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
"
13 14 Kyle "Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
"
13 14 Kyle "Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"
13 14 Kyle "What the hell for?!
"
13 14 Kyle "AAAAAAAA!
"
