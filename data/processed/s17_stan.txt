17 1 Stan "Wow.
"
17 2 Stan "You guys are watchin' murder porn?
"
17 2 Stan "Okaaay. 
"
17 2 Stan "What's up dude?
"
17 2 Stan "Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
"
17 2 Stan "...What?!
"
17 2 Stan "What happened?
"
17 2 Stan "What?
"
17 2 Stan "You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
"
17 2 Stan "That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
"
17 2 Stan "What?
"
17 2 Stan "Butters, what happened?
"
17 2 Stan "Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
"
17 2 Stan "In Minecraft.
"
17 2 Stan "Whattaya mean?
"
17 2 Stan "It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
"
17 2 Stan "Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
"
17 2 Stan "What, dude?
"
17 2 Stan "So?
"
17 2 Stan "Aha! 
"
17 2 Stan "You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
"
17 2 Stan "No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
"
17 2 Stan "Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
"
17 2 Stan "We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"
17 2 Stan "No, that's way too long!
"
17 2 Stan "Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
"
17 2 Stan "What?
"
17 2 Stan "I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
"
17 2 Stan "I... said it would really bum them out.
"
17 2 Stan "Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
"
17 3 Stan "Is he doing it again?
"
17 3 Stan "Cartman, are you feeling alright?
"
17 3 Stan "That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
"
17 5 Stan "He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
"
17 6 Stan "How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
"
17 6 Stan "What the fuck?
"
17 6 Stan "Hey Kyle.
"
17 6 Stan "Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
"
17 6 Stan "...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
"
17 6 Stan "You like... how they smell? How they taste?
"
17 6 Stan "They're really that good?
"
17 6 Stan "Should I try them?
"
17 6 Stan "...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
"
17 6 Stan "I don't get it, Kenny.
"
17 6 Stan "Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
"
17 6 Stan "Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
"
17 6 Stan "Hey Kyle.
"
17 6 Stan "Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
"
17 6 Stan "If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
"
17 6 Stan "All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
"
17 6 Stan "See? You sound like a dick.
"
17 6 Stan "Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
"
17 6 Stan "I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"
17 6 Stan "This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
"
17 6 Stan "Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
"
17 6 Stan "No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
"
17 6 Stan "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
"
17 6 Stan "Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
"
17 6 Stan "You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""
"
17 6 Stan "You should apologize to Kenny too.
"
17 6 Stan "The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
"
17 7 Stan "It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
"
17 7 Stan "The House of Greyhawk?
"
17 7 Stan "I like the PS4's controller better.
"
17 7 Stan "The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
"
17 7 Stan "If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
"
17 7 Stan "We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
"
17 7 Stan "Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"
17 7 Stan "No, you can't do that!
"
17 7 Stan "Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
"
17 7 Stan "Exactly!
"
17 7 Stan "...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
"
17 7 Stan "And who do we have on our side?
"
17 7 Stan "Did you ask the Vamp kids?
"
17 7 Stan "There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
"
17 7 Stan "So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
"
17 7 Stan "When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
"
17 8 Stan "Let them pass!  
"
17 8 Stan "The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
"
17 8 Stan "The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
"
17 8 Stan "The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
"
17 8 Stan "What I started? How dare you!
"
17 8 Stan "I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
"
17 8 Stan "The gods will find us a way!
"
17 9 Stan "Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
"
17 9 Stan "The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
"
17 9 Stan "I have no idea.
"
17 9 Stan "Yes?
"
17 9 Stan "What? 
"
17 9 Stan "So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
"
17 9 Stan "And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
"
17 9 Stan "Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
"
17 9 Stan "Yeah, sure, what about it?
"
17 9 Stan "Why?
"
17 9 Stan "Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
"
17 9 Stan "Who is that?
"
17 9 Stan "Did Kyle know about this?
"
17 9 Stan "Did Kyle know about this?!
"
17 9 Stan "Huh? Hello? Who is that? 
"
17 9 Stan "Get out of here!
"
17 9 Stan "You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
"
17 9 Stan "I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
"
17 9 Stan "...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
"
17 9 Stan "You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
"
17 9 Stan "Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
"
17 9 Stan "We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
"
17 9 Stan "I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
"
17 9 Stan "Yay.
"
17 9 Stan "Yes, it is.
"
17 9 Stan "Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
"
17 10 Stan "Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
"
17 10 Stan "Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"
17 10 Stan "She looks pretty hot here.
"
17 10 Stan "Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
"
17 10 Stan "A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
"
17 10 Stan "Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
"
17 10 Stan "I do? 
"
17 1 Stan "Wow.
"
17 2 Stan "You guys are watchin' murder porn?
"
17 2 Stan "Okaaay. 
"
17 2 Stan "What's up dude?
"
17 2 Stan "Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
"
17 2 Stan "...What?!
"
17 2 Stan "What happened?
