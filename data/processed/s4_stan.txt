4 1 Stan "We win again! 
"
4 1 Stan "Sleds are for guys.
"
4 1 Stan "Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
"
4 1 Stan "You got it!
"
4 1 Stan "Noo problem!
"
4 1 Stan "Oh, boy! We'll show them!
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
"
4 1 Stan "Hello?
"
4 1 Stan "Son of a bitch!
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
"
4 1 Stan "Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
"
4 1 Stan "Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
"
4 1 Stan "Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
"
4 1 Stan "Nice going, fat boy!
"
4 1 Stan "Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
"
4 1 Stan "Come on, let's get it a try. 
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah-
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, bail! Bail! 
"
4 1 Stan "Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
"
4 1 Stan "We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
"
4 1 Stan "Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
"
4 1 Stan "You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
"
4 1 Stan "That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
"
4 1 Stan "I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
"
4 1 Stan "Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
"
4 1 Stan "...Yeah.
"
4 1 Stan "Sshh! 
"
4 1 Stan "How are we supposed to give them to you?
"
4 1 Stan "But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, here. 
"
4 1 Stan "Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
"
4 1 Stan "That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
"
4 1 Stan "There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah. 
"
4 1 Stan "Hi. Can Token come out and play?
"
4 1 Stan "Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
"
4 1 Stan "It's not?
"
4 1 Stan "Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
"
4 1 Stan "Okay, go ahead and start.
"
4 1 Stan "Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
"
4 1 Stan "If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
"
4 1 Stan "Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
"
4 1 Stan "That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
"
4 1 Stan "Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, where's Clyde.
"
4 1 Stan "Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
"
4 1 Stan "It's Cartman!
"
4 1 Stan "All right! Let's do this!
"
4 1 Stan "Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
"
4 1 Stan "We're not gonna make it! 
"
4 1 Stan "We did it!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
"
4 2 Stan "What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
"
4 2 Stan "Two dollars!
"
4 2 Stan "For one tooth?
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
"
4 2 Stan "I already lost all my baby teeth.
"
4 2 Stan "Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
"
4 2 Stan "What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
"
4 2 Stan "Uh, Butters, could we have it?
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
"
4 2 Stan "I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
"
4 2 Stan "Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
"
4 2 Stan "Well?
"
4 2 Stan "Oh my God!
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, where's the money?
"
4 2 Stan "What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
"
4 2 Stan "Tell us what?!
"
4 2 Stan "Dude.
"
4 2 Stan "You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
"
4 2 Stan "Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
"
4 2 Stan "So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
"
4 2 Stan "The kid will never even know.
"
4 2 Stan "We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"
4 2 Stan "Come on, Kyle! 
"
4 2 Stan "Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""
"
4 2 Stan "There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
"
4 2 Stan "This is the smartest business venture ever. 
"
4 2 Stan "Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
"
4 2 Stan "...Hey, you can't do that!
"
4 2 Stan "Because that's what we're doing!
"
4 2 Stan "You scram! We were here first!
"
4 2 Stan "You woke him up! 
"
4 2 Stan "Who's the Boss?
"
4 2 Stan "Uuh, yeah.
"
4 2 Stan "Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
"
4 2 Stan "Well, uh-what do you mean?
"
4 2 Stan "What's a ""tooth trade?""
"
4 2 Stan "Amazing.
"
4 2 Stan "Oh. Uh-I don't know.
"
4 2 Stan "How much do we get if we work for you?
"
4 2 Stan "We're in!
"
4 2 Stan "We all want double-desserts today!
"
4 2 Stan "U-uh, Chef.
"
4 2 Stan "Chef!
"
4 2 Stan "CHEF!
"
4 2 Stan "We're not dealing drugs!
"
4 2 Stan "No!
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
"
4 2 Stan "We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, just stop thinking about it.
"
4 2 Stan "Kyle?
"
4 2 Stan "Aw, shit.
"
4 2 Stan "What?
"
4 2 Stan "Really?
"
4 2 Stan "So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
"
4 3 Stan "Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
"
4 3 Stan "Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
"
4 3 Stan "Two hours.
"
4 3 Stan "Damn, dude. 
"
4 3 Stan "Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
"
4 3 Stan "Dude, this isn't working.
"
4 3 Stan "Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
"
4 3 Stan "I'm tired, Grandpa.
"
4 3 Stan "I don't know.  Whoa. 
"
4 3 Stan "Hurry up, you guys!
"
4 3 Stan "Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
"
4 3 Stan "Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
"
4 3 Stan "Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
"
4 3 Stan "Okay, hold it, hold it. 
"
4 3 Stan "What?!
"
4 3 Stan "Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
"
4 3 Stan "They have nowhere else to go.  Please?
"
4 3 Stan "That's your dad?
"
4 3 Stan "Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
"
4 3 Stan "No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
"
4 3 Stan "Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
"
4 3 Stan "No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
"
4 3 Stan "Now what do we do?
"
4 3 Stan "Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
"
4 3 Stan "The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah! Well, not this time!
"
4 3 Stan "We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
"
4 3 Stan "Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
"
4 3 Stan "Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"
4 3 Stan "Come on, angry mob! 
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 3 Stan "Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
"
4 3 Stan "Whatever happened to Kenny?
"
4 4 Stan "Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
"
4 4 Stan "I know!
"
4 4 Stan "Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
"
4 4 Stan "But he is-
"
4 4 Stan "He doesn't have to do homework?
"
4 4 Stan "I've got ADD.
"
4 4 Stan "Dude, it's Timmy.
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
"
4 4 Stan "But he's funny.
"
4 4 Stan "He looks pretty happy to me.
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
"
4 4 Stan "Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
"
4 4 Stan "Because we're on Ritalin.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh boy oh boy.
"
4 4 Stan "But there are no side effects, Chef.
"
4 4 Stan "See what?
"
4 4 Stan "Let's watch something else.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
4 4 Stan "Sounds good.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
"
4 4 Stan "Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
"
4 4 Stan "Sure was, Dad.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 
"
4 4 Stan "I feel... different.
"
4 4 Stan "Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
"
4 4 Stan "Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
"
4 4 Stan "No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
"
4 6 Stan "Um, deny it?
"
4 6 Stan "Sweet.
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
"
4 6 Stan "You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
"
4 6 Stan "Oh, man, that's terrible.
"
4 6 Stan "Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.
"
4 6 Stan "Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
"
4 6 Stan "We're making faces at sick people.
"
4 6 Stan "We don't know.
"
4 6 Stan "You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
"
4 6 Stan "We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
"
4 6 Stan "We got invited too, fatass!
"
4 6 Stan "This is boring.
"
4 6 Stan "That seems kind of... weird.
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 6 Stan "Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
"
4 6 Stan "Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! 
"
4 6 Stan "Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
"
4 6 Stan "And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
"
4 7 Stan "Here! 
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, what the hell was that?
"
4 7 Stan "...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
"
4 7 Stan "You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
"
4 7 Stan "He's fakin'!
"
4 7 Stan "Now, that's a get-well card! 
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
"
4 7 Stan "Go on, Butters!
"
4 7 Stan "Butters, go on!
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you really are sick, huh?
"
4 7 Stan "Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
"
4 7 Stan "Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
"
4 7 Stan "What?
"
4 7 Stan "Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
"
4 7 Stan "Don't be a smartass?
"
4 7 Stan "Hi, doctor. 
"
4 7 Stan "Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
"
4 7 Stan "But I don't think it's working.
"
4 7 Stan "Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
"
4 7 Stan "...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
"
4 7 Stan "Who?  Oh, shit.
"
4 7 Stan "Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
"
4 7 Stan "Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
"
4 7 Stan "What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"
4 7 Stan "His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
"
4 7 Stan "Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
"
4 7 Stan "But you only need one, fat boy!
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
"
4 7 Stan "Oh my God!
"
4 7 Stan "Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
"
4 7 Stan "What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
"
4 7 Stan "Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
"
4 7 Stan "You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
"
4 7 Stan "Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
"
4 7 Stan "Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
"
4 7 Stan "And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"
4 7 Stan "Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
"
4 7 Stan "I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
"
4 7 Stan "I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
"
4 7 Stan "Come on, where are they? 
"
4 7 Stan "This is it??
"
4 7 Stan "This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
"
4 7 Stan "Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
"
4 7 Stan "We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 
"
4 7 Stan "Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
"
4 7 Stan "Sshhh!
"
4 7 Stan "If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
"
4 7 Stan "Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
"
4 7 Stan "Oh, phew.
"
4 7 Stan "Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
"
4 7 Stan "...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
"
4 7 Stan "You suck, Cartman!
"
4 7 Stan "God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
"
4 7 Stan "There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
"
4 7 Stan "My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
"
4 7 Stan "Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! 
"
4 7 Stan "So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
"
4 7 Stan "That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
"
4 7 Stan "Alright, alright, here. 
"
4 7 Stan "You look a lot better.
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
"
4 7 Stan "Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
"
4 7 Stan "It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
"
4 7 Stan "Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
"
4 7 Stan "Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 
"
4 8 Stan "You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"
4 8 Stan "Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
"
4 8 Stan "Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
"
4 8 Stan "Islam??
"
4 8 Stan "Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
"
4 8 Stan "Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
"
4 8 Stan "But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
"
4 8 Stan "Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
"
4 8 Stan "I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
"
4 8 Stan "Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
"
4 8 Stan "Do you think they should change the flag?
"
4 8 Stan "That was a good one.
"
4 8 Stan "Wait, I don't get it.
"
4 9 Stan "Boy band?
"
4 9 Stan "Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
"
4 9 Stan "He's right.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, I guess.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
"
4 9 Stan "Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
"
4 9 Stan "Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
"
4 9 Stan "Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
"
4 9 Stan "Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
"
4 9 Stan "Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
"
4 9 Stan "Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
"
4 9 Stan "She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
"
4 9 Stan "Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
"
4 9 Stan "Costumes? 
"
4 9 Stan "Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"
4 9 Stan "Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?
"
4 9 Stan "Kenny says that's not what it means.
"
4 9 Stan "Uh oh, mall cops.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 9 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
4 9 Stan "We are making a music video.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I was just a--
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
"
4 9 Stan "No.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad!
"
4 9 Stan "It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
"
4 9 Stan "I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
"
4 9 Stan "Dad? What the hell is going on?
"
4 9 Stan "Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
"
4 9 Stan "...Oh-kay.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad?
"
4 9 Stan "Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 9 Stan "Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
"
4 9 Stan "Really?
"
4 9 Stan "Alright! 
"
4 9 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
4 9 Stan "Oh, yes we do.
"
4 9 Stan "You were great, Dad.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
"
4 9 Stan "I don't think they sell those anymore. 
"
4 10 Stan "Bo-ring.
"
4 10 Stan "Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's...""
"
4 10 Stan """It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-""
"
4 10 Stan "Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
"
4 10 Stan "We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
"
4 10 Stan "Are we gonna go to hell?
"
4 10 Stan "What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
"
4 10 Stan "But crackers are his- body.
"
4 10 Stan "Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
"
4 10 Stan "No??
"
4 10 Stan "Confession? 
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
"
4 10 Stan "And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
"
4 10 Stan "We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
"
4 10 Stan "Have you confessed all your sins yet?
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
"
4 10 Stan "Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
"
4 10 Stan "What, Butters?
"
4 10 Stan "Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
"
4 10 Stan "I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"
4 10 Stan "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
"
4 10 Stan "Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
"
4 10 Stan "The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
"
4 10 Stan "I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
"
4 10 Stan "...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
"
4 10 Stan "God damnit!
"
4 10 Stan "Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
"
4 10 Stan "We have a question.
"
4 10 Stan "Where do handicapped people go when they die?
"
4 10 Stan "But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
"
4 10 Stan "What happened??
"
4 10 Stan "I don't think so.
"
4 10 Stan "Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
"
4 10 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!
"
4 10 Stan "Oh, shit!  Oh!
"
4 10 Stan "But what about them?
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, come on. 
"
4 10 Stan "Come on! This stupid light won't change.
"
4 10 Stan "We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
"
4 10 Stan "Uh, come on, let's go. 
"
4 10 Stan "...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 10 Stan "He's doomed.
"
4 10 Stan "Oh no! It's locked!
"
4 10 Stan "Confession box is over there! 
"
4 10 Stan "You're a sinner!
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4 10 Stan "Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 
"
4 11 Stan "Let's go. 
"
4 11 Stan "...they've killed Kenny!
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4 11 Stan "Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
"
4 11 Stan "What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
"
4 11 Stan "There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"
4 11 Stan "Wow, cool.
"
4 11 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 11 Stan "What?
"
4 11 Stan "Kenny?!  What's he say?
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
"
4 11 Stan "What worked?
"
4 11 Stan "Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
"
4 11 Stan "Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
"
4 11 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 12 Stan "Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
"
4 12 Stan "What grade are you going into?
"
4 12 Stan "Stupid third grader!
"
4 12 Stan "Denver? 
"
4 12 Stan "Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
"
4 12 Stan "Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!
"
4 12 Stan "...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
"
4 12 Stan "Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!""
"
4 12 Stan "We got you covered, Timmy.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
"
4 12 Stan "...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
"
4 12 Stan "What a bitch!
"
4 12 Stan "This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
"
4 12 Stan "Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
"
4 12 Stan "We travel back in time.
"
4 12 Stan "It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
"
4 12 Stan "We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
"
4 12 Stan "Back in the third grade.
"
4 12 Stan "Oh! Here she comes.
"
4 12 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 12 Stan "Timmy, you have to stop!
"
4 12 Stan "No??
"
4 12 Stan "So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
"
4 12 Stan "My God!
"
4 12 Stan "Over here, over here!
"
4 12 Stan "Less than 20 minutes?!
"
4 12 Stan "Well, who didn't see that coming?
"
4 12 Stan "...nine, eight...
"
4 12 Stan "Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
"
4 12 Stan "W-what did you get in a fight about?
"
4 12 Stan "Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
"
4 12 Stan "Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
"
4 12 Stan "God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
"
4 12 Stan "I know.
"
4 12 Stan "Wait a minute! I've got it. 
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
"
4 12 Stan "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
4 12 Stan "Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude. Sh-she's right.
"
4 12 Stan "Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
"
4 13 Stan "Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
"
4 13 Stan "But isn't he only three years old?
"
4 13 Stan "Cool!
"
4 13 Stan "Wow, cool!
"
4 13 Stan "Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
"
4 13 Stan "But they smell like pee.
"
4 13 Stan "Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"
4 13 Stan "Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
"
4 13 Stan "Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
"
4 13 Stan "Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4 13 Stan "What the hell just happened?
"
4 13 Stan "Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
"
4 13 Stan "Wow, that's amazing.
"
4 13 Stan "What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
"
4 13 Stan "Yes!
"
4 13 Stan "So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"
4 13 Stan "Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 13 Stan "Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!
"
4 13 Stan "Can I do it?
"
4 13 Stan "Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
"
4 13 Stan "Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
"
4 13 Stan "He's right there.
"
4 13 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
4 13 Stan "Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
"
4 13 Stan "Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
"
4 13 Stan "You break it down!
"
4 13 Stan "Not it! You lose, Kenny. 
"
4 13 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 13 Stan "Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, you have to stop!
"
4 13 Stan "He is in there.
"
4 13 Stan "One-two-three, not it!
"
4 13 Stan "Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
"
4 13 Stan "No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
"
4 13 Stan "This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
"
4 13 Stan "He did it!
"
4 13 Stan "You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
"
4 13 Stan "Huh, that's a bitch.
"
4 13 Stan "Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 14 Stan "'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
"
4 14 Stan "E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
"
4 14 Stan "'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
"
4 14 Stan "Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
"
4 14 Stan "Oh yeah, we can't!
"
4 14 Stan "You do?
"
4 14 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 14 Stan "No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
"
4 14 Stan "Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
"
4 14 Stan "No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
"
4 14 Stan "Helen!
"
4 14 Stan "Oh no! 
"
4 14 Stan "Okay, here we go. 
"
4 14 Stan "We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
"
4 15 Stan "I can't do it, dude.
"
4 15 Stan "Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
"
4 15 Stan "That's so gross.
"
4 15 Stan "I'll throw in five.
"
4 15 Stan "forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
"
4 15 Stan "Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
"
4 15 Stan "Well, at least you got it out of your system.
"
4 15 Stan "Oh, you guys!
"
4 15 Stan "You know, dude, there might be something to this.
"
4 15 Stan "We knew he wouldn't make it.
"
4 15 Stan "I don't believe it.
"
4 15 Stan "Did you like the old one?
"
4 15 Stan "We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
"
4 15 Stan "What's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
"
4 15 Stan "Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
"
4 15 Stan "Like what?
"
4 15 Stan "No.
"
4 15 Stan "Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
"
4 15 Stan "Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
"
4 15 Stan "You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
"
4 15 Stan "For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
"
4 15 Stan "I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
"
4 15 Stan "I know! 
"
4 15 Stan "Deal, druggie!
"
4 15 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
"
4 16 Stan "Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
"
4 16 Stan "We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
"
4 16 Stan "Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
"
4 16 Stan "Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
"
4 16 Stan "The police?
"
4 16 Stan "But what do the police do to them?
"
4 16 Stan "Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
"
4 16 Stan "What's going on?
"
4 16 Stan "...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
"
4 16 Stan "You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
"
4 16 Stan "How come you wanna help the fatass?!
"
4 16 Stan "You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
"
4 16 Stan "You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
"
4 16 Stan "If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
"
4 16 Stan "Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
"
4 16 Stan "Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
"
4 16 Stan "And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
"
4 16 Stan "Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
"
4 16 Stan "The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
"
4 16 Stan "So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
"
4 16 Stan "We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
"
4 16 Stan "Yes. No foolies.
"
4 16 Stan "Awesu-home!
"
4 16 Stan "No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
"
4 16 Stan "It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
"
4 16 Stan "Parents?
"
4 16 Stan "He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
"
4 16 Stan "Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
"
4 16 Stan "Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
"
4 16 Stan "Hey, you guys came back!
"
4 16 Stan "Huh.
"
4 16 Stan "I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
"
4 17 Stan "A-ah huh.
"
4 17 Stan "Ho-o-oh.
"
4 17 Stan "What is this all about, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
"
4 17 Stan "Nobody's paying any attention. 
"
4 17 Stan "This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
"
4 17 Stan "Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
"
4 17 Stan "How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
"
4 17 Stan "And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
"
4 17 Stan "What, dude?
"
4 17 Stan "We don't know anything about animation.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" 
"
4 17 Stan "It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
"
4 17 Stan "That's not me, that's you!
"
4 17 Stan "No, that's okay. 
"
4 17 Stan "Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
"
4 17 Stan "Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4 17 Stan "Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
"
4 17 Stan "You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
"
4 17 Stan "What's awesome?
"
4 17 Stan "That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
"
4 17 Stan "Easy.
"
4 17 Stan "Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
"
4 17 Stan "Okay.  One.
"
4 17 Stan "Kickass!
"
4 17 Stan "Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
"
4 17 Stan "E mouths...
"
4 17 Stan "1  2.
"
4 17 Stan """We wish you a m- Merry""
"
4 17 Stan "AAAAAAAA!
"
4 17 Stan "That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
"
4 17 Stan "We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
"
4 17 Stan "Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
"
4 17 Stan "We love
"
4 17 Stan "Tralala
"
4 17 Stan "We sit.
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan """Awgh! I'm so fat!""
"
4 17 Stan """Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""
"
4 17 Stan "Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
"
4 17 Stan "Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
"
4 17 Stan "We wish
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan "We sit.
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan "...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
"
4 17 Stan "Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4 17 Stan "Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
"
4 17 Stan "You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
"
4 17 Stan "For nothing.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
"
4 17 Stan "No not ham!
"
4 17 Stan "...Christmas is about something much more important!
"
4 17 Stan "Presents.
"
4 17 Stan "Don't you see, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "Presents.
"
4 17 Stan "Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
"
4 17 Stan "Wow! Count me in!
"
4 1 Stan "We win again! 
"
4 1 Stan "Sleds are for guys.
"
4 1 Stan "Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
"
4 1 Stan "You got it!
"
4 1 Stan "Noo problem!
"
4 1 Stan "Oh, boy! We'll show them!
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
"
4 1 Stan "Hello?
"
4 1 Stan "Son of a bitch!
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
"
4 1 Stan "Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
"
4 1 Stan "Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
"
4 1 Stan "Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
"
4 1 Stan "Nice going, fat boy!
"
4 1 Stan "Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
"
4 1 Stan "Come on, let's get it a try. 
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah-
"
4 1 Stan "Dude, bail! Bail! 
"
4 1 Stan "Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
"
4 1 Stan "We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
"
4 1 Stan "Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
"
4 1 Stan "You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
"
4 1 Stan "That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
"
4 1 Stan "I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
"
4 1 Stan "Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
"
4 1 Stan "...Yeah.
"
4 1 Stan "Sshh! 
"
4 1 Stan "How are we supposed to give them to you?
"
4 1 Stan "But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, here. 
"
4 1 Stan "Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
"
4 1 Stan "That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
"
4 1 Stan "There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah. 
"
4 1 Stan "Hi. Can Token come out and play?
"
4 1 Stan "Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
"
4 1 Stan "It's not?
"
4 1 Stan "Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
"
4 1 Stan "Okay, go ahead and start.
"
4 1 Stan "Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
"
4 1 Stan "If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
"
4 1 Stan "Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
"
4 1 Stan "That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
"
4 1 Stan "Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
"
4 1 Stan "Alright, where's Clyde.
"
4 1 Stan "Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
"
4 1 Stan "It's Cartman!
"
4 1 Stan "All right! Let's do this!
"
4 1 Stan "Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
"
4 1 Stan "We're not gonna make it! 
"
4 1 Stan "We did it!
"
4 1 Stan "Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
"
4 2 Stan "What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
"
4 2 Stan "Two dollars!
"
4 2 Stan "For one tooth?
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
"
4 2 Stan "I already lost all my baby teeth.
"
4 2 Stan "Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
"
4 2 Stan "What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
"
4 2 Stan "Uh, Butters, could we have it?
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
"
4 2 Stan "I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
"
4 2 Stan "Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
"
4 2 Stan "Well?
"
4 2 Stan "Oh my God!
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, where's the money?
"
4 2 Stan "What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
"
4 2 Stan "Tell us what?!
"
4 2 Stan "Dude.
"
4 2 Stan "You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
"
4 2 Stan "Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
"
4 2 Stan "Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
"
4 2 Stan "So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
"
4 2 Stan "The kid will never even know.
"
4 2 Stan "We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"
4 2 Stan "Come on, Kyle! 
"
4 2 Stan "Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""
"
4 2 Stan "There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
"
4 2 Stan "This is the smartest business venture ever. 
"
4 2 Stan "Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
"
4 2 Stan "...Hey, you can't do that!
"
4 2 Stan "Because that's what we're doing!
"
4 2 Stan "You scram! We were here first!
"
4 2 Stan "You woke him up! 
"
4 2 Stan "Who's the Boss?
"
4 2 Stan "Uuh, yeah.
"
4 2 Stan "Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
"
4 2 Stan "Well, uh-what do you mean?
"
4 2 Stan "What's a ""tooth trade?""
"
4 2 Stan "Amazing.
"
4 2 Stan "Oh. Uh-I don't know.
"
4 2 Stan "How much do we get if we work for you?
"
4 2 Stan "We're in!
"
4 2 Stan "We all want double-desserts today!
"
4 2 Stan "U-uh, Chef.
"
4 2 Stan "Chef!
"
4 2 Stan "CHEF!
"
4 2 Stan "We're not dealing drugs!
"
4 2 Stan "No!
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
"
4 2 Stan "We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
"
4 2 Stan "Dude, just stop thinking about it.
"
4 2 Stan "Kyle?
"
4 2 Stan "Aw, shit.
"
4 2 Stan "What?
"
4 2 Stan "Really?
"
4 2 Stan "So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
"
4 3 Stan "Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
"
4 3 Stan "Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
"
4 3 Stan "Two hours.
"
4 3 Stan "Damn, dude. 
"
4 3 Stan "Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
"
4 3 Stan "Dude, this isn't working.
"
4 3 Stan "Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
"
4 3 Stan "I'm tired, Grandpa.
"
4 3 Stan "I don't know.  Whoa. 
"
4 3 Stan "Hurry up, you guys!
"
4 3 Stan "Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
"
4 3 Stan "Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
"
4 3 Stan "Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
"
4 3 Stan "Okay, hold it, hold it. 
"
4 3 Stan "What?!
"
4 3 Stan "Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
"
4 3 Stan "They have nowhere else to go.  Please?
"
4 3 Stan "That's your dad?
"
4 3 Stan "Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
"
4 3 Stan "No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
"
4 3 Stan "Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
"
4 3 Stan "No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
"
4 3 Stan "Now what do we do?
"
4 3 Stan "Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
"
4 3 Stan "The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah! Well, not this time!
"
4 3 Stan "We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
"
4 3 Stan "Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
"
4 3 Stan "Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"
4 3 Stan "Come on, angry mob! 
"
4 3 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 3 Stan "Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
"
4 3 Stan "Whatever happened to Kenny?
"
4 4 Stan "Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
"
4 4 Stan "I know!
"
4 4 Stan "Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
"
4 4 Stan "But he is-
"
4 4 Stan "He doesn't have to do homework?
"
4 4 Stan "I've got ADD.
"
4 4 Stan "Dude, it's Timmy.
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
"
4 4 Stan "But he's funny.
"
4 4 Stan "He looks pretty happy to me.
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
"
4 4 Stan "Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
"
4 4 Stan "Because we're on Ritalin.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh boy oh boy.
"
4 4 Stan "But there are no side effects, Chef.
"
4 4 Stan "See what?
"
4 4 Stan "Let's watch something else.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
"
4 4 Stan "Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
4 4 Stan "Sounds good.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
"
4 4 Stan "Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
"
4 4 Stan "Sure was, Dad.
"
4 4 Stan "Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 
"
4 4 Stan "I feel... different.
"
4 4 Stan "Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
"
4 4 Stan "Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
"
4 4 Stan "No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
"
4 6 Stan "Um, deny it?
"
4 6 Stan "Sweet.
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
"
4 6 Stan "You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
"
4 6 Stan "Oh, man, that's terrible.
"
4 6 Stan "Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.
"
4 6 Stan "Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
"
4 6 Stan "We're making faces at sick people.
"
4 6 Stan "We don't know.
"
4 6 Stan "You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
"
4 6 Stan "We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
"
4 6 Stan "Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
"
4 6 Stan "We got invited too, fatass!
"
4 6 Stan "This is boring.
"
4 6 Stan "That seems kind of... weird.
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 6 Stan "Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
"
4 6 Stan "Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! 
"
4 6 Stan "Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
"
4 6 Stan "Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
"
4 6 Stan "And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
"
4 7 Stan "Here! 
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, what the hell was that?
"
4 7 Stan "...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
"
4 7 Stan "You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
"
4 7 Stan "He's fakin'!
"
4 7 Stan "Now, that's a get-well card! 
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
"
4 7 Stan "Go on, Butters!
"
4 7 Stan "Butters, go on!
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you really are sick, huh?
"
4 7 Stan "Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
"
4 7 Stan "Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
"
4 7 Stan "What?
"
4 7 Stan "Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
"
4 7 Stan "Don't be a smartass?
"
4 7 Stan "Hi, doctor. 
"
4 7 Stan "Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
"
4 7 Stan "But I don't think it's working.
"
4 7 Stan "Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
"
4 7 Stan "...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
"
4 7 Stan "Who?  Oh, shit.
"
4 7 Stan "Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
"
4 7 Stan "Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
"
4 7 Stan "What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"
4 7 Stan "His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
"
4 7 Stan "Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
"
4 7 Stan "But you only need one, fat boy!
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
"
4 7 Stan "Oh my God!
"
4 7 Stan "Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
"
4 7 Stan "What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
"
4 7 Stan "Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
"
4 7 Stan "You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
"
4 7 Stan "Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
"
4 7 Stan "Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
"
4 7 Stan "And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"
4 7 Stan "Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
"
4 7 Stan "I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
"
4 7 Stan "I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
"
4 7 Stan "Come on, where are they? 
"
4 7 Stan "This is it??
"
4 7 Stan "This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
"
4 7 Stan "Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
"
4 7 Stan "We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 
"
4 7 Stan "Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
"
4 7 Stan "Sshhh!
"
4 7 Stan "If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
"
4 7 Stan "Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
"
4 7 Stan "Oh, phew.
"
4 7 Stan "Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
"
4 7 Stan "...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
"
4 7 Stan "You suck, Cartman!
"
4 7 Stan "God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
"
4 7 Stan "There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
"
4 7 Stan "My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
"
4 7 Stan "Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! 
"
4 7 Stan "So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
"
4 7 Stan "That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
"
4 7 Stan "Alright, alright, here. 
"
4 7 Stan "You look a lot better.
"
4 7 Stan "Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
"
4 7 Stan "Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
"
4 7 Stan "It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
"
4 7 Stan "Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
"
4 7 Stan "Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 
"
4 8 Stan "You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"
4 8 Stan "Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
"
4 8 Stan "Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
"
4 8 Stan "Islam??
"
4 8 Stan "Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
"
4 8 Stan "Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
"
4 8 Stan "But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
"
4 8 Stan "Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
"
4 8 Stan "I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
"
4 8 Stan "Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
"
4 8 Stan "Do you think they should change the flag?
"
4 8 Stan "That was a good one.
"
4 8 Stan "Wait, I don't get it.
"
4 9 Stan "Boy band?
"
4 9 Stan "Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
"
4 9 Stan "He's right.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, I guess.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
"
4 9 Stan "Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
"
4 9 Stan "Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
"
4 9 Stan "Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
"
4 9 Stan "Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
"
4 9 Stan "Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
"
4 9 Stan "Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
"
4 9 Stan "She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
"
4 9 Stan "Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
"
4 9 Stan "Costumes? 
"
4 9 Stan "Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"
4 9 Stan "Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?
"
4 9 Stan "Kenny says that's not what it means.
"
4 9 Stan "Uh oh, mall cops.
"
4 9 Stan "Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 9 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
4 9 Stan "We are making a music video.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I was just a--
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
"
4 9 Stan "No.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad!
"
4 9 Stan "It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
"
4 9 Stan "Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
"
4 9 Stan "I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
"
4 9 Stan "Dad? What the hell is going on?
"
4 9 Stan "Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
"
4 9 Stan "...Oh-kay.
"
4 9 Stan "Dad?
"
4 9 Stan "Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
4 9 Stan "Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
"
4 9 Stan "Really?
"
4 9 Stan "Alright! 
"
4 9 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
4 9 Stan "Oh, yes we do.
"
4 9 Stan "You were great, Dad.
"
4 9 Stan "Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
"
4 9 Stan "I don't think they sell those anymore. 
"
4 10 Stan "Bo-ring.
"
4 10 Stan "Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's...""
"
4 10 Stan """It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-""
"
4 10 Stan "Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
"
4 10 Stan "We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
"
4 10 Stan "Are we gonna go to hell?
"
4 10 Stan "What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
"
4 10 Stan "But crackers are his- body.
"
4 10 Stan "Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
"
4 10 Stan "No??
"
4 10 Stan "Confession? 
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
"
4 10 Stan "And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
"
4 10 Stan "We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
"
4 10 Stan "Have you confessed all your sins yet?
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
"
4 10 Stan "Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
"
4 10 Stan "What, Butters?
"
4 10 Stan "Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
"
4 10 Stan "I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"
4 10 Stan "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
"
4 10 Stan "Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
"
4 10 Stan "The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
"
4 10 Stan "I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
"
4 10 Stan "...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
"
4 10 Stan "God damnit!
"
4 10 Stan "Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
"
4 10 Stan "We have a question.
"
4 10 Stan "Where do handicapped people go when they die?
"
4 10 Stan "But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
"
4 10 Stan "What happened??
"
4 10 Stan "I don't think so.
"
4 10 Stan "Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
"
4 10 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!
"
4 10 Stan "Oh, shit!  Oh!
"
4 10 Stan "But what about them?
"
4 10 Stan "Okay, come on. 
"
4 10 Stan "Come on! This stupid light won't change.
"
4 10 Stan "We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
"
4 10 Stan "Uh, come on, let's go. 
"
4 10 Stan "...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 10 Stan "He's doomed.
"
4 10 Stan "Oh no! It's locked!
"
4 10 Stan "Confession box is over there! 
"
4 10 Stan "You're a sinner!
"
4 10 Stan "Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4 10 Stan "Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 
"
4 11 Stan "Let's go. 
"
4 11 Stan "...they've killed Kenny!
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4 11 Stan "Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
"
4 11 Stan "What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
"
4 11 Stan "There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"
4 11 Stan "Wow, cool.
"
4 11 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 11 Stan "What?
"
4 11 Stan "Kenny?!  What's he say?
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
"
4 11 Stan "What worked?
"
4 11 Stan "Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
"
4 11 Stan "Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
"
4 11 Stan "Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
"
4 11 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 12 Stan "Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
"
4 12 Stan "What grade are you going into?
"
4 12 Stan "Stupid third grader!
"
4 12 Stan "Denver? 
"
4 12 Stan "Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
"
4 12 Stan "Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!
"
4 12 Stan "...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
"
4 12 Stan "Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!""
"
4 12 Stan "We got you covered, Timmy.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
"
4 12 Stan "...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
"
4 12 Stan "What a bitch!
"
4 12 Stan "This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
"
4 12 Stan "Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
"
4 12 Stan "We travel back in time.
"
4 12 Stan "It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
"
4 12 Stan "We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
"
4 12 Stan "Back in the third grade.
"
4 12 Stan "Oh! Here she comes.
"
4 12 Stan "Yeah!
"
4 12 Stan "Timmy, you have to stop!
"
4 12 Stan "No??
"
4 12 Stan "So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
"
4 12 Stan "My God!
"
4 12 Stan "Over here, over here!
"
4 12 Stan "Less than 20 minutes?!
"
4 12 Stan "Well, who didn't see that coming?
"
4 12 Stan "...nine, eight...
"
4 12 Stan "Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
"
4 12 Stan "W-what did you get in a fight about?
"
4 12 Stan "Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
"
4 12 Stan "Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
"
4 12 Stan "God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
"
4 12 Stan "I know.
"
4 12 Stan "Wait a minute! I've got it. 
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
"
4 12 Stan "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
4 12 Stan "Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
"
4 12 Stan "Dude. Sh-she's right.
"
4 12 Stan "Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
"
4 12 Stan "Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
"
4 13 Stan "Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
"
4 13 Stan "But isn't he only three years old?
"
4 13 Stan "Cool!
"
4 13 Stan "Wow, cool!
"
4 13 Stan "Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
"
4 13 Stan "But they smell like pee.
"
4 13 Stan "Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"
4 13 Stan "Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
"
4 13 Stan "Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
"
4 13 Stan "Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4 13 Stan "What the hell just happened?
"
4 13 Stan "Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
"
4 13 Stan "Wow, that's amazing.
"
4 13 Stan "What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
"
4 13 Stan "Yes!
"
4 13 Stan "So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"
4 13 Stan "Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 13 Stan "Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!
"
4 13 Stan "Can I do it?
"
4 13 Stan "Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
"
4 13 Stan "Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
"
4 13 Stan "He's right there.
"
4 13 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
4 13 Stan "Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
"
4 13 Stan "Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
"
4 13 Stan "You break it down!
"
4 13 Stan "Not it! You lose, Kenny. 
"
4 13 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 13 Stan "Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman, you have to stop!
"
4 13 Stan "He is in there.
"
4 13 Stan "One-two-three, not it!
"
4 13 Stan "Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
"
4 13 Stan "No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
"
4 13 Stan "This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
"
4 13 Stan "He did it!
"
4 13 Stan "You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
"
4 13 Stan "Huh, that's a bitch.
"
4 13 Stan "Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
"
4 13 Stan "Cartman!
"
4 14 Stan "'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
"
4 14 Stan "E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
"
4 14 Stan "'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
"
4 14 Stan "Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
"
4 14 Stan "Oh yeah, we can't!
"
4 14 Stan "You do?
"
4 14 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4 14 Stan "No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
"
4 14 Stan "Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
"
4 14 Stan "No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
"
4 14 Stan "Helen!
"
4 14 Stan "Oh no! 
"
4 14 Stan "Okay, here we go. 
"
4 14 Stan "We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
"
4 15 Stan "I can't do it, dude.
"
4 15 Stan "Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
"
4 15 Stan "That's so gross.
"
4 15 Stan "I'll throw in five.
"
4 15 Stan "forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
"
4 15 Stan "Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
"
4 15 Stan "Well, at least you got it out of your system.
"
4 15 Stan "Oh, you guys!
"
4 15 Stan "You know, dude, there might be something to this.
"
4 15 Stan "We knew he wouldn't make it.
"
4 15 Stan "I don't believe it.
"
4 15 Stan "Did you like the old one?
"
4 15 Stan "We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
"
4 15 Stan "What's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4 15 Stan "Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
"
4 15 Stan "Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
"
4 15 Stan "Like what?
"
4 15 Stan "No.
"
4 15 Stan "Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
"
4 15 Stan "Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
"
4 15 Stan "You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
"
4 15 Stan "For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
"
4 15 Stan "I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
"
4 15 Stan "I know! 
"
4 15 Stan "Deal, druggie!
"
4 15 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
"
4 16 Stan "Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
"
4 16 Stan "We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
"
4 16 Stan "Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
"
4 16 Stan "Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
"
4 16 Stan "The police?
"
4 16 Stan "But what do the police do to them?
"
4 16 Stan "Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
"
4 16 Stan "What's going on?
"
4 16 Stan "...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
"
4 16 Stan "You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
"
4 16 Stan "How come you wanna help the fatass?!
"
4 16 Stan "You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
"
4 16 Stan "You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
"
4 16 Stan "If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
"
4 16 Stan "Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
"
4 16 Stan "Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
"
4 16 Stan "And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
"
4 16 Stan "Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
"
4 16 Stan "The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
"
4 16 Stan "So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
"
4 16 Stan "We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
"
4 16 Stan "Yes. No foolies.
"
4 16 Stan "Awesu-home!
"
4 16 Stan "No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
"
4 16 Stan "It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
"
4 16 Stan "Parents?
"
4 16 Stan "He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
"
4 16 Stan "Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
"
4 16 Stan "Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
"
4 16 Stan "Hey, you guys came back!
"
4 16 Stan "Huh.
"
4 16 Stan "I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
"
4 17 Stan "A-ah huh.
"
4 17 Stan "Ho-o-oh.
"
4 17 Stan "What is this all about, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
"
4 17 Stan "Nobody's paying any attention. 
"
4 17 Stan "This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
"
4 17 Stan "Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
"
4 17 Stan "How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
"
4 17 Stan "And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
"
4 17 Stan "What, dude?
"
4 17 Stan "We don't know anything about animation.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" 
"
4 17 Stan "It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
"
4 17 Stan "That's not me, that's you!
"
4 17 Stan "No, that's okay. 
"
4 17 Stan "Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
"
4 17 Stan "Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4 17 Stan "Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
"
4 17 Stan "You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
"
4 17 Stan "What's awesome?
"
4 17 Stan "That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
"
4 17 Stan "Easy.
"
4 17 Stan "Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
"
4 17 Stan "Okay.  One.
"
4 17 Stan "Kickass!
"
4 17 Stan "Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
"
4 17 Stan "E mouths...
"
4 17 Stan "1  2.
"
4 17 Stan """We wish you a m- Merry""
"
4 17 Stan "AAAAAAAA!
"
4 17 Stan "That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
"
4 17 Stan "We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
"
4 17 Stan "Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
"
4 17 Stan "We love
"
4 17 Stan "Tralala
"
4 17 Stan "We sit.
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan """Awgh! I'm so fat!""
"
4 17 Stan """Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""
"
4 17 Stan "Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
"
4 17 Stan "Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
"
4 17 Stan "We wish
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan "We sit.
"
4 17 Stan "Tralalalala
"
4 17 Stan "...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
"
4 17 Stan "Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4 17 Stan "Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
"
4 17 Stan "You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
"
4 17 Stan "For nothing.
"
4 17 Stan "Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
"
4 17 Stan "No not ham!
"
4 17 Stan "...Christmas is about something much more important!
"
4 17 Stan "Presents.
"
4 17 Stan "Don't you see, Kyle?
"
4 17 Stan "Presents.
"
4 17 Stan "Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
"
4 17 Stan "Wow! Count me in!
"
