16 1 Cartman "Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Of course, man. It's cool.
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
16 1 Cartman "I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
16 1 Cartman "His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
16 1 Cartman "I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
16 1 Cartman "They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
16 1 Cartman "Mom, get the door! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Who are these buttholes?
"
16 1 Cartman "My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
16 1 Cartman "This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
16 1 Cartman "What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
16 1 Cartman "Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
16 1 Cartman "Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
"
16 1 Cartman "Oh boy, here we go.
"
16 1 Cartman "So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
16 1 Cartman "Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
16 2 Cartman "Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
"
16 2 Cartman "No, dude, it's... badass.
"
16 2 Cartman "...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
16 2 Cartman "You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
16 2 Cartman "I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
"
16 2 Cartman "This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
16 2 Cartman "For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
16 2 Cartman "That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
16 2 Cartman "Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
"
16 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck?!
"
16 2 Cartman """My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
16 2 Cartman "We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
16 2 Cartman "YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
"
16 2 Cartman "Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
16 2 Cartman "Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
"
16 2 Cartman "Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
"
16 2 Cartman "Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
16 2 Cartman "Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
16 2 Cartman "I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
"
16 2 Cartman "And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
16 2 Cartman "How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
16 2 Cartman "What d'ja say?
"
16 2 Cartman "Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
16 2 Cartman "Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
16 2 Cartman "You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
16 2 Cartman "You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
16 2 Cartman "-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
16 2 Cartman "No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
16 3 Cartman "I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
16 3 Cartman "Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, God. That was boring.
"
16 3 Cartman "Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
16 3 Cartman "Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
16 3 Cartman "Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
16 3 Cartman "Really? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Yes!
"
16 3 Cartman "What's it say, what's it say?
"
16 3 Cartman "What? Let me see that. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
16 3 Cartman "You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
16 3 Cartman "How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
16 3 Cartman "Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
16 3 Cartman "Why don't you make me? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
16 3 Cartman "I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
16 3 Cartman "Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
16 3 Cartman "Dude, what's going on?
"
16 3 Cartman "Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on, Kyle.
"
16 3 Cartman "It's okay, man, come on.
"
16 3 Cartman "Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I know. I know Kyle. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
16 3 Cartman "And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
16 3 Cartman "No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
"
16 3 Cartman "No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
16 3 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
16 3 Cartman "SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
16 3 Cartman "Let's do this. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
16 3 Cartman "We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
16 3 Cartman "Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
16 4 Cartman "Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
16 4 Cartman "So interesting, wow. 
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
"
16 4 Cartman "Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
16 4 Cartman "All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
16 4 Cartman "Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
16 4 Cartman "Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
"
16 4 Cartman "Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
"
16 4 Cartman "You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
16 4 Cartman "JESUS IS A LIE!
"
16 4 Cartman "Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
16 4 Cartman "No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
"
16 4 Cartman "Sh! You hear that?
"
16 4 Cartman "I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
16 4 Cartman "It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
16 4 Cartman "I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
16 4 Cartman "We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
16 4 Cartman "That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
16 4 Cartman "Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
16 4 Cartman "People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
16 4 Cartman "These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
16 4 Cartman "I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
16 4 Cartman "Heh. What do you mean? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
16 4 Cartman "Why?
"
16 4 Cartman "There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
16 4 Cartman "Guys?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
16 4 Cartman "What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
16 4 Cartman "It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
16 4 Cartman "Wingstreet?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
16 4 Cartman "HUH?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
16 4 Cartman "OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
16 4 Cartman "This isn't safe or fun!
"
16 4 Cartman "NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
16 4 Cartman "Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what... where...
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
16 4 Cartman "It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
16 4 Cartman "What does that mean?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
16 4 Cartman "You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
16 4 Cartman "But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
16 4 Cartman "I love you, dad.
"
16 4 Cartman "And our love grows
"
16 4 Cartman "Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
16 4 Cartman "No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
16 4 Cartman "We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
16 4 Cartman "Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
16 4 Cartman "I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
"
16 4 Cartman "Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
16 5 Cartman "Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
16 5 Cartman "He has a point.
"
16 5 Cartman "I have balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Still balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
16 5 Cartman "My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
"
16 5 Cartman "'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
16 5 Cartman "We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
16 5 Cartman "The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "Somebody help us! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Kyle, hurry! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Oh God!
"
16 6 Cartman "Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
16 6 Cartman "No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
16 6 Cartman "Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
16 6 Cartman "Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
16 6 Cartman "Alright!
"
16 6 Cartman "Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
16 6 Cartman "...No.
"
16 6 Cartman "Finally!
"
16 6 Cartman "Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Mmmm, no?
"
16 6 Cartman "The trees' biology?
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "Zipliiine. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
16 6 Cartman """The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm so fucking bored! 
"
16 6 Cartman "We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
16 6 Cartman "I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
16 6 Cartman "Fuck you Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "Nnnn-mo...
"
16 6 Cartman "Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
"
16 6 Cartman "This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
16 6 Cartman "If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOO! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Eeeeugh.
"
16 6 Cartman "Uh oh. 
"
16 6 Cartman "A marina?
"
16 6 Cartman "Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
16 6 Cartman "Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
16 6 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
"
16 6 Cartman "No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
"
16 6 Cartman "You?!
"
16 6 Cartman "You... You killed Kenny! 
"
16 6 Cartman "It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
16 6 Cartman "You came for us!
"
16 6 Cartman "We were saved. It was over.
"
16 6 Cartman "No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
16 6 Cartman "It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
16 7 Cartman "What?
"
16 7 Cartman "Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
16 7 Cartman "What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
16 7 Cartman "...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
16 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
16 7 Cartman "Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
16 7 Cartman "Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
16 7 Cartman "Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
16 7 Cartman "W-yeah, of course. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
16 7 Cartman "Thanks, you guys.
"
16 7 Cartman "WHAT?! KYLE?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Motherfucker! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
16 7 Cartman "Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
"
16 7 Cartman "Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
16 7 Cartman "Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
"
16 7 Cartman "No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
16 7 Cartman "Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
16 7 Cartman "Ohhhhh my God.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
"
16 7 Cartman "Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
16 7 Cartman "Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nothing.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nobody.
"
16 7 Cartman "Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
16 7 Cartman "That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I'm gonna get you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I almost got you! Almost! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
16 7 Cartman "It's not fair! They were so... happy!
"
16 7 Cartman "It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
"
16 7 Cartman "And you! I should never have believed in you!
"
16 7 Cartman "I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
16 7 Cartman "Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
16 7 Cartman "Denver Nuggets game?
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooooooo!
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO. 
"
16 7 Cartman "No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
16 7 Cartman "Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
16 7 Cartman "I swear, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
16 7 Cartman "Really?!
"
16 7 Cartman "What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, stop it!
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooo!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's right, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's true.
"
16 8 Cartman "Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
16 8 Cartman "Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
16 8 Cartman "Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
16 8 Cartman "I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
16 8 Cartman "No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "...I don't have a dad.
"
16 8 Cartman "Youuu save it all?
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
16 8 Cartman "Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
16 8 Cartman "Holy shit I think I do.
"
16 8 Cartman "That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
16 8 Cartman "That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
16 9 Cartman "See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
16 9 Cartman "I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
16 9 Cartman "No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
16 9 Cartman "Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
16 9 Cartman "That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
16 9 Cartman "Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
"
16 9 Cartman "And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
16 9 Cartman "What, Kyle?! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
16 9 Cartman "It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
16 9 Cartman "Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
16 9 Cartman "What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
16 9 Cartman "I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, no way!
"
16 10 Cartman "Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
16 10 Cartman "Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh no, really?
"
16 10 Cartman "Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
16 10 Cartman "What-what do you mean?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
16 10 Cartman "Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Sorry about this.
"
16 10 Cartman "'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
16 10 Cartman "That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
16 10 Cartman "I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
16 10 Cartman "You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
16 10 Cartman "He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
16 10 Cartman "Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Who is there?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
16 10 Cartman "Heh- hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
16 10 Cartman "HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
"
16 10 Cartman "What?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "My password is uloveboobs!
"
16 10 Cartman "You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
16 10 Cartman "God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
16 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
16 11 Cartman "FELLAS! Fellas!
"
16 11 Cartman "You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
16 11 Cartman "It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
16 11 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
16 11 Cartman "Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
16 11 Cartman "...Wow.
"
16 11 Cartman "Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
16 11 Cartman "Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
16 11 Cartman "He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
16 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
16 12 Cartman "We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
16 12 Cartman "Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
16 12 Cartman "Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
"
16 12 Cartman "You'll just have to wait and see.
"
16 12 Cartman "Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
"
16 12 Cartman "This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
16 12 Cartman "I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
"
16 12 Cartman "The Incredible...
"
16 12 Cartman "No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
"
16 12 Cartman "The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
"
16 12 Cartman "JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
"
16 12 Cartman "That's right!
"
16 12 Cartman "Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
16 12 Cartman "You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Cartman SMASH! 
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
16 12 Cartman "Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
16 13 Cartman "I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
16 13 Cartman "All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
16 13 Cartman "Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
16 13 Cartman "Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
16 13 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
16 13 Cartman "The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
16 13 Cartman "Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
16 13 Cartman "Craig?! You asshole!
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
16 13 Cartman "...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
"
16 13 Cartman "...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
16 14 Cartman "MOM!
"
16 14 Cartman "She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Where's my mom?
"
16 14 Cartman """Warm nuts"", she said.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
16 14 Cartman "No way dude. No way.
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
16 14 Cartman "Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
16 14 Cartman "Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
16 14 Cartman "Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
"
16 14 Cartman "You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
16 14 Cartman "What if I did, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Pretty sweet, huh?
"
16 14 Cartman "What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
16 14 Cartman "No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
"
16 14 Cartman "Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
"
16 14 Cartman "Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
16 14 Cartman "Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
16 14 Cartman "Hmmm, no.
"
16 14 Cartman "I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
16 14 Cartman "Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
16 14 Cartman "I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
16 14 Cartman "I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
16 14 Cartman "But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
16 14 Cartman "They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
16 14 Cartman "So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
16 14 Cartman "Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
16 14 Cartman "I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
16 14 Cartman "Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
16 14 Cartman "Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
16 14 Cartman "I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
16 14 Cartman "I want a part in the new movies!
"
16 14 Cartman "I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
16 14 Cartman "Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha. 
"
16 14 Cartman "I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Of course, man. It's cool.
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
16 1 Cartman "I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
16 1 Cartman "His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
16 1 Cartman "I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
16 1 Cartman "They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
16 1 Cartman "Mom, get the door! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Who are these buttholes?
"
16 1 Cartman "My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
16 1 Cartman "This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
16 1 Cartman "What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
16 1 Cartman "Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
16 1 Cartman "Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
"
16 1 Cartman "Oh boy, here we go.
"
16 1 Cartman "So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
16 1 Cartman "Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
16 2 Cartman "Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
"
16 2 Cartman "No, dude, it's... badass.
"
16 2 Cartman "...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
16 2 Cartman "You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
16 2 Cartman "I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
"
16 2 Cartman "This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
16 2 Cartman "For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
16 2 Cartman "That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
16 2 Cartman "Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
"
16 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck?!
"
16 2 Cartman """My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
16 2 Cartman "We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
16 2 Cartman "YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
"
16 2 Cartman "Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
16 2 Cartman "Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
"
16 2 Cartman "Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
"
16 2 Cartman "Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
16 2 Cartman "Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
16 2 Cartman "I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
"
16 2 Cartman "And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
16 2 Cartman "How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
16 2 Cartman "What d'ja say?
"
16 2 Cartman "Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
16 2 Cartman "Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
16 2 Cartman "You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
16 2 Cartman "You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
16 2 Cartman "-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
16 2 Cartman "No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
16 3 Cartman "I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
16 3 Cartman "Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, God. That was boring.
"
16 3 Cartman "Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
16 3 Cartman "Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
16 3 Cartman "Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
16 3 Cartman "Really? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Yes!
"
16 3 Cartman "What's it say, what's it say?
"
16 3 Cartman "What? Let me see that. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
16 3 Cartman "You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
16 3 Cartman "How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
16 3 Cartman "Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
16 3 Cartman "Why don't you make me? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
16 3 Cartman "I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
16 3 Cartman "Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
16 3 Cartman "Dude, what's going on?
"
16 3 Cartman "Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on, Kyle.
"
16 3 Cartman "It's okay, man, come on.
"
16 3 Cartman "Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I know. I know Kyle. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
16 3 Cartman "And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
16 3 Cartman "No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
"
16 3 Cartman "No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
16 3 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
16 3 Cartman "SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
16 3 Cartman "Let's do this. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
16 3 Cartman "We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
16 3 Cartman "Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
16 4 Cartman "Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
16 4 Cartman "So interesting, wow. 
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
"
16 4 Cartman "Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
16 4 Cartman "All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
16 4 Cartman "Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
16 4 Cartman "Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
"
16 4 Cartman "Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
"
16 4 Cartman "You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
16 4 Cartman "JESUS IS A LIE!
"
16 4 Cartman "Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
16 4 Cartman "No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
"
16 4 Cartman "Sh! You hear that?
"
16 4 Cartman "I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
16 4 Cartman "It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
16 4 Cartman "I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
16 4 Cartman "We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
16 4 Cartman "That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
16 4 Cartman "Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
16 4 Cartman "People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
16 4 Cartman "These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
16 4 Cartman "I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
16 4 Cartman "Heh. What do you mean? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
16 4 Cartman "Why?
"
16 4 Cartman "There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
16 4 Cartman "Guys?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
16 4 Cartman "What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
16 4 Cartman "It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
16 4 Cartman "Wingstreet?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
16 4 Cartman "HUH?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
16 4 Cartman "OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
16 4 Cartman "This isn't safe or fun!
"
16 4 Cartman "NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
16 4 Cartman "Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what... where...
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
16 4 Cartman "It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
16 4 Cartman "What does that mean?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
16 4 Cartman "You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
16 4 Cartman "But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
16 4 Cartman "I love you, dad.
"
16 4 Cartman "And our love grows
"
16 4 Cartman "Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
16 4 Cartman "No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
16 4 Cartman "We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
16 4 Cartman "Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
16 4 Cartman "I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
"
16 4 Cartman "Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
16 5 Cartman "Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
16 5 Cartman "He has a point.
"
16 5 Cartman "I have balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Still balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
16 5 Cartman "My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
"
16 5 Cartman "'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
16 5 Cartman "We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
16 5 Cartman "The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "Somebody help us! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Kyle, hurry! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Oh God!
"
16 6 Cartman "Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
16 6 Cartman "No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
16 6 Cartman "Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
16 6 Cartman "Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
16 6 Cartman "Alright!
"
16 6 Cartman "Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
16 6 Cartman "...No.
"
16 6 Cartman "Finally!
"
16 6 Cartman "Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Mmmm, no?
"
16 6 Cartman "The trees' biology?
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "Zipliiine. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
16 6 Cartman """The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm so fucking bored! 
"
16 6 Cartman "We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
16 6 Cartman "I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
16 6 Cartman "Fuck you Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "Nnnn-mo...
"
16 6 Cartman "Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
"
16 6 Cartman "This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
16 6 Cartman "If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOO! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Eeeeugh.
"
16 6 Cartman "Uh oh. 
"
16 6 Cartman "A marina?
"
16 6 Cartman "Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
16 6 Cartman "Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
16 6 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
"
16 6 Cartman "No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
"
16 6 Cartman "You?!
"
16 6 Cartman "You... You killed Kenny! 
"
16 6 Cartman "It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
16 6 Cartman "You came for us!
"
16 6 Cartman "We were saved. It was over.
"
16 6 Cartman "No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
16 6 Cartman "It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
16 7 Cartman "What?
"
16 7 Cartman "Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
16 7 Cartman "What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
16 7 Cartman "...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
16 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
16 7 Cartman "Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
16 7 Cartman "Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
16 7 Cartman "Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
16 7 Cartman "W-yeah, of course. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
16 7 Cartman "Thanks, you guys.
"
16 7 Cartman "WHAT?! KYLE?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Motherfucker! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
16 7 Cartman "Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
"
16 7 Cartman "Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
16 7 Cartman "Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
"
16 7 Cartman "No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
16 7 Cartman "Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
16 7 Cartman "Ohhhhh my God.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
"
16 7 Cartman "Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
16 7 Cartman "Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nothing.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nobody.
"
16 7 Cartman "Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
16 7 Cartman "That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I'm gonna get you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I almost got you! Almost! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
16 7 Cartman "It's not fair! They were so... happy!
"
16 7 Cartman "It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
"
16 7 Cartman "And you! I should never have believed in you!
"
16 7 Cartman "I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
16 7 Cartman "Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
16 7 Cartman "Denver Nuggets game?
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooooooo!
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO. 
"
16 7 Cartman "No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
16 7 Cartman "Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
16 7 Cartman "I swear, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
16 7 Cartman "Really?!
"
16 7 Cartman "What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, stop it!
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooo!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's right, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's true.
"
16 8 Cartman "Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
16 8 Cartman "Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
16 8 Cartman "Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
16 8 Cartman "I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
16 8 Cartman "No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "...I don't have a dad.
"
16 8 Cartman "Youuu save it all?
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
16 8 Cartman "Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
16 8 Cartman "Holy shit I think I do.
"
16 8 Cartman "That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
16 8 Cartman "That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
16 9 Cartman "See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
16 9 Cartman "I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
16 9 Cartman "No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
16 9 Cartman "Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
16 9 Cartman "That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
16 9 Cartman "Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
"
16 9 Cartman "And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
16 9 Cartman "What, Kyle?! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
16 9 Cartman "It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
16 9 Cartman "Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
16 9 Cartman "What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
16 9 Cartman "I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, no way!
"
16 10 Cartman "Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
16 10 Cartman "Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh no, really?
"
16 10 Cartman "Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
16 10 Cartman "What-what do you mean?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
16 10 Cartman "Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Sorry about this.
"
16 10 Cartman "'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
16 10 Cartman "That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
16 10 Cartman "I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
16 10 Cartman "You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
16 10 Cartman "He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
16 10 Cartman "Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Who is there?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
16 10 Cartman "Heh- hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
16 10 Cartman "HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
"
16 10 Cartman "What?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "My password is uloveboobs!
"
16 10 Cartman "You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
16 10 Cartman "God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
16 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
16 11 Cartman "FELLAS! Fellas!
"
16 11 Cartman "You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
16 11 Cartman "It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
16 11 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
16 11 Cartman "Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
16 11 Cartman "...Wow.
"
16 11 Cartman "Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
16 11 Cartman "Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
16 11 Cartman "He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
16 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
16 12 Cartman "We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
16 12 Cartman "Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
16 12 Cartman "Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
"
16 12 Cartman "You'll just have to wait and see.
"
16 12 Cartman "Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
"
16 12 Cartman "This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
16 12 Cartman "I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
"
16 12 Cartman "The Incredible...
"
16 12 Cartman "No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
"
16 12 Cartman "The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
"
16 12 Cartman "JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
"
16 12 Cartman "That's right!
"
16 12 Cartman "Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
16 12 Cartman "You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Cartman SMASH! 
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
16 12 Cartman "Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
16 13 Cartman "I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
16 13 Cartman "All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
16 13 Cartman "Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
16 13 Cartman "Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
16 13 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
16 13 Cartman "The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
16 13 Cartman "Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
16 13 Cartman "Craig?! You asshole!
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
16 13 Cartman "...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
"
16 13 Cartman "...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
16 14 Cartman "MOM!
"
16 14 Cartman "She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Where's my mom?
"
16 14 Cartman """Warm nuts"", she said.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
16 14 Cartman "No way dude. No way.
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
16 14 Cartman "Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
16 14 Cartman "Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
16 14 Cartman "Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
"
16 14 Cartman "You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
16 14 Cartman "What if I did, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Pretty sweet, huh?
"
16 14 Cartman "What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
16 14 Cartman "No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
"
16 14 Cartman "Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
"
16 14 Cartman "Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
16 14 Cartman "Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
16 14 Cartman "Hmmm, no.
"
16 14 Cartman "I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
16 14 Cartman "Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
16 14 Cartman "I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
16 14 Cartman "I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
16 14 Cartman "But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
16 14 Cartman "They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
16 14 Cartman "So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
16 14 Cartman "Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
16 14 Cartman "I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
16 14 Cartman "Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
16 14 Cartman "Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
16 14 Cartman "I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
16 14 Cartman "I want a part in the new movies!
"
16 14 Cartman "I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
16 14 Cartman "Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha. 
"
16 14 Cartman "I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Of course, man. It's cool.
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
16 1 Cartman "I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
16 1 Cartman "His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
16 1 Cartman "I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16 1 Cartman "Nuh-uh.
"
16 1 Cartman "They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
16 1 Cartman "Mom, get the door! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Who are these buttholes?
"
16 1 Cartman "My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
16 1 Cartman "Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
16 1 Cartman "This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
16 1 Cartman "Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
16 1 Cartman "What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
16 1 Cartman "Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
16 1 Cartman "Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
16 1 Cartman "Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 1 Cartman "That's right.
"
16 1 Cartman "Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
"
16 1 Cartman "Oh boy, here we go.
"
16 1 Cartman "So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
16 1 Cartman "Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
16 1 Cartman "Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
16 2 Cartman "Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
"
16 2 Cartman "No, dude, it's... badass.
"
16 2 Cartman "...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
16 2 Cartman "You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
16 2 Cartman "I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
"
16 2 Cartman "This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
16 2 Cartman "For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
16 2 Cartman "That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
16 2 Cartman "Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
"
16 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck?!
"
16 2 Cartman """My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
16 2 Cartman "We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
16 2 Cartman "YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
"
16 2 Cartman "Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
16 2 Cartman "Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
"
16 2 Cartman "Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
16 2 Cartman "Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
"
16 2 Cartman "Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
16 2 Cartman "Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
16 2 Cartman "I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
"
16 2 Cartman "Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
"
16 2 Cartman "And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
16 2 Cartman "How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
16 2 Cartman "What d'ja say?
"
16 2 Cartman "Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
16 2 Cartman "Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
16 2 Cartman "Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
16 2 Cartman "You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
16 2 Cartman "You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
16 2 Cartman "-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
16 2 Cartman "No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
16 3 Cartman "I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
16 3 Cartman "Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
16 3 Cartman "Oh, God. That was boring.
"
16 3 Cartman "Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
16 3 Cartman "Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
16 3 Cartman "Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
16 3 Cartman "Really? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Yes!
"
16 3 Cartman "What's it say, what's it say?
"
16 3 Cartman "What? Let me see that. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
16 3 Cartman "You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
16 3 Cartman "How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
16 3 Cartman "Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
16 3 Cartman "Why don't you make me? 
"
16 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
16 3 Cartman "I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
16 3 Cartman "Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
16 3 Cartman "Dude, what's going on?
"
16 3 Cartman "Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on, Kyle.
"
16 3 Cartman "It's okay, man, come on.
"
16 3 Cartman "Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I know. I know Kyle. 
"
16 3 Cartman "I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
16 3 Cartman "And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
16 3 Cartman "No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
"
16 3 Cartman "No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
"
16 3 Cartman "Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
16 3 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
16 3 Cartman "SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
16 3 Cartman "Let's do this. 
"
16 3 Cartman "No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
16 3 Cartman "Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
16 3 Cartman "We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
"
16 3 Cartman "Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
16 3 Cartman "Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
16 4 Cartman "Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
16 4 Cartman "So interesting, wow. 
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
"
16 4 Cartman "Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
16 4 Cartman "All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
16 4 Cartman "Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
16 4 Cartman "Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
16 4 Cartman "Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
16 4 Cartman "Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
"
16 4 Cartman "Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
"
16 4 Cartman "You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
16 4 Cartman "JESUS IS A LIE!
"
16 4 Cartman "Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
"
16 4 Cartman "Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
16 4 Cartman "No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
"
16 4 Cartman "Sh! You hear that?
"
16 4 Cartman "I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
16 4 Cartman "It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
16 4 Cartman "I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
16 4 Cartman "We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
16 4 Cartman "That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
16 4 Cartman "Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
16 4 Cartman "People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
16 4 Cartman "These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
16 4 Cartman "I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
16 4 Cartman "Heh. What do you mean? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
16 4 Cartman "Why?
"
16 4 Cartman "There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
16 4 Cartman "Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
16 4 Cartman "Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
16 4 Cartman "Guys?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
16 4 Cartman "What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
16 4 Cartman "It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
16 4 Cartman "Wingstreet?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
16 4 Cartman "HUH?!
"
16 4 Cartman "Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
16 4 Cartman "OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
16 4 Cartman "This isn't safe or fun!
"
16 4 Cartman "NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
16 4 Cartman "Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
16 4 Cartman "Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
16 4 Cartman "It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what... where...
"
16 4 Cartman "Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
16 4 Cartman "It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
16 4 Cartman "What does that mean?
"
16 4 Cartman "Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
16 4 Cartman "You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
16 4 Cartman "But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
16 4 Cartman "Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
16 4 Cartman "But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
16 4 Cartman "I love you, dad.
"
16 4 Cartman "And our love grows
"
16 4 Cartman "Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
16 4 Cartman "No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "Noooo! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
16 4 Cartman "We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
16 4 Cartman "No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
16 4 Cartman "I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
16 4 Cartman "Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
16 4 Cartman "I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
"
16 4 Cartman "Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
16 5 Cartman "Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
16 5 Cartman "He has a point.
"
16 5 Cartman "I have balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Still balls.
"
16 5 Cartman "Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
16 5 Cartman "My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
"
16 5 Cartman "'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
16 5 Cartman "We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
16 5 Cartman "The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "Somebody help us! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Kyle, hurry! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Oh God!
"
16 6 Cartman "Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
16 6 Cartman "No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
16 6 Cartman "Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
16 6 Cartman "Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
16 6 Cartman "Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
16 6 Cartman "Alright!
"
16 6 Cartman "Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
16 6 Cartman "...No.
"
16 6 Cartman "Finally!
"
16 6 Cartman "Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Mmmm, no?
"
16 6 Cartman "The trees' biology?
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah.
"
16 6 Cartman "Zipliiine. 
"
16 6 Cartman "Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
16 6 Cartman """The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOOO!
"
16 6 Cartman "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm so fucking bored! 
"
16 6 Cartman "We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
16 6 Cartman "Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
16 6 Cartman "I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
16 6 Cartman "Fuck you Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "Nnnn-mo...
"
16 6 Cartman "Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
"
16 6 Cartman "This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
16 6 Cartman "If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
16 6 Cartman "NOOO! 
"
16 6 Cartman "Eeeeugh.
"
16 6 Cartman "Uh oh. 
"
16 6 Cartman "A marina?
"
16 6 Cartman "Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
16 6 Cartman "Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
16 6 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16 6 Cartman "I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
"
16 6 Cartman "No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
"
16 6 Cartman "You?!
"
16 6 Cartman "You... You killed Kenny! 
"
16 6 Cartman "It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
16 6 Cartman "You came for us!
"
16 6 Cartman "We were saved. It was over.
"
16 6 Cartman "No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
16 6 Cartman "It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
16 7 Cartman "What?
"
16 7 Cartman "Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
16 7 Cartman "What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
16 7 Cartman "...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
16 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
16 7 Cartman "Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
16 7 Cartman "Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
16 7 Cartman "Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
16 7 Cartman "W-yeah, of course. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
16 7 Cartman "Thanks, you guys.
"
16 7 Cartman "WHAT?! KYLE?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Motherfucker! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
16 7 Cartman "Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
16 7 Cartman "Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
"
16 7 Cartman "Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
16 7 Cartman "Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
"
16 7 Cartman "No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
16 7 Cartman "Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
16 7 Cartman "Ohhhhh my God.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
"
16 7 Cartman "Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
"
16 7 Cartman "Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
16 7 Cartman "Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nothing.
"
16 7 Cartman "Nobody.
"
16 7 Cartman "Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
16 7 Cartman "That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
16 7 Cartman "Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
16 7 Cartman "You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I'm gonna get you! 
"
16 7 Cartman "I almost got you! Almost! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
16 7 Cartman "It's not fair! They were so... happy!
"
16 7 Cartman "It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't!
"
16 7 Cartman "No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
"
16 7 Cartman "And you! I should never have believed in you!
"
16 7 Cartman "I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
16 7 Cartman "Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
16 7 Cartman "Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
16 7 Cartman "Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
16 7 Cartman "Denver Nuggets game?
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO! 
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooooooo!
"
16 7 Cartman "NOOOOOOO. 
"
16 7 Cartman "No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
16 7 Cartman "Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
16 7 Cartman "I swear, Kyle. 
"
16 7 Cartman "Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
"
16 7 Cartman "Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
16 7 Cartman "That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
16 7 Cartman "Really?!
"
16 7 Cartman "What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
16 7 Cartman "Hey, stop it!
"
16 7 Cartman "Nooo!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's right, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
"
16 8 Cartman "That's true.
"
16 8 Cartman "Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
16 8 Cartman "Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
16 8 Cartman "Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
16 8 Cartman "I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
16 8 Cartman "No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
16 8 Cartman "...I don't have a dad.
"
16 8 Cartman "Youuu save it all?
"
16 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
16 8 Cartman "Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
16 8 Cartman "Holy shit I think I do.
"
16 8 Cartman "That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
16 8 Cartman "That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
16 9 Cartman "See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
16 9 Cartman "I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
16 9 Cartman "No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
16 9 Cartman "Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
16 9 Cartman "That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
16 9 Cartman "Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
16 9 Cartman "Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
"
16 9 Cartman "And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
16 9 Cartman "What, Kyle?! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
16 9 Cartman "It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
16 9 Cartman "Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
16 9 Cartman "What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
16 9 Cartman "I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
16 9 Cartman "You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
"
16 9 Cartman "I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
16 9 Cartman "I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
16 9 Cartman "Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, no way!
"
16 10 Cartman "Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
16 10 Cartman "Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh no, really?
"
16 10 Cartman "Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
16 10 Cartman "What-what do you mean?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
16 10 Cartman "Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Sorry about this.
"
16 10 Cartman "'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
16 10 Cartman "That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
16 10 Cartman "I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
16 10 Cartman "You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
16 10 Cartman "He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
16 10 Cartman "Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Who is there?
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
16 10 Cartman "Heh- hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
16 10 Cartman "HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
16 10 Cartman "Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
16 10 Cartman "Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
"
16 10 Cartman "What?  Hello?
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.
"
16 10 Cartman "My password is uloveboobs!
"
16 10 Cartman "You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
16 10 Cartman "Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
16 10 Cartman "Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
16 10 Cartman "God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
16 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
16 11 Cartman "FELLAS! Fellas!
"
16 11 Cartman "You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
16 11 Cartman "It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
16 11 Cartman "Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
16 11 Cartman "Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
16 11 Cartman "...Wow.
"
16 11 Cartman "Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
16 11 Cartman "Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
16 11 Cartman "He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
16 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
16 12 Cartman "We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
16 12 Cartman "Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
16 12 Cartman "Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
"
16 12 Cartman "You'll just have to wait and see.
"
16 12 Cartman "Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
"
16 12 Cartman "This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
16 12 Cartman "I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
"
16 12 Cartman "The Incredible...
"
16 12 Cartman "No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
"
16 12 Cartman "The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
"
16 12 Cartman "JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
"
16 12 Cartman "That's right!
"
16 12 Cartman "Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
16 12 Cartman "You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
16 12 Cartman "Cartman SMASH! 
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
"
16 12 Cartman "Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
16 12 Cartman "Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
16 13 Cartman "I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
16 13 Cartman "All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
16 13 Cartman "Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
16 13 Cartman "Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
16 13 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
16 13 Cartman "The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
16 13 Cartman "Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
16 13 Cartman "Craig?! You asshole!
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
16 13 Cartman "Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
16 13 Cartman "...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
16 13 Cartman "Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
"
16 13 Cartman "...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
16 14 Cartman "MOM!
"
16 14 Cartman "She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom? Where's my mom?
"
16 14 Cartman """Warm nuts"", she said.
"
16 14 Cartman "Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
16 14 Cartman "No way dude. No way.
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
16 14 Cartman "Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
"
16 14 Cartman "MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
16 14 Cartman "Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
16 14 Cartman "Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
"
16 14 Cartman "You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
16 14 Cartman "What if I did, Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "Pretty sweet, huh?
"
16 14 Cartman "What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
16 14 Cartman "No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
"
16 14 Cartman "Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
"
16 14 Cartman "Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
16 14 Cartman "Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
16 14 Cartman "Hmmm, no.
"
16 14 Cartman "I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
16 14 Cartman "Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
16 14 Cartman "I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
16 14 Cartman "I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
16 14 Cartman "But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
16 14 Cartman "They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
16 14 Cartman "Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
16 14 Cartman "So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
16 14 Cartman "Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
16 14 Cartman "Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
16 14 Cartman "I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
"
16 14 Cartman "Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
16 14 Cartman "Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
16 14 Cartman "Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
16 14 Cartman "I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
16 14 Cartman "I want a part in the new movies!
"
16 14 Cartman "I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
16 14 Cartman "Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha.
"
16 14 Cartman "Haha. 
"
16 14 Cartman "I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
16 14 Cartman "Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
16 14 Cartman "No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
