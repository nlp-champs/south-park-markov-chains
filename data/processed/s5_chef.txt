5 1 Chef "Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
"
5 1 Chef "Uh, from your ass, children.
"
5 1 Chef "Oh.
"
5 1 Chef "The Black Death? Are you sure?
"
5 1 Chef "LaToya Jackson, children.
"
5 1 Chef "But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
"
5 1 Chef "It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite"".
"
5 1 Chef "The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
"
5 1 Chef "Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
"
5 1 Chef "Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before.
"
5 1 Chef "Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!
"
5 1 Chef "Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!
"
5 1 Chef "My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit"".
"
5 1 Chef "Hey! Hold on a minute!
"
5 1 Chef "Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
"
5 1 Chef "Damn cracker-ass producers!
"
5 1 Chef "I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
"
5 1 Chef "Who are you?
"
5 1 Chef "We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
"
5 1 Chef "'Scuse me. Do you work here?
"
5 1 Chef "We just need help identifying this. 
"
5 1 Chef "Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.
"
5 1 Chef "But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
"
5 1 Chef "Knights of Standards and Practices?
"
5 1 Chef "Oh no!
"
5 1 Chef "Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
"
5 1 Chef "I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
"
5 4 Chef "Hello, Eric!
"
5 4 Chef "I made some chili to enter into the contest.
"
5 4 Chef "This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
"
5 4 Chef "It's my special recipe.
"
5 7 Chef "Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
"
5 7 Chef "The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
"
5 7 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
5 7 Chef "How is sexual education class going?
"
5 7 Chef "Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
"
5 7 Chef "...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
"
5 7 Chef "Kindergarten?!
"
5 7 Chef "Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!
"
5 7 Chef "Oh, no!
"
5 7 Chef "Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
"
5 7 Chef "Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 
"
5 7 Chef "It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
"
5 7 Chef "Seventeen.
"
5 7 Chef "Nope, just 17.
"
5 7 Chef "Seventeen! You're ready. 
"
5 12 Chef "Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- 
"
5 12 Chef "For what?
"
5 12 Chef "But... I'm not rich.
"
5 12 Chef "I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
"
5 12 Chef "Woo, fudge the snow now. 
"
5 12 Chef "I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
"
5 13 Chef "Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
"
5 13 Chef "Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
"
5 13 Chef "Hello there, children.
"
5 13 Chef "How's it goin'?
"
5 13 Chef "Yeah. Things have been better.
"
5 13 Chef "Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
"
5 13 Chef "Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 
"
5 1 Chef "Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
"
5 1 Chef "Uh, from your ass, children.
