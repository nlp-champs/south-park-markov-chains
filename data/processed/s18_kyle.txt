18 9 Kyle "Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
18 9 Kyle "Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yes! 
"
18 9 Kyle "Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
18 9 Kyle "Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
18 9 Kyle "Well what are you watching?
"
18 9 Kyle "You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
18 9 Kyle "Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
18 9 Kyle "Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
18 9 Kyle "Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
18 9 Kyle "Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
18 9 Kyle "Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
18 9 Kyle "Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "What the fuck?!
"
18 9 Kyle "Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
18 9 Kyle "But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
"
18 9 Kyle "What do you think you're doing?!
"
18 9 Kyle "You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
18 9 Kyle "I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
18 9 Kyle "This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
18 9 Kyle "Let's Plays?
"
18 9 Kyle "You're not gonna believe this.
"
18 9 Kyle "I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
"
18 9 Kyle "Come on! 
"
18 9 Kyle "See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
18 9 Kyle "And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"
18 9 Kyle "This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
"
18 9 Kyle "It's dying. The living room is... dying.
"
18 9 Kyle "I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"
18 9 Kyle "You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
"
18 9 Kyle "Do you mind?!
"
18 9 Kyle "Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"
18 9 Kyle "What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
"
18 9 Kyle "It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
"
18 9 Kyle "There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
"
18 9 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
"
18 9 Kyle "THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
18 1 Kyle "Barking vaginal belch.
"
18 1 Kyle "Bloody butt cough.
"
18 1 Kyle "How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
"
18 1 Kyle "It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
"
18 1 Kyle "What?! Tell us!
"
18 1 Kyle "Washington Redskins?
"
18 1 Kyle "What?!
"
18 1 Kyle "Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
"
18 1 Kyle "I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
"
18 1 Kyle "No way!
"
18 1 Kyle "Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
"
18 1 Kyle "People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
18 1 Kyle "That's the Catholic Church!
"
18 1 Kyle "That's the NFL!
"
18 1 Kyle "All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
"
18 1 Kyle "Maybe I'll start my own company.
"
18 1 Kyle "I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"
18 1 Kyle "It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
"
18 1 Kyle "You okay, bro?
"
18 1 Kyle "Give it time, it'll grow on you.
"
18 1 Kyle "Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
"
18 1 Kyle "Well whattaya mean?
"
18 1 Kyle "Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. 
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
"
18 1 Kyle "What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. 
"
18 1 Kyle "What?!
"
18 1 Kyle "No, I just can't get it to load.
"
18 1 Kyle "My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
"
18 1 Kyle "He's right. We should do a merger.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
18 1 Kyle "Whattaya say, Cartman?
"
18 1 Kyle "When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
18 1 Kyle "What the heck is that? 
"
18 1 Kyle "Change our name?
"
18 1 Kyle "When was that?
"
18 1 Kyle "Well what the hell do we do?
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey guys!
"
18 2 Kyle "Sup, Jason? 
"
18 2 Kyle "Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
"
18 2 Kyle "We were- trying to be funny.
"
18 2 Kyle "Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?
"
18 2 Kyle "Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
"
18 2 Kyle "I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"
18 2 Kyle "Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
"
18 2 Kyle "No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
18 2 Kyle "A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
"
18 2 Kyle "Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
"
18 2 Kyle "Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey Cartman.
"
18 2 Kyle "Dude, calm down.
"
18 2 Kyle "Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
"
18 2 Kyle "That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
"
18 2 Kyle "We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
"
18 2 Kyle "Jesus Christ, dude.
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman?
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
"
18 2 Kyle "We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
"
18 3 Kyle "Are you okay, Cartman?
"
18 3 Kyle "Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
"
18 5 Kyle "Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
"
18 5 Kyle "That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
"
18 5 Kyle "Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
"
18 5 Kyle "That's terrible!
"
18 5 Kyle "Are you happy now?!
"
18 5 Kyle "Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
"
18 5 Kyle "See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
"
18 5 Kyle "I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
"
18 5 Kyle "I was in the bathroom-
"
18 5 Kyle "No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
"
18 5 Kyle "How is that spying?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey Jimmy. What's up?
"
18 6 Kyle "Oh. Really?
"
18 6 Kyle "Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
"
18 6 Kyle "What?
"
18 6 Kyle "This is stupid!
"
18 6 Kyle "It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
"
18 6 Kyle "Who makes this crap?
"
18 6 Kyle "You... missed school today?
"
18 6 Kyle "Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
"
18 6 Kyle "You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
"
18 6 Kyle "Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
"
18 6 Kyle "Kenny, who told you about this game?
"
18 6 Kyle "Dude, what?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
"
18 6 Kyle "Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"
18 6 Kyle "Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You just push it on other people?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
"
18 6 Kyle "But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You have your crutches!
"
18 6 Kyle "You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Sure. Come on, guys. 
"
18 6 Kyle "We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
"
18 6 Kyle "Wuh, what's done?
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey dude.
"
18 6 Kyle "Y-you alright?
"
18 7 Kyle "Coup de grah, Cartman
"
18 7 Kyle "Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
"
18 7 Kyle "You should probably listen to him, dude.
"
18 7 Kyle "Maybe we are.
"
18 7 Kyle "Hello?
"
18 7 Kyle "Again?
"
18 7 Kyle "Uh huh.
"
18 7 Kyle "Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
"
18 7 Kyle "You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "Get up, Cartman!
"
18 7 Kyle "Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you if you're in on this.
"
18 7 Kyle "Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
18 7 Kyle "Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
"
18 7 Kyle "Kyle.
"
18 7 Kyle "I don't care!
"
18 7 Kyle "You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
18 7 Kyle "You haven't done anything yet!
"
18 7 Kyle "We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
"
18 7 Kyle "Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
"
18 7 Kyle "Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
"
18 7 Kyle "Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
18 7 Kyle "Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
"
18 7 Kyle "I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
"
18 7 Kyle "Www-what do you mean?
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "Don't... do that!
"
18 7 Kyle "NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
18 7 Kyle "No. Then I came into this virtual space.
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18 7 Kyle "Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"
18 7 Kyle "Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?
"
18 7 Kyle "Dude... What?
"
18 7 Kyle "Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
"
18 7 Kyle "Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
"
18 7 Kyle "Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
18 7 Kyle "God damn it Cartman!
"
18 7 Kyle "He's lying.
"
18 7 Kyle "Why not?
"
18 7 Kyle "Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
"
18 7 Kyle "We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
"
18 7 Kyle "We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"
18 7 Kyle "Alright, dude, take off the headset. 
"
18 7 Kyle "Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
"
18 8 Kyle "But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
"
18 8 Kyle "Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
18 8 Kyle "He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
"
18 8 Kyle "You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"
18 8 Kyle "Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
"
18 8 Kyle "It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
18 8 Kyle "It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
"
18 8 Kyle "Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
"
18 8 Kyle "You were?
"
18 8 Kyle "Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
"
18 8 Kyle "We don't... really know the difference.
"
18 8 Kyle "Then he's perfect for us.
"
18 8 Kyle "Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"
18 8 Kyle "You can do it, McNuggets! 
"
18 8 Kyle "All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
"
18 8 Kyle "You mean there's more to this?
"
18 8 Kyle "It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, you gotta know people.
"
18 8 Kyle "This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
"
18 8 Kyle "McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"
18 8 Kyle "Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
"
18 8 Kyle "Come on, Kenny! 
"
18 8 Kyle "He just had to shuffle it.
"
18 8 Kyle "Holy shit, dude!
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"
18 8 Kyle "Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
"
18 8 Kyle "Got what?
"
18 10 Kyle "It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
"
18 10 Kyle "Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
18 10 Kyle "I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"
18 10 Kyle "But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
"
18 10 Kyle "Whattaya think?
"
18 10 Kyle "Really??
"
18 10 Kyle "Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""
"
18 10 Kyle "But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
"
18 10 Kyle "Bill Cosby.
"
18 10 Kyle "Is here. To see me.
"
18 10 Kyle "Hello.
"
18 10 Kyle "We?
"
18 10 Kyle "Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"
18 10 Kyle "M-Ah, I'd love to.
"
18 10 Kyle "Uh okay! No problem! 
"
18 10 Kyle "Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
"
18 10 Kyle "Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18 10 Kyle "They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
"
18 10 Kyle "These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
18 10 Kyle "No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
"
18 10 Kyle "Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
"
18 10 Kyle "That son of a bitch!
"
18 10 Kyle "Why would he do this?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Mom?! Where is Ike?!
"
18 10 Kyle "That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
"
18 10 Kyle "WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
"
18 10 Kyle "Cartman, open this door right now!
"
18 10 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
"
18 10 Kyle "Because you just said, ""here in my room""!
"
18 10 Kyle "What are you talking about, Stan?
"
18 10 Kyle "Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
"
18 10 Kyle "I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"
18 10 Kyle "Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
"
18 10 Kyle "How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
"
18 10 Kyle "I am so confused.
"
18 10 Kyle "Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
"
18 10 Kyle "Help? How can you help?
"
18 10 Kyle "Really? That's what you guys would do?
"
18 10 Kyle "Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
"
18 10 Kyle "You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
"
18 10 Kyle "PewDiePie?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
"
18 10 Kyle "Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
"
18 10 Kyle "No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
"
18 9 Kyle "Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
18 9 Kyle "Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yes! 
"
18 9 Kyle "Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
18 9 Kyle "Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
18 9 Kyle "Well what are you watching?
"
18 9 Kyle "You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
18 9 Kyle "Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
18 9 Kyle "Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
18 9 Kyle "Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
18 9 Kyle "Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
"
18 9 Kyle "Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
18 9 Kyle "Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
18 9 Kyle "Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
18 9 Kyle "All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18 9 Kyle "What the fuck?!
"
18 9 Kyle "Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
18 9 Kyle "But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
"
18 9 Kyle "What do you think you're doing?!
"
18 9 Kyle "You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
18 9 Kyle "I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
18 9 Kyle "This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
18 9 Kyle "Let's Plays?
"
18 9 Kyle "You're not gonna believe this.
"
18 9 Kyle "I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
"
18 9 Kyle "Come on! 
"
18 9 Kyle "See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
18 9 Kyle "And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"
18 9 Kyle "This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
"
18 9 Kyle "It's dying. The living room is... dying.
"
18 9 Kyle "I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"
18 9 Kyle "You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
"
18 9 Kyle "Do you mind?!
"
18 9 Kyle "Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"
18 9 Kyle "What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
"
18 9 Kyle "It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
"
18 9 Kyle "There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
"
18 9 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
"
18 9 Kyle "THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
18 1 Kyle "Barking vaginal belch.
"
18 1 Kyle "Bloody butt cough.
"
18 1 Kyle "How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
"
18 1 Kyle "It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
"
18 1 Kyle "What?! Tell us!
"
18 1 Kyle "Washington Redskins?
"
18 1 Kyle "What?!
"
18 1 Kyle "Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
"
18 1 Kyle "I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
"
18 1 Kyle "No way!
"
18 1 Kyle "Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
"
18 1 Kyle "People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
18 1 Kyle "That's the Catholic Church!
"
18 1 Kyle "That's the NFL!
"
18 1 Kyle "All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
"
18 1 Kyle "Maybe I'll start my own company.
"
18 1 Kyle "I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"
18 1 Kyle "It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
"
18 1 Kyle "You okay, bro?
"
18 1 Kyle "Give it time, it'll grow on you.
"
18 1 Kyle "Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
"
18 1 Kyle "Well whattaya mean?
"
18 1 Kyle "Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. 
"
18 1 Kyle "Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
"
18 1 Kyle "What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. 
"
18 1 Kyle "What?!
"
18 1 Kyle "No, I just can't get it to load.
"
18 1 Kyle "My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
"
18 1 Kyle "He's right. We should do a merger.
"
18 1 Kyle "Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
18 1 Kyle "Whattaya say, Cartman?
"
18 1 Kyle "When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
18 1 Kyle "What the heck is that? 
"
18 1 Kyle "Change our name?
"
18 1 Kyle "When was that?
"
18 1 Kyle "Well what the hell do we do?
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey guys!
"
18 2 Kyle "Sup, Jason? 
"
18 2 Kyle "Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
"
18 2 Kyle "We were- trying to be funny.
"
18 2 Kyle "Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?
"
18 2 Kyle "Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
"
18 2 Kyle "I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"
18 2 Kyle "Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
"
18 2 Kyle "No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
18 2 Kyle "A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
"
18 2 Kyle "Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
"
18 2 Kyle "Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey Cartman.
"
18 2 Kyle "Dude, calm down.
"
18 2 Kyle "Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
"
18 2 Kyle "That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
"
18 2 Kyle "We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
"
18 2 Kyle "Jesus Christ, dude.
"
18 2 Kyle "Cartman?
"
18 2 Kyle "Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
"
18 2 Kyle "We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
"
18 3 Kyle "Are you okay, Cartman?
"
18 3 Kyle "Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
"
18 5 Kyle "Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
"
18 5 Kyle "That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
"
18 5 Kyle "Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
"
18 5 Kyle "That's terrible!
"
18 5 Kyle "Are you happy now?!
"
18 5 Kyle "Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
"
18 5 Kyle "See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
"
18 5 Kyle "I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
"
18 5 Kyle "I was in the bathroom-
"
18 5 Kyle "No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
"
18 5 Kyle "How is that spying?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey Jimmy. What's up?
"
18 6 Kyle "Oh. Really?
"
18 6 Kyle "Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
"
18 6 Kyle "What?
"
18 6 Kyle "This is stupid!
"
18 6 Kyle "It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
"
18 6 Kyle "Who makes this crap?
"
18 6 Kyle "You... missed school today?
"
18 6 Kyle "Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
"
18 6 Kyle "You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
"
18 6 Kyle "Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
"
18 6 Kyle "Kenny, who told you about this game?
"
18 6 Kyle "Dude, what?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
"
18 6 Kyle "Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"
18 6 Kyle "Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You just push it on other people?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
"
18 6 Kyle "But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
"
18 6 Kyle "You have your crutches!
"
18 6 Kyle "You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"
18 6 Kyle "Sure. Come on, guys. 
"
18 6 Kyle "We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
"
18 6 Kyle "Wuh, what's done?
"
18 6 Kyle "Hey dude.
"
18 6 Kyle "Y-you alright?
"
18 7 Kyle "Coup de grah, Cartman
"
18 7 Kyle "Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
"
18 7 Kyle "You should probably listen to him, dude.
"
18 7 Kyle "Maybe we are.
"
18 7 Kyle "Hello?
"
18 7 Kyle "Again?
"
18 7 Kyle "Uh huh.
"
18 7 Kyle "Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
"
18 7 Kyle "You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "Get up, Cartman!
"
18 7 Kyle "Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you if you're in on this.
"
18 7 Kyle "Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
18 7 Kyle "Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
"
18 7 Kyle "Kyle.
"
18 7 Kyle "I don't care!
"
18 7 Kyle "You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
18 7 Kyle "You haven't done anything yet!
"
18 7 Kyle "We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
"
18 7 Kyle "Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
"
18 7 Kyle "Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
"
18 7 Kyle "Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
18 7 Kyle "Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
"
18 7 Kyle "I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
"
18 7 Kyle "Www-what do you mean?
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Kyle "Don't... do that!
"
18 7 Kyle "NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
18 7 Kyle "No. Then I came into this virtual space.
"
18 7 Kyle "Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18 7 Kyle "Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"
18 7 Kyle "Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?
"
18 7 Kyle "Dude... What?
"
18 7 Kyle "Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
"
18 7 Kyle "Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
"
18 7 Kyle "Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
18 7 Kyle "God damn it Cartman!
"
18 7 Kyle "He's lying.
"
18 7 Kyle "Why not?
"
18 7 Kyle "Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
"
18 7 Kyle "We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
"
18 7 Kyle "We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"
18 7 Kyle "Alright, dude, take off the headset. 
"
18 7 Kyle "Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
"
18 8 Kyle "But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
"
18 8 Kyle "Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
18 8 Kyle "He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
"
18 8 Kyle "You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"
18 8 Kyle "Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
"
18 8 Kyle "It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
18 8 Kyle "It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
"
18 8 Kyle "Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
"
18 8 Kyle "You were?
"
18 8 Kyle "Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
"
18 8 Kyle "We don't... really know the difference.
"
18 8 Kyle "Then he's perfect for us.
"
18 8 Kyle "Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"
18 8 Kyle "You can do it, McNuggets! 
"
18 8 Kyle "All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
"
18 8 Kyle "You mean there's more to this?
"
18 8 Kyle "It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, you gotta know people.
"
18 8 Kyle "This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
"
18 8 Kyle "McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"
18 8 Kyle "Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
"
18 8 Kyle "Come on, Kenny! 
"
18 8 Kyle "He just had to shuffle it.
"
18 8 Kyle "Holy shit, dude!
"
18 8 Kyle "Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"
18 8 Kyle "Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
"
18 8 Kyle "Got what?
"
18 10 Kyle "It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
"
18 10 Kyle "Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
18 10 Kyle "I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"
18 10 Kyle "But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
"
18 10 Kyle "Whattaya think?
"
18 10 Kyle "Really??
"
18 10 Kyle "Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""
"
18 10 Kyle "But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
"
18 10 Kyle "Bill Cosby.
"
18 10 Kyle "Is here. To see me.
"
18 10 Kyle "Hello.
"
18 10 Kyle "We?
"
18 10 Kyle "Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"
18 10 Kyle "M-Ah, I'd love to.
"
18 10 Kyle "Uh okay! No problem! 
"
18 10 Kyle "Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
"
18 10 Kyle "Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18 10 Kyle "They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
"
18 10 Kyle "These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
18 10 Kyle "No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
"
18 10 Kyle "Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
"
18 10 Kyle "That son of a bitch!
"
18 10 Kyle "Why would he do this?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Mom?! Where is Ike?!
"
18 10 Kyle "That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
"
18 10 Kyle "WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
"
18 10 Kyle "Cartman, open this door right now!
"
18 10 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
"
18 10 Kyle "Because you just said, ""here in my room""!
"
18 10 Kyle "What are you talking about, Stan?
"
18 10 Kyle "Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
"
18 10 Kyle "I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"
18 10 Kyle "Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
"
18 10 Kyle "How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
"
18 10 Kyle "I am so confused.
"
18 10 Kyle "Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
"
18 10 Kyle "Help? How can you help?
"
18 10 Kyle "Really? That's what you guys would do?
"
18 10 Kyle "Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
"
18 10 Kyle "You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
"
18 10 Kyle "PewDiePie?!
"
18 10 Kyle "Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
"
18 10 Kyle "Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
"
18 10 Kyle "No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
"
