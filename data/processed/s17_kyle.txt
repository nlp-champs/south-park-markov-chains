17 1 Kyle "I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
"
17 1 Kyle "AAAARGH!
"
17 1 Kyle "That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
"
17 1 Kyle "Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
"
17 1 Kyle "How do we have a choice?!
"
17 1 Kyle "Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
"
17 1 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
17 1 Kyle "You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
"
17 2 Kyle "Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
"
17 2 Kyle "Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
"
17 2 Kyle "What? How do you know?
"
17 2 Kyle "That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
"
17 2 Kyle "Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 
"
17 2 Kyle "Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
"
17 2 Kyle "You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
"
17 2 Kyle "Corey Lanskin?
"
17 2 Kyle "We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
"
17 2 Kyle "Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
"
17 2 Kyle "So you know it.
"
17 2 Kyle "We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
"
17 2 Kyle "Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
"
17 2 Kyle "Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
"
17 2 Kyle "You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
"
17 2 Kyle "Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
"
17 3 Kyle "He's doing it a-gain.
"
17 3 Kyle "Yeah, that sucked.
"
17 3 Kyle "You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
"
17 3 Kyle "That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
"
17 3 Kyle "You're a murderer.
"
17 5 Kyle "Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
"
17 5 Kyle "I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
"
17 5 Kyle "Hey Ike, how's it going?
"
17 5 Kyle "I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
"
17 5 Kyle "Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
"
17 5 Kyle "It always has been. See? This is nice. 
"
17 5 Kyle "What?
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
"
17 5 Kyle "No, I just don't think it's healthy.
"
17 5 Kyle "Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
17 5 Kyle "No.
"
17 5 Kyle "It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
"
17 5 Kyle "Right now.
"
17 5 Kyle "I don't know.
"
17 5 Kyle "What?
"
17 5 Kyle "He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
"
17 5 Kyle "Yeah, he just seems so young.
"
17 5 Kyle "Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
"
17 5 Kyle "What the fuck is going on?!
"
17 5 Kyle "I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
"
17 5 Kyle "He doesn't even let me near him!
"
17 5 Kyle "What??
"
17 5 Kyle "Oh, thanks! 
"
17 5 Kyle "I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
17 5 Kyle "Hey Ike.
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
17 5 Kyle "I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, I do! I just-
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike no! Stop!
"
17 5 Kyle "We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
"
17 5 Kyle "That's what I thought.
"
17 5 Kyle "Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
"
17 5 Kyle "I'm your big brother, Ike! 
"
17 5 Kyle "I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
"
17 5 Kyle "Hey!
"
17 5 Kyle "Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
"
17 5 Kyle "What?
"
17 5 Kyle "No, this is his brother.
"
17 5 Kyle "Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
"
17 5 Kyle "Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
"
17 5 Kyle "Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
"
17 5 Kyle "You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
"
17 5 Kyle "I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""
"
17 5 Kyle "Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
"
17 5 Kyle "That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
"
17 5 Kyle "Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike!  Wait! '
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
"
17 5 Kyle "Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
"
17 5 Kyle "Ike?
"
17 5 Kyle "It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
"
17 5 Kyle "Yeah, I bet she does.
"
17 6 Kyle "About what?!
"
17 6 Kyle "Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
"
17 6 Kyle "Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
"
17 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
17 6 Kyle "Nothing. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Wuwhat's going on?
"
17 6 Kyle "I don't speak Hebrew.
"
17 6 Kyle "He said they come on urgent business.
"
17 6 Kyle "The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
"
17 6 Kyle "It's right over here by uh-
"
17 6 Kyle "He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
"
17 6 Kyle "Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
"
17 6 Kyle "Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
"
17 6 Kyle "NOOOO!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
17 6 Kyle "No shit!
"
17 6 Kyle "Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
"
17 6 Kyle "Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
"
17 6 Kyle "Dude, go to Hell!
"
17 6 Kyle "Wwwait. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Mom?
"
17 6 Kyle "Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
"
17 6 Kyle "You're a fat skank, Mom. 
"
17 6 Kyle "You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
"
17 6 Kyle "I just... thought it'd be nice.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes sir.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
17 6 Kyle "If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
"
17 6 Kyle "Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
"
17 6 Kyle "Because they taste so yummy. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
"
17 6 Kyle "Please...
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Hey
"
17 6 Kyle "I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
"
17 6 Kyle "I just do, Stan.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "NO.
"
17 6 Kyle "This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
"
17 6 Kyle "I don't care.
"
17 6 Kyle "That's fine. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
"
17 6 Kyle "No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Huh? Who...? Who is that?
"
17 6 Kyle "I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
"
17 6 Kyle "I... I know.
"
17 6 Kyle "That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes! Yes I will!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes, whatever you want. 
"
17 6 Kyle "It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Hello, Stan.
"
17 6 Kyle "There are greater things at work than what you understand.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
"
17 6 Kyle "I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"
17 6 Kyle "All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
"
17 6 Kyle "Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Dude! Do not do this!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"
17 6 Kyle "I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
"
17 6 Kyle "Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm sorry, Kenny!
"
17 6 Kyle "Hurray!
"
17 6 Kyle "Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes! It did!
"
17 6 Kyle "But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
"
17 6 Kyle "But it's the truth!
"
17 6 Kyle "Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
"
17 7 Kyle "Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
17 7 Kyle "Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
17 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
17 7 Kyle "Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"
17 7 Kyle "If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
17 7 Kyle "No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
"
17 7 Kyle "No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
"
17 7 Kyle "Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
"
17 7 Kyle "Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
"
17 7 Kyle "I know.
"
17 7 Kyle "I don't know.
"
17 7 Kyle "This isn't helping us, Butters!
"
17 7 Kyle "Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
"
17 8 Kyle "Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
"
17 8 Kyle "It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
"
17 8 Kyle "Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"
17 8 Kyle "If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
17 8 Kyle "Grounded? For what?
"
17 8 Kyle "No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
"
17 8 Kyle "What?
"
17 8 Kyle "Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
"
17 8 Kyle "All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
"
17 9 Kyle "This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"
17 9 Kyle "Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
"
17 9 Kyle "I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
"
17 9 Kyle "Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
"
17 9 Kyle "Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
17 9 Kyle "Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
"
17 9 Kyle "Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
"
17 9 Kyle "I swear, Stan.
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
"
17 9 Kyle "Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
"
17 9 Kyle "What the hell did you do??
"
17 9 Kyle "No. Tell me you didn't!
"
17 9 Kyle "Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
"
17 9 Kyle "Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan, it's me.
"
17 9 Kyle "Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
"
17 9 Kyle "You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
"
17 9 Kyle "You didn't?
"
17 9 Kyle "I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan, don't say that.
"
17 9 Kyle "Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
"
17 9 Kyle "I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
"
17 9 Kyle "I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
"
17 9 Kyle "The fight is over, Cartman!
"
17 9 Kyle "Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
"
17 9 Kyle "No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan?
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
"
17 10 Kyle "Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"
17 1 Kyle "I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!

17 6 Kyle "Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
"
17 6 Kyle "You're a fat skank, Mom. 
"
17 6 Kyle "You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
"
17 6 Kyle "I just... thought it'd be nice.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes sir.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.

17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
17 6 Kyle "If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
"
17 6 Kyle "Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
"
17 6 Kyle "Because they taste so yummy. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
"
17 6 Kyle "Please...
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Hey
"
17 6 Kyle "I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
"
17 6 Kyle "I just do, Stan.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "NO.
"
17 6 Kyle "This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
"
17 6 Kyle "I don't care.
"
17 6 Kyle "That's fine. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
"
17 6 Kyle "No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Huh? Who...? Who is that?
"
17 6 Kyle "I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
"
17 6 Kyle "I... I know.
"
17 6 Kyle "That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes.
"
17 6 Kyle "I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes! Yes I will!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes, whatever you want. 
"
17 6 Kyle "It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
"
17 6 Kyle "Hello, Stan.
"
17 6 Kyle "There are greater things at work than what you understand.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
"
17 6 Kyle "I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"
17 6 Kyle "All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
"
17 6 Kyle "Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
17 6 Kyle "Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
"
17 6 Kyle "Dude! Do not do this!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"
17 6 Kyle "I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
"
17 6 Kyle "Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
"
17 6 Kyle "I'm sorry, Kenny!
"
17 6 Kyle "Hurray!
"
17 6 Kyle "Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
"
17 6 Kyle "Yes! It did!
"
17 6 Kyle "But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
"
17 6 Kyle "But it's the truth!
"
17 6 Kyle "Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
"
17 7 Kyle "Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
17 7 Kyle "Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
17 7 Kyle "Yeah.
"
17 7 Kyle "Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"
17 7 Kyle "If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
17 7 Kyle "No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
"
17 7 Kyle "No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
"
17 7 Kyle "Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
"
17 7 Kyle "Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
"
17 7 Kyle "I know.
"
17 7 Kyle "I don't know.
"
17 7 Kyle "This isn't helping us, Butters!
"
17 7 Kyle "Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
"
17 8 Kyle "Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
"
17 8 Kyle "It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
"
17 8 Kyle "Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"
17 8 Kyle "If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
17 8 Kyle "Grounded? For what?
"
17 8 Kyle "No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
"
17 8 Kyle "What?
"
17 8 Kyle "Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
"
17 8 Kyle "All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
"
17 9 Kyle "This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"
17 9 Kyle "Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
"
17 9 Kyle "I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
"
17 9 Kyle "Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
"
17 9 Kyle "Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
17 9 Kyle "Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
"
17 9 Kyle "Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
"
17 9 Kyle "I swear, Stan.
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
"
17 9 Kyle "Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
"
17 9 Kyle "What the hell did you do??
"
17 9 Kyle "No. Tell me you didn't!
"
17 9 Kyle "Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
"
17 9 Kyle "Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan, it's me.
"
17 9 Kyle "Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
"
17 9 Kyle "You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
"
17 9 Kyle "You didn't?
"
17 9 Kyle "I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan, don't say that.
"
17 9 Kyle "Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
"
17 9 Kyle "I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
"
17 9 Kyle "I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
"
17 9 Kyle "The fight is over, Cartman!
"
17 9 Kyle "Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
"
17 9 Kyle "No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17 9 Kyle "Stan?
"
17 9 Kyle "Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
"
17 10 Kyle "Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"
