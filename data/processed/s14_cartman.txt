14 1 Cartman "Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
14 1 Cartman "Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh dude, was that a combo move?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
14 1 Cartman "Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
14 1 Cartman "I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
14 1 Cartman "What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh really? Sweet.
"
14 2 Cartman "Oho man, I can't wait!
"
14 2 Cartman "No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
14 2 Cartman "Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
14 2 Cartman "They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
14 2 Cartman "We know, we were just saying that.
"
14 2 Cartman "It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
14 2 Cartman "The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
14 2 Cartman "It was a... a warm spring morning. 
"
14 2 Cartman "Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
14 2 Cartman "...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
14 2 Cartman "And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what are you up to?
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
14 2 Cartman "That's right.
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
14 2 Cartman "That inconsiderate jerk!
"
14 2 Cartman "There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
"
14 2 Cartman "There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
14 2 Cartman "All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
"
14 2 Cartman "Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
14 2 Cartman "Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
14 2 Cartman "Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
"
14 2 Cartman "See any hunters yet?
"
14 2 Cartman "Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
14 2 Cartman "So what?
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh dude, sweet! 
"
14 2 Cartman "People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
14 2 Cartman "What?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh come on!
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
14 2 Cartman "You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
14 2 Cartman "Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
14 3 Cartman "I know, it sucks. 
"
14 3 Cartman "KFC!! 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
14 3 Cartman "They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
14 3 Cartman "This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
14 3 Cartman "Mom, drive faster!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
"
14 3 Cartman "WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
14 3 Cartman "Fuck you!
"
14 3 Cartman "No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 
"
14 3 Cartman "No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
14 3 Cartman "You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nooooooooo-! 
"
14 3 Cartman "I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Really?
"
14 3 Cartman "Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
14 3 Cartman "NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah. Who isn't?
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
14 3 Cartman "Tommy said you have some KFC.
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
14 3 Cartman "85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
14 3 Cartman "How much KFC are we talking?
"
14 3 Cartman "Holy fuck, dude.
"
14 3 Cartman "Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
14 3 Cartman "Are you Teabag?
"
14 3 Cartman "Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
14 3 Cartman "Extra crispy? 
"
14 3 Cartman "You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
14 3 Cartman "You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
14 3 Cartman "Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nothin', it's cool.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
14 3 Cartman "Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
14 3 Cartman "I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
14 3 Cartman "Good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
14 3 Cartman "...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
"
14 3 Cartman "I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
14 3 Cartman "Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
14 3 Cartman "Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
14 3 Cartman "What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
14 3 Cartman "Colonel, how are you doing?
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
14 3 Cartman "We had a little problem.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
14 4 Cartman "I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
14 4 Cartman "'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
14 4 Cartman "Surprise! 
"
14 4 Cartman "Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
14 4 Cartman "Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
"
14 4 Cartman "Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
14 4 Cartman "You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
14 4 Cartman "Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
14 4 Cartman "It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
14 4 Cartman "Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
14 4 Cartman "Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
14 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
14 4 Cartman "Okay let's, let's try this one.
"
14 4 Cartman "Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
14 4 Cartman "This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
14 4 Cartman "Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
14 4 Cartman "Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
14 4 Cartman "Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
14 4 Cartman "Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
14 4 Cartman "Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
14 5 Cartman "Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
"
14 5 Cartman "AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
14 5 Cartman "I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
14 5 Cartman "Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
14 5 Cartman "I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
14 5 Cartman "Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
14 5 Cartman "Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
14 5 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
14 5 Cartman "Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
14 5 Cartman "If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
14 5 Cartman "You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
14 5 Cartman "Yeah, so what?
"
14 5 Cartman "So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
14 5 Cartman "No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
"
14 5 Cartman "You just had seven tacos.
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
14 5 Cartman "You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
14 5 Cartman "I tried getting one last week!
"
14 5 Cartman "God, will somebody shut her up?
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
14 5 Cartman "Let me by...
"
14 5 Cartman "Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
14 5 Cartman "My father...
"
14 5 Cartman "I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
14 5 Cartman "How could you know anything about who my family is?
"
14 5 Cartman "If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
14 5 Cartman "Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
14 5 Cartman "I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
14 5 Cartman "I said GET. Mr. Hat!
"
14 5 Cartman "Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
14 5 Cartman "Keep... your hand... UP!
"
14 5 Cartman "By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
14 6 Cartman "That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
14 6 Cartman "Ahaaa!
"
14 6 Cartman "Nice work, Conner.
"
14 6 Cartman "Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
14 6 Cartman "Them who?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Then start explaining it to me!
"
14 6 Cartman "No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "It's all that matters!
"
14 6 Cartman "I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
14 6 Cartman "Gingers? No!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
14 6 Cartman "Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
14 6 Cartman "Daddy?
"
14 6 Cartman "Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
14 6 Cartman "Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
14 6 Cartman "What do you know?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Mom?
"
14 6 Cartman "Protect who??
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a Denver Bronco?
"
14 6 Cartman "No- nooo.
"
14 6 Cartman "No! Noooo!
"
14 6 Cartman "Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
14 6 Cartman "What?
"
14 6 Cartman "Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
14 6 Cartman "Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
14 6 Cartman "Take it easy, Conner. 
"
14 7 Cartman "Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
14 7 Cartman "You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
14 7 Cartman "If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
"
14 8 Cartman "It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
14 8 Cartman "I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
14 8 Cartman "No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
14 8 Cartman "No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "You love NASCAR huh?
"
14 8 Cartman "You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
14 8 Cartman "You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
14 8 Cartman "But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
14 8 Cartman "Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
14 8 Cartman "I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
14 8 Cartman "I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
14 8 Cartman "Not yet.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Fucking gross!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
14 8 Cartman """Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""
"
14 8 Cartman "Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
14 8 Cartman "Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
14 8 Cartman "Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "What's that?
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
14 8 Cartman "All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
14 8 Cartman "I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw donkey balls...
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
14 8 Cartman "Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
14 8 Cartman "Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh hey, Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
"
14 8 Cartman "I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah?
"
14 8 Cartman "...Uh oh.
"
14 8 Cartman "Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
14 8 Cartman "Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
14 8 Cartman "Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
14 8 Cartman "Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "He's fuckin' gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
14 8 Cartman "Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
14 8 Cartman "You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Get off my car, Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
14 8 Cartman "No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
14 8 Cartman "The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
14 9 Cartman "You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
14 9 Cartman "Oops, busted. 
"
14 9 Cartman "Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
14 9 Cartman "You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
"
14 9 Cartman "You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
14 9 Cartman "Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
14 9 Cartman "Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
"
14 9 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
14 9 Cartman "And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
14 9 Cartman "Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
14 9 Cartman "Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
14 9 Cartman "That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
14 9 Cartman "So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
14 9 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
14 9 Cartman "This is very serious, Butters.
"
14 9 Cartman "Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
14 9 Cartman "Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
14 9 Cartman "I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
14 9 Cartman "Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
14 9 Cartman "Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
14 9 Cartman "Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
"
14 9 Cartman "You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
14 9 Cartman "What does it want?!
"
14 9 Cartman "No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Thank you, Kyle.
"
14 9 Cartman "Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
14 10 Cartman "So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
14 10 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
"
14 11 Cartman "I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
14 11 Cartman "I need to speak with him, please.
"
14 11 Cartman "I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
14 11 Cartman "Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
14 11 Cartman "I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
14 11 Cartman "...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
14 11 Cartman "Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
14 11 Cartman "Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
14 11 Cartman "Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
14 11 Cartman "Asshoooles! 
"
14 14 Cartman "Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
"
14 14 Cartman "Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
14 14 Cartman "Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
14 14 Cartman "Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
14 14 Cartman "What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
14 14 Cartman "Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
14 1 Cartman "Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
14 1 Cartman "Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh dude, was that a combo move?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
14 1 Cartman "Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
14 1 Cartman "I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
14 1 Cartman "What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh really? Sweet.
"
14 2 Cartman "Oho man, I can't wait!
"
14 2 Cartman "No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
14 2 Cartman "Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
14 2 Cartman "They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
14 2 Cartman "We know, we were just saying that.
"
14 2 Cartman "It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
14 2 Cartman "The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
14 2 Cartman "It was a... a warm spring morning. 
"
14 2 Cartman "Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
14 2 Cartman "...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
14 2 Cartman "And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what are you up to?
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
14 2 Cartman "That's right.
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
14 2 Cartman "That inconsiderate jerk!
"
14 2 Cartman "There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
"
14 2 Cartman "There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
14 2 Cartman "All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
"
14 2 Cartman "Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
14 2 Cartman "Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
14 2 Cartman "Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
"
14 2 Cartman "See any hunters yet?
"
14 2 Cartman "Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
14 2 Cartman "So what?
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh dude, sweet! 
"
14 2 Cartman "People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
14 2 Cartman "What?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh come on!
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
14 2 Cartman "You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
14 2 Cartman "Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
14 3 Cartman "I know, it sucks. 
"
14 3 Cartman "KFC!! 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
14 3 Cartman "They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
14 3 Cartman "This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
14 3 Cartman "Mom, drive faster!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
"
14 3 Cartman "WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
14 3 Cartman "Fuck you!
"
14 3 Cartman "No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 
"
14 3 Cartman "No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
14 3 Cartman "You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nooooooooo-! 
"
14 3 Cartman "I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Really?
"
14 3 Cartman "Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
14 3 Cartman "NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah. Who isn't?
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
14 3 Cartman "Tommy said you have some KFC.
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
14 3 Cartman "85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
14 3 Cartman "How much KFC are we talking?
"
14 3 Cartman "Holy fuck, dude.
"
14 3 Cartman "Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
14 3 Cartman "Are you Teabag?
"
14 3 Cartman "Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
14 3 Cartman "Extra crispy? 
"
14 3 Cartman "You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
14 3 Cartman "You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
14 3 Cartman "Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nothin', it's cool.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
14 3 Cartman "Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
14 3 Cartman "I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
14 3 Cartman "Good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
14 3 Cartman "...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
"
14 3 Cartman "I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
14 3 Cartman "Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
14 3 Cartman "Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
14 3 Cartman "What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
14 3 Cartman "Colonel, how are you doing?
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
14 3 Cartman "We had a little problem.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
14 4 Cartman "I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
14 4 Cartman "'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
14 4 Cartman "Surprise! 
"
14 4 Cartman "Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
14 4 Cartman "Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
"
14 4 Cartman "Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
14 4 Cartman "You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
14 4 Cartman "Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
14 4 Cartman "It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
14 4 Cartman "Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
14 4 Cartman "Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
14 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
14 4 Cartman "Okay let's, let's try this one.
"
14 4 Cartman "Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
14 4 Cartman "This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
14 4 Cartman "Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
14 4 Cartman "Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
14 4 Cartman "Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
14 4 Cartman "Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
14 4 Cartman "Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
14 5 Cartman "Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
"
14 5 Cartman "AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
14 5 Cartman "I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
14 5 Cartman "Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
14 5 Cartman "I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
14 5 Cartman "Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
14 5 Cartman "Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
14 5 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
14 5 Cartman "Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
14 5 Cartman "If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
14 5 Cartman "You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
14 5 Cartman "Yeah, so what?
"
14 5 Cartman "So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
14 5 Cartman "No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
"
14 5 Cartman "You just had seven tacos.
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
14 5 Cartman "You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
14 5 Cartman "I tried getting one last week!
"
14 5 Cartman "God, will somebody shut her up?
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
14 5 Cartman "Let me by...
"
14 5 Cartman "Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
14 5 Cartman "My father...
"
14 5 Cartman "I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
14 5 Cartman "How could you know anything about who my family is?
"
14 5 Cartman "If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
14 5 Cartman "Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
14 5 Cartman "I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
14 5 Cartman "I said GET. Mr. Hat!
"
14 5 Cartman "Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
14 5 Cartman "Keep... your hand... UP!
"
14 5 Cartman "By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
14 6 Cartman "That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
14 6 Cartman "Ahaaa!
"
14 6 Cartman "Nice work, Conner.
"
14 6 Cartman "Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
14 6 Cartman "Them who?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Then start explaining it to me!
"
14 6 Cartman "No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "It's all that matters!
"
14 6 Cartman "I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
14 6 Cartman "Gingers? No!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
14 6 Cartman "Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
14 6 Cartman "Daddy?
"
14 6 Cartman "Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
14 6 Cartman "Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
14 6 Cartman "What do you know?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Mom?
"
14 6 Cartman "Protect who??
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a Denver Bronco?
"
14 6 Cartman "No- nooo.
"
14 6 Cartman "No! Noooo!
"
14 6 Cartman "Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
14 6 Cartman "What?
"
14 6 Cartman "Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
14 6 Cartman "Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
14 6 Cartman "Take it easy, Conner. 
"
14 7 Cartman "Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
14 7 Cartman "You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
14 7 Cartman "If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
"
14 8 Cartman "It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
14 8 Cartman "I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
14 8 Cartman "No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
14 8 Cartman "No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "You love NASCAR huh?
"
14 8 Cartman "You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
14 8 Cartman "You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
14 8 Cartman "But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
14 8 Cartman "Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
14 8 Cartman "I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
14 8 Cartman "I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
14 8 Cartman "Not yet.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Fucking gross!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
14 8 Cartman """Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""
"
14 8 Cartman "Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
14 8 Cartman "Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
14 8 Cartman "Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "What's that?
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
14 8 Cartman "All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
14 8 Cartman "I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw donkey balls...
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
14 8 Cartman "Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
14 8 Cartman "Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh hey, Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
"
14 8 Cartman "I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah?
"
14 8 Cartman "...Uh oh.
"
14 8 Cartman "Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
14 8 Cartman "Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
14 8 Cartman "Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
14 8 Cartman "Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "He's fuckin' gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
14 8 Cartman "Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
14 8 Cartman "You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Get off my car, Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
14 8 Cartman "No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
14 8 Cartman "The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
14 9 Cartman "You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
14 9 Cartman "Oops, busted. 
"
14 9 Cartman "Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
14 9 Cartman "You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
"
14 9 Cartman "You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
14 9 Cartman "Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
14 9 Cartman "Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
"
14 9 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
14 9 Cartman "And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
14 9 Cartman "Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
14 9 Cartman "Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
14 9 Cartman "That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
14 9 Cartman "So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
14 9 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
14 9 Cartman "This is very serious, Butters.
"
14 9 Cartman "Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
14 9 Cartman "Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
14 9 Cartman "I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
14 9 Cartman "Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
14 9 Cartman "Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
14 9 Cartman "Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
"
14 9 Cartman "You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
14 9 Cartman "What does it want?!
"
14 9 Cartman "No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Thank you, Kyle.
"
14 9 Cartman "Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
14 10 Cartman "So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
14 10 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
"
14 11 Cartman "I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
14 11 Cartman "I need to speak with him, please.
"
14 11 Cartman "I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
14 11 Cartman "Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
14 11 Cartman "I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
14 11 Cartman "...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
14 11 Cartman "Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
14 11 Cartman "Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
14 11 Cartman "Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
14 11 Cartman "Asshoooles! 
"
14 14 Cartman "Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
"
14 14 Cartman "Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
14 14 Cartman "Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
14 14 Cartman "Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
14 14 Cartman "What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
14 14 Cartman "Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
14 1 Cartman "Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
14 1 Cartman "Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh dude, was that a combo move?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
14 1 Cartman "Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
14 1 Cartman "I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
14 1 Cartman "Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
14 1 Cartman "What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
"
14 1 Cartman "Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh really? Sweet.
"
14 2 Cartman "Oho man, I can't wait!
"
14 2 Cartman "No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
14 2 Cartman "Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
14 2 Cartman "They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
14 2 Cartman "We know, we were just saying that.
"
14 2 Cartman "It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
14 2 Cartman "The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
14 2 Cartman "It was a... a warm spring morning. 
"
14 2 Cartman "Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
14 2 Cartman "...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
14 2 Cartman "And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what are you up to?
"
14 2 Cartman "Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
14 2 Cartman "That's right.
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
14 2 Cartman "That inconsiderate jerk!
"
14 2 Cartman "There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
"
14 2 Cartman "There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
14 2 Cartman "All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
"
14 2 Cartman "Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
14 2 Cartman "Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
14 2 Cartman "Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
"
14 2 Cartman "See any hunters yet?
"
14 2 Cartman "Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
14 2 Cartman "So what?
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh dude, sweet! 
"
14 2 Cartman "People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
14 2 Cartman "What?!
"
14 2 Cartman "Oh come on!
"
14 2 Cartman "Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
14 2 Cartman "That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
14 2 Cartman "You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
14 2 Cartman "Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
14 3 Cartman "I know, it sucks. 
"
14 3 Cartman "KFC!! 
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
14 3 Cartman "They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
14 3 Cartman "This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
14 3 Cartman "Mom, drive faster!
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
"
14 3 Cartman "WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
14 3 Cartman "Fuck you!
"
14 3 Cartman "No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 
"
14 3 Cartman "No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
14 3 Cartman "You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nooooooooo-! 
"
14 3 Cartman "I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Really?
"
14 3 Cartman "Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
"
14 3 Cartman "Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
14 3 Cartman "NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah. Who isn't?
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
14 3 Cartman "Tommy said you have some KFC.
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
14 3 Cartman "85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
14 3 Cartman "How much KFC are we talking?
"
14 3 Cartman "Holy fuck, dude.
"
14 3 Cartman "Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
14 3 Cartman "Are you Teabag?
"
14 3 Cartman "Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
14 3 Cartman "Extra crispy? 
"
14 3 Cartman "You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
14 3 Cartman "You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
14 3 Cartman "Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
14 3 Cartman "Nothin', it's cool.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
14 3 Cartman "Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
14 3 Cartman "Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
14 3 Cartman "I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
14 3 Cartman "Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
14 3 Cartman "Good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
14 3 Cartman "Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
14 3 Cartman "...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
"
14 3 Cartman "I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
14 3 Cartman "Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
14 3 Cartman "Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
14 3 Cartman "Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
14 3 Cartman "What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
14 3 Cartman "Colonel, how are you doing?
"
14 3 Cartman "Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
14 3 Cartman "We had a little problem.
"
14 3 Cartman "Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
14 3 Cartman "Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
14 4 Cartman "I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
14 4 Cartman "'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
14 4 Cartman "Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
14 4 Cartman "Surprise! 
"
14 4 Cartman "Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
14 4 Cartman "Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
"
14 4 Cartman "Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
14 4 Cartman "You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
14 4 Cartman "Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
14 4 Cartman "It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
14 4 Cartman "Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
14 4 Cartman "Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
14 4 Cartman "Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
14 4 Cartman "Okay let's, let's try this one.
"
14 4 Cartman "Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
14 4 Cartman "This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
14 4 Cartman "Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
14 4 Cartman "Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
14 4 Cartman "Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
14 4 Cartman "Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
14 4 Cartman "Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
14 5 Cartman "Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
"
14 5 Cartman "AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
14 5 Cartman "I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
14 5 Cartman "Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
14 5 Cartman "I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
14 5 Cartman "Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
14 5 Cartman "Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
14 5 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
14 5 Cartman "Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
14 5 Cartman "If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
14 5 Cartman "You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
14 5 Cartman "Yeah, so what?
"
14 5 Cartman "So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
14 5 Cartman "No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
"
14 5 Cartman "You just had seven tacos.
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
14 5 Cartman "You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
14 5 Cartman "Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
14 5 Cartman "I tried getting one last week!
"
14 5 Cartman "God, will somebody shut her up?
"
14 5 Cartman "I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
14 5 Cartman "Let me by...
"
14 5 Cartman "Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
14 5 Cartman "My father...
"
14 5 Cartman "I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
14 5 Cartman "How could you know anything about who my family is?
"
14 5 Cartman "If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
14 5 Cartman "Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
14 5 Cartman "I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
14 5 Cartman "I said GET. Mr. Hat!
"
14 5 Cartman "Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
14 5 Cartman "Keep... your hand... UP!
"
14 5 Cartman "By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
14 6 Cartman "That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
14 6 Cartman "Ahaaa!
"
14 6 Cartman "Nice work, Conner.
"
14 6 Cartman "Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
14 6 Cartman "Them who?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Then start explaining it to me!
"
14 6 Cartman "No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "It's all that matters!
"
14 6 Cartman "I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
14 6 Cartman "Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
14 6 Cartman "Gingers? No!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
14 6 Cartman "Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
14 6 Cartman "Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
14 6 Cartman "Daddy?
"
14 6 Cartman "Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
14 6 Cartman "Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
14 6 Cartman "What do you know?!
"
14 6 Cartman "Mom?
"
14 6 Cartman "Protect who??
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a Denver Bronco?
"
14 6 Cartman "No- nooo.
"
14 6 Cartman "No! Noooo!
"
14 6 Cartman "Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
14 6 Cartman "My dad was a ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
14 6 Cartman "What?
"
14 6 Cartman "Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
14 6 Cartman "Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
14 6 Cartman "Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
14 6 Cartman "Take it easy, Conner. 
"
14 7 Cartman "Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
14 7 Cartman "I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
14 7 Cartman "You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
14 7 Cartman "If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
"
14 8 Cartman "It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
14 8 Cartman "I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
14 8 Cartman "No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
14 8 Cartman "No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "You love NASCAR huh?
"
14 8 Cartman "You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
14 8 Cartman "I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
14 8 Cartman "You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
14 8 Cartman "But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
14 8 Cartman "Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
14 8 Cartman "I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
14 8 Cartman "I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
14 8 Cartman "Not yet.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Fucking gross!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
14 8 Cartman """Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""
"
14 8 Cartman "Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
14 8 Cartman "Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
14 8 Cartman "Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "What's that?
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
14 8 Cartman "All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
14 8 Cartman "Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
14 8 Cartman "I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
"
14 8 Cartman "Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
"
14 8 Cartman "Aw donkey balls...
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
14 8 Cartman "Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
14 8 Cartman "Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh hey, Kenny.
"
14 8 Cartman "Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
14 8 Cartman "Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
"
14 8 Cartman "I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah?
"
14 8 Cartman "...Uh oh.
"
14 8 Cartman "Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
14 8 Cartman "Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
14 8 Cartman "Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
14 8 Cartman "Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
14 8 Cartman "Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
14 8 Cartman "He's fuckin' gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
"
14 8 Cartman "Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
14 8 Cartman "Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
14 8 Cartman "Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
14 8 Cartman "Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
14 8 Cartman "You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
14 8 Cartman "Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
14 8 Cartman "I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
14 8 Cartman "Get off my car, Kenny!
"
14 8 Cartman "We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
14 8 Cartman "Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
14 8 Cartman "Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
14 8 Cartman "Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
14 8 Cartman "No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
14 8 Cartman "The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
14 8 Cartman "Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
14 9 Cartman "You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
14 9 Cartman "Oops, busted. 
"
14 9 Cartman "Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
14 9 Cartman "You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
"
14 9 Cartman "He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
14 9 Cartman "Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
"
14 9 Cartman "You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
14 9 Cartman "Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
14 9 Cartman "Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
14 9 Cartman "Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
"
14 9 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
14 9 Cartman "And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
14 9 Cartman "Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
14 9 Cartman "Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
14 9 Cartman "That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
14 9 Cartman "So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
14 9 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
14 9 Cartman "This is very serious, Butters.
"
14 9 Cartman "Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
14 9 Cartman "Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
14 9 Cartman "I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
14 9 Cartman "Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
14 9 Cartman "Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
14 9 Cartman "Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
14 9 Cartman "Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
"
14 9 Cartman "You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
14 9 Cartman "What does it want?!
"
14 9 Cartman "No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
14 9 Cartman "Thank you, Kyle.
"
14 9 Cartman "Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
14 10 Cartman "So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
14 10 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
"
14 11 Cartman "I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
14 11 Cartman "I need to speak with him, please.
"
14 11 Cartman "I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
14 11 Cartman "Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
14 11 Cartman "I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
14 11 Cartman "...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
14 11 Cartman "Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
14 11 Cartman "Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
14 11 Cartman "Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
14 11 Cartman "Asshoooles! 
"
14 14 Cartman "Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
"
14 14 Cartman "Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
14 14 Cartman "Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
14 14 Cartman "Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
14 14 Cartman "What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
14 14 Cartman "Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
