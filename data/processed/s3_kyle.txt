3 1 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, Craig.
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
3 1 Kyle "You can't do that! 
"
3 1 Kyle "Thanks!
"
3 1 Kyle "Fuck off, Cartman!
"
3 1 Kyle "No! That's a stereotype.
"
3 1 Kyle "God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "No, dude. That's a branch.
"
3 1 Kyle "No. That's the same branch again.
"
3 1 Kyle "What's the Yanogapa?
"
3 1 Kyle "My guess would be 'yes.'
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"
3 1 Kyle "Um, no.
"
3 1 Kyle "Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
"
3 1 Kyle "Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
"
3 1 Kyle "I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. It happened once before.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
"
3 1 Kyle "What the hell?
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah! Fragile my ass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! Bulldozers rule!
"
3 1 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 1 Kyle "They're... they're bastards.
"
3 1 Kyle "What?
"
3 1 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "No, I don't think so.
"
3 2 Kyle "No, that's a hair dryer!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?
"
3 2 Kyle "I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
3 2 Kyle "I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
"
3 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, I'm Jewish.
"
3 2 Kyle "I guess not.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
"
3 2 Kyle "We'll do it! We'll do it!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
"
3 2 Kyle "He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
"
3 2 Kyle "This is gonna be fun.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're too fat to be Jesus!
"
3 2 Kyle "Stan should be Jesus.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're such a fat baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "Die! 
"
3 2 Kyle "I don't know you, dude.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
"
3 2 Kyle "Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, me too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
"
3 2 Kyle "Then I can give it to my dad. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
"
3 2 Kyle "Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
3 2 Kyle "We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
"
3 2 Kyle "Jesus Christ! 
"
3 2 Kyle "(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
"
3 2 Kyle "God, that was not cool at all, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
"
3 2 Kyle "(Sick!)
"
3 2 Kyle "It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
"
3 2 Kyle "She's not worried about you.
"
3 2 Kyle "How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, take that!
"
3 2 Kyle "...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, those people are pissed!
"
3 2 Kyle "Where's your dad?
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, that was Star Trek again.
"
3 2 Kyle """The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.
"
3 2 Kyle "She's upstairs.
"
3 2 Kyle "Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, my dad is, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "I forgot all about him. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Wow!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
"
3 3 Kyle "I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
"
3 3 Kyle "Why?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Derp?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
3 3 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
"
3 3 Kyle "Moving in?!
"
3 3 Kyle "But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
3 3 Kyle "This... is insane. 
"
3 3 Kyle "That bitch!
"
3 3 Kyle "He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, so?
"
3 3 Kyle "Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
"
3 3 Kyle "Good idea.
"
3 3 Kyle "They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! Just take them off!
"
3 3 Kyle "He's a big guy, with a beard.
"
3 3 Kyle "We need you, Chef.
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef, this place isn't you!
"
3 3 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef should be here any minute.
"
3 3 Kyle "I can't believe it!
"
3 3 Kyle "All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
"
3 3 Kyle "All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
"
3 3 Kyle "That's it!
"
3 3 Kyle "This is totally what's happening!
"
3 3 Kyle "Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
3 3 Kyle "Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
"
3 3 Kyle "There he is! 
"
3 3 Kyle "We have to talk to him!
"
3 3 Kyle "What's tree-fitty?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
"
3 3 Kyle "This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
"
3 3 Kyle "I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"
3 3 Kyle "Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""
"
3 3 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 3 Kyle "Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
"
3 3 Kyle "In three hours.
"
3 3 Kyle "Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
"
3 3 Kyle "He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
"
3 3 Kyle "Bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Dirty bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Now, Cartman!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "You bastard!
"
3 3 Kyle "It's great to have you back Chef!
"
3 4 Kyle "Mr. Adler?
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
"
3 4 Kyle "Do you wanna bet?
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
"
3 4 Kyle "There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"
3 4 Kyle "So, do you agree to fight him after school?
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll see!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "What?
"
3 4 Kyle "Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek?
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, Craig showed up.
"
3 4 Kyle "And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
"
3 4 Kyle "He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"
3 4 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!!
"
3 4 Kyle "That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
3 4 Kyle "Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
"
3 4 Kyle "No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
"
3 4 Kyle "How??
"
3 4 Kyle "Not like that!
"
3 4 Kyle "Fine!
"
3 4 Kyle "Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
"
3 4 Kyle "Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
"
3 4 Kyle "This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
"
3 4 Kyle "Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
3 4 Kyle "Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
"
3 4 Kyle "Craig just called you a boner!
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Boy, do we ever.
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
"
3 5 Kyle "This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
"
3 5 Kyle "Just go behind a tree.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
"
3 5 Kyle "You just squat, stupid! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Watch out for ground eels! 
"
3 5 Kyle "What do you have to think about?
"
3 5 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 5 Kyle "What?
"
3 5 Kyle "Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
"
3 5 Kyle "Over here!
"
3 5 Kyle "It just ran by here a second ago. 
"
3 5 Kyle "It's stupid.
"
3 5 Kyle "You don't like anything, Cartman! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
"
3 5 Kyle "What are we supposed to do with him?
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
"
3 5 Kyle "What are you doing, fatass?!
"
3 5 Kyle "They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Shut up!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
"
3 5 Kyle "Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
"
3 5 Kyle "Gross! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, this sucks ass!
"
3 5 Kyle "We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
"
3 5 Kyle "There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman! Wait!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
"
3 6 Kyle "About what?
"
3 6 Kyle "This is freaking me out, dude.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad?!
"
3 6 Kyle "It's... big.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
3 6 Kyle "And you don't see a problem with that?
"
3 6 Kyle "You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
"
3 6 Kyle "I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
"
3 6 Kyle "Hey, what about that stupid panda?
"
3 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
3 6 Kyle "Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
"
3 6 Kyle "Hoh God, here we go.
"
3 6 Kyle "Isn't that fascism?
"
3 6 Kyle "Do you?
"
3 6 Kyle "What??
"
3 6 Kyle "You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
"
3 6 Kyle "No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Okay, sorry, sorry.
"
3 6 Kyle "That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
3 6 Kyle "Wait! 
"
3 8 Kyle "Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"
3 8 Kyle "Hoh, dude, weak.
"
3 8 Kyle "Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
"
3 9 Kyle "I'm coming, Ma! 
"
3 9 Kyle """Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
3 9 Kyle "I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
"
3 9 Kyle "Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
3 9 Kyle "Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
"
3 9 Kyle "...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"
3 9 Kyle "Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
"
3 9 Kyle "What? You want me to lie?
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
"
3 9 Kyle "Wow, cool.
"
3 9 Kyle "He was huge.
"
3 9 Kyle "Who are you?
"
3 9 Kyle "You have to go with him, Ike.
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kyle Broflovski.
"
3 9 Kyle "Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"
3 9 Kyle "That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
"
3 9 Kyle "This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
"
3 9 Kyle "Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
"
3 9 Kyle "That's Moses, stupid! 
"
3 9 Kyle "It's a duck. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry. I know what to do.
"
3 9 Kyle "Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
"
3 9 Kyle "He doesn't get cake?
"
3 9 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?!
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny will find a way.
"
3 9 Kyle "Go, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "What is that?
"
3 9 Kyle "Look! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! Noooooo!
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
3 9 Kyle "You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey dudes.  What are those?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
3 10 Kyle "Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
"
3 10 Kyle "Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
3 10 Kyle "What's the Primary Main Objective?
"
3 10 Kyle "Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Shit!
"
3 10 Kyle "Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
"
3 10 Kyle "I'm not sure.
"
3 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 10 Kyle "Neither do I. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh? No.
"
3 10 Kyle "Damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
"
3 10 Kyle "Camp?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
"
3 10 Kyle "God damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
3 10 Kyle "...Power.
"
3 10 Kyle "Destroy it?
"
3 10 Kyle "Liberace gay.
"
3 10 Kyle "Owatta Beikoku! 
"
3 10 Kyle "But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
3 10 Kyle "But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
"
3 11 Kyle "No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
"
3 11 Kyle "Relax, fatass.
"
3 11 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
"
3 11 Kyle "Cartman!
"
3 11 Kyle "God job, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeh-hah. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Starvin' Marvin!
"
3 11 Kyle "He did take a ship.
"
3 11 Kyle "I think he wants us to get in.
"
3 11 Kyle "Let's go somewhere. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
3 11 Kyle "No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where are we?
"
3 11 Kyle "This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
"
3 11 Kyle "No! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, no, dude!
"
3 11 Kyle "I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Watch out! Here I come!
"
3 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
3 11 Kyle "Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
"
3 11 Kyle "What was that? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, how'd we do it last time??
"
3 11 Kyle "Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
3 11 Kyle "You don't remember?!
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where did that come from??
"
3 11 Kyle "Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
"
3 11 Kyle "It's pulling us in! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Marvin... 
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
3 11 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 11 Kyle "No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
"
3 12 Kyle "Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
"
3 12 Kyle "Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
3 12 Kyle "Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
"
3 12 Kyle "The what?
"
3 12 Kyle "Nuh-uh.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"
3 12 Kyle "That's not scary, fatass!
"
3 12 Kyle "He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "Are you insane?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"
3 12 Kyle "Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
3 12 Kyle "This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't really care, dude.
"
3 12 Kyle "Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 12 Kyle "Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
"
3 12 Kyle "How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
"
3 12 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
"
3 12 Kyle "Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
"
3 12 Kyle "No Grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "She's not here!
"
3 12 Kyle "Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
3 12 Kyle "God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Then, you'll help us?
"
3 12 Kyle "Right. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wow! That was easy.
"
3 12 Kyle "Whoa. What was that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
"
3 13 Kyle "What's a ""home-schooled kid""?
"
3 13 Kyle "Wow! 
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Definition?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic.""
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!
"
3 13 Kyle "What's your name? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Wooww.
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
"
3 13 Kyle "...Uuh, can I talk to her?
"
3 13 Kyle "U-u-uh, hi. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
"
3 13 Kyle "...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
"
3 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
"
3 13 Kyle "You will?
"
3 13 Kyle "No no. I mean, go with me.
"
3 13 Kyle "You got my note?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, can we sit down?
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
"
3 13 Kyle "Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
"
3 13 Kyle "From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
3 13 Kyle "Love, for one thing.
"
3 13 Kyle "Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
3 13 Kyle "When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
3 13 Kyle "I'm not completely sure.
"
3 13 Kyle "No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
"
3 13 Kyle "I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"
3 13 Kyle "Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
"
3 13 Kyle "You suck!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca. You...
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh. All I did was show her how to-
"
3 13 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Ooww!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, you have to hit it softer!
"
3 14 Kyle "You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman!!! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
"
3 14 Kyle "You dick!
"
3 14 Kyle "He'll show.
"
3 14 Kyle "Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"
3 14 Kyle "The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
3 14 Kyle "No they're not, stupid!
"
3 14 Kyle "How much do you wanna bet?!
"
3 14 Kyle "Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
3 14 Kyle "And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
"
3 14 Kyle "You're on!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
"
3 14 Kyle "What do we do?!
"
3 14 Kyle "You cheated, Cartman!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
"
3 14 Kyle "They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
"
3 14 Kyle "I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"
3 14 Kyle "We have to stop him, dude.
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll give you 10 bucks.
"
3 14 Kyle "You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
"
3 14 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll never stop them now.
"
3 14 Kyle "Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
"
3 14 Kyle "What??
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Thanks, dick!
"
3 15 Kyle "Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"
3 15 Kyle "Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hi, Mom!
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, hi Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad? 
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "We're singing about a dreidel.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.
"
3 16 Kyle "I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
"
3 16 Kyle "What, fatass?!
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your what?
"
3 16 Kyle "Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
3 16 Kyle "Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, did you get your period yet?
"
3 16 Kyle "Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your period too, Kenny?
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
"
3 16 Kyle "Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
3 16 Kyle "Thanks a lot, Ike!
"
3 16 Kyle "You guys! I got my period, too!
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
"
3 16 Kyle "Awesome! We get powers?
"
3 16 Kyle "Here.
"
3 16 Kyle "I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
"
3 16 Kyle "Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"
3 16 Kyle "Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
"
3 16 Kyle "Phew.
"
3 16 Kyle "Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- 
"
3 16 Kyle "Hormones?
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
"
3 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 16 Kyle "Hey, here comes Stan.
"
3 16 Kyle "Did you get your period yet, Stan?
"
3 16 Kyle "How do know that?
"
3 17 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 17 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"
3 17 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
3 17 Kyle "There is no brown noise, fat boy!
"
3 17 Kyle "Who the hell are these guys?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
3 17 Kyle "Kenny?
"
3 17 Kyle "Alright, dickhole! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
"
3 17 Kyle "What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
"
3 17 Kyle "Awwgh!
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
"
3 17 Kyle "How about... finkleroy?
"
3 17 Kyle "Mung's good.
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Eewww.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
3 17 Kyle "What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"
3 17 Kyle "Calm down, Cartman.
"
3 17 Kyle "I don't believe it!
"
3 17 Kyle "That's amazing.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah, dude!
"
3 17 Kyle "We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
"
3 17 Kyle "This is gonna be sweet!
"
3 17 Kyle "Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, no!
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 1 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, Craig.
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
3 1 Kyle "You can't do that! 
"
3 1 Kyle "Thanks!
"
3 1 Kyle "Fuck off, Cartman!
"
3 1 Kyle "No! That's a stereotype.
"
3 1 Kyle "God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "No, dude. That's a branch.
"
3 1 Kyle "No. That's the same branch again.
"
3 1 Kyle "What's the Yanogapa?
"
3 1 Kyle "My guess would be 'yes.'
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"
3 1 Kyle "Um, no.
"
3 1 Kyle "Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
"
3 1 Kyle "Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
"
3 1 Kyle "I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. It happened once before.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
"
3 1 Kyle "What the hell?
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah! Fragile my ass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! Bulldozers rule!
"
3 1 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 1 Kyle "They're... they're bastards.
"
3 1 Kyle "What?
"
3 1 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "No, I don't think so.
"
3 2 Kyle "No, that's a hair dryer!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?
"
3 2 Kyle "I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
3 2 Kyle "I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
"
3 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, I'm Jewish.
"
3 2 Kyle "I guess not.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
"
3 2 Kyle "We'll do it! We'll do it!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
"
3 2 Kyle "He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
"
3 2 Kyle "This is gonna be fun.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're too fat to be Jesus!
"
3 2 Kyle "Stan should be Jesus.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're such a fat baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "Die! 
"
3 2 Kyle "I don't know you, dude.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
"
3 2 Kyle "Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, me too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
"
3 2 Kyle "Then I can give it to my dad. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
"
3 2 Kyle "Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
3 2 Kyle "We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
"
3 2 Kyle "Jesus Christ! 
"
3 2 Kyle "(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
"
3 2 Kyle "God, that was not cool at all, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
"
3 2 Kyle "(Sick!)
"
3 2 Kyle "It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
"
3 2 Kyle "She's not worried about you.
"
3 2 Kyle "How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, take that!
"
3 2 Kyle "...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, those people are pissed!
"
3 2 Kyle "Where's your dad?
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, that was Star Trek again.
"
3 2 Kyle """The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.
"
3 2 Kyle "She's upstairs.
"
3 2 Kyle "Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, my dad is, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "I forgot all about him. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Wow!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
"
3 3 Kyle "I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
"
3 3 Kyle "Why?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Derp?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
3 3 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
"
3 3 Kyle "Moving in?!
"
3 3 Kyle "But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
3 3 Kyle "This... is insane. 
"
3 3 Kyle "That bitch!
"
3 3 Kyle "He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, so?
"
3 3 Kyle "Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
"
3 3 Kyle "Good idea.
"
3 3 Kyle "They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! Just take them off!
"
3 3 Kyle "He's a big guy, with a beard.
"
3 3 Kyle "We need you, Chef.
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef, this place isn't you!
"
3 3 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef should be here any minute.
"
3 3 Kyle "I can't believe it!
"
3 3 Kyle "All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
"
3 3 Kyle "All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
"
3 3 Kyle "That's it!
"
3 3 Kyle "This is totally what's happening!
"
3 3 Kyle "Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
3 3 Kyle "Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
"
3 3 Kyle "There he is! 
"
3 3 Kyle "We have to talk to him!
"
3 3 Kyle "What's tree-fitty?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
"
3 3 Kyle "This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
"
3 3 Kyle "I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"
3 3 Kyle "Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""
"
3 3 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 3 Kyle "Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
"
3 3 Kyle "In three hours.
"
3 3 Kyle "Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
"
3 3 Kyle "He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
"
3 3 Kyle "Bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Dirty bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Now, Cartman!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "You bastard!
"
3 3 Kyle "It's great to have you back Chef!
"
3 4 Kyle "Mr. Adler?
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
"
3 4 Kyle "Do you wanna bet?
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
"
3 4 Kyle "There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"
3 4 Kyle "So, do you agree to fight him after school?
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll see!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "What?
"
3 4 Kyle "Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek?
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, Craig showed up.
"
3 4 Kyle "And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
"
3 4 Kyle "He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"
3 4 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!!
"
3 4 Kyle "That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
3 4 Kyle "Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
"
3 4 Kyle "No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
"
3 4 Kyle "How??
"
3 4 Kyle "Not like that!
"
3 4 Kyle "Fine!
"
3 4 Kyle "Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
"
3 4 Kyle "Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
"
3 4 Kyle "This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
"
3 4 Kyle "Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
3 4 Kyle "Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
"
3 4 Kyle "Craig just called you a boner!
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Boy, do we ever.
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
"
3 5 Kyle "This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
"
3 5 Kyle "Just go behind a tree.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
"
3 5 Kyle "You just squat, stupid! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Watch out for ground eels! 
"
3 5 Kyle "What do you have to think about?
"
3 5 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 5 Kyle "What?
"
3 5 Kyle "Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
"
3 5 Kyle "Over here!
"
3 5 Kyle "It just ran by here a second ago. 
"
3 5 Kyle "It's stupid.
"
3 5 Kyle "You don't like anything, Cartman! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
"
3 5 Kyle "What are we supposed to do with him?
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
"
3 5 Kyle "What are you doing, fatass?!
"
3 5 Kyle "They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Shut up!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
"
3 5 Kyle "Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
"
3 5 Kyle "Gross! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, this sucks ass!
"
3 5 Kyle "We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
"
3 5 Kyle "There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman! Wait!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
"
3 6 Kyle "About what?
"
3 6 Kyle "This is freaking me out, dude.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad?!
"
3 6 Kyle "It's... big.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
3 6 Kyle "And you don't see a problem with that?
"
3 6 Kyle "You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
"
3 6 Kyle "I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
"
3 6 Kyle "Hey, what about that stupid panda?
"
3 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
3 6 Kyle "Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
"
3 6 Kyle "Hoh God, here we go.
"
3 6 Kyle "Isn't that fascism?
"
3 6 Kyle "Do you?
"
3 6 Kyle "What??
"
3 6 Kyle "You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
"
3 6 Kyle "No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Okay, sorry, sorry.
"
3 6 Kyle "That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
3 6 Kyle "Wait! 
"
3 8 Kyle "Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"
3 8 Kyle "Hoh, dude, weak.
"
3 8 Kyle "Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
"
3 9 Kyle "I'm coming, Ma! 
"
3 9 Kyle """Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
3 9 Kyle "I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
"
3 9 Kyle "Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
3 9 Kyle "Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
"
3 9 Kyle "...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"
3 9 Kyle "Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
"
3 9 Kyle "What? You want me to lie?
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
"
3 9 Kyle "Wow, cool.
"
3 9 Kyle "He was huge.
"
3 9 Kyle "Who are you?
"
3 9 Kyle "You have to go with him, Ike.
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kyle Broflovski.
"
3 9 Kyle "Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"
3 9 Kyle "That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
"
3 9 Kyle "This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
"
3 9 Kyle "Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
"
3 9 Kyle "That's Moses, stupid! 
"
3 9 Kyle "It's a duck. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry. I know what to do.
"
3 9 Kyle "Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
"
3 9 Kyle "He doesn't get cake?
"
3 9 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?!
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny will find a way.
"
3 9 Kyle "Go, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "What is that?
"
3 9 Kyle "Look! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! Noooooo!
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
3 9 Kyle "You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey dudes.  What are those?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
3 10 Kyle "Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
"
3 10 Kyle "Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
3 10 Kyle "What's the Primary Main Objective?
"
3 10 Kyle "Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Shit!
"
3 10 Kyle "Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
"
3 10 Kyle "I'm not sure.
"
3 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 10 Kyle "Neither do I. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh? No.
"
3 10 Kyle "Damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
"
3 10 Kyle "Camp?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
"
3 10 Kyle "God damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
3 10 Kyle "...Power.
"
3 10 Kyle "Destroy it?
"
3 10 Kyle "Liberace gay.
"
3 10 Kyle "Owatta Beikoku! 
"
3 10 Kyle "But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
3 10 Kyle "But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
"
3 11 Kyle "No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
"
3 11 Kyle "Relax, fatass.
"
3 11 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
"
3 11 Kyle "Cartman!
"
3 11 Kyle "God job, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeh-hah. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Starvin' Marvin!
"
3 11 Kyle "He did take a ship.
"
3 11 Kyle "I think he wants us to get in.
"
3 11 Kyle "Let's go somewhere. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
3 11 Kyle "No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where are we?
"
3 11 Kyle "This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
"
3 11 Kyle "No! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, no, dude!
"
3 11 Kyle "I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Watch out! Here I come!
"
3 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
3 11 Kyle "Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
"
3 11 Kyle "What was that? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, how'd we do it last time??
"
3 11 Kyle "Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
3 11 Kyle "You don't remember?!
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where did that come from??
"
3 11 Kyle "Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
"
3 11 Kyle "It's pulling us in! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Marvin... 
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
3 11 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 11 Kyle "No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
"
3 12 Kyle "Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
"
3 12 Kyle "Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
3 12 Kyle "Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
"
3 12 Kyle "The what?
"
3 12 Kyle "Nuh-uh.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"
3 12 Kyle "That's not scary, fatass!
"
3 12 Kyle "He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "Are you insane?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"
3 12 Kyle "Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
3 12 Kyle "This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't really care, dude.
"
3 12 Kyle "Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 12 Kyle "Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
"
3 12 Kyle "How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
"
3 12 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
"
3 12 Kyle "Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
"
3 12 Kyle "No Grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "She's not here!
"
3 12 Kyle "Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
3 12 Kyle "God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Then, you'll help us?
"
3 12 Kyle "Right. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wow! That was easy.
"
3 12 Kyle "Whoa. What was that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
"
3 13 Kyle "What's a ""home-schooled kid""?
"
3 13 Kyle "Wow! 
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Definition?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic.""
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!
"
3 13 Kyle "What's your name? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Wooww.
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
"
3 13 Kyle "...Uuh, can I talk to her?
"
3 13 Kyle "U-u-uh, hi. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
"
3 13 Kyle "...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
"
3 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
"
3 13 Kyle "You will?
"
3 13 Kyle "No no. I mean, go with me.
"
3 13 Kyle "You got my note?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, can we sit down?
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
"
3 13 Kyle "Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
"
3 13 Kyle "From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
3 13 Kyle "Love, for one thing.
"
3 13 Kyle "Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
3 13 Kyle "When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
3 13 Kyle "I'm not completely sure.
"
3 13 Kyle "No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
"
3 13 Kyle "I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"
3 13 Kyle "Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
"
3 13 Kyle "You suck!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca. You...
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh. All I did was show her how to-
"
3 13 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Ooww!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, you have to hit it softer!
"
3 14 Kyle "You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman!!! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
"
3 14 Kyle "You dick!
"
3 14 Kyle "He'll show.
"
3 14 Kyle "Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"
3 14 Kyle "The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
3 14 Kyle "No they're not, stupid!
"
3 14 Kyle "How much do you wanna bet?!
"
3 14 Kyle "Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
3 14 Kyle "And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
"
3 14 Kyle "You're on!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
"
3 14 Kyle "What do we do?!
"
3 14 Kyle "You cheated, Cartman!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
"
3 14 Kyle "They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
"
3 14 Kyle "I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"
3 14 Kyle "We have to stop him, dude.
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll give you 10 bucks.
"
3 14 Kyle "You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
"
3 14 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll never stop them now.
"
3 14 Kyle "Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
"
3 14 Kyle "What??
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Thanks, dick!
"
3 15 Kyle "Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"
3 15 Kyle "Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hi, Mom!
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, hi Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad? 
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "We're singing about a dreidel.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.
"
3 16 Kyle "I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
"
3 16 Kyle "What, fatass?!
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your what?
"
3 16 Kyle "Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
3 16 Kyle "Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, did you get your period yet?
"
3 16 Kyle "Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your period too, Kenny?
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
"
3 16 Kyle "Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
3 16 Kyle "Thanks a lot, Ike!
"
3 16 Kyle "You guys! I got my period, too!
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
"
3 16 Kyle "Awesome! We get powers?
"
3 16 Kyle "Here.
"
3 16 Kyle "I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
"
3 16 Kyle "Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"
3 16 Kyle "Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
"
3 16 Kyle "Phew.
"
3 16 Kyle "Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- 
"
3 16 Kyle "Hormones?
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
"
3 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 16 Kyle "Hey, here comes Stan.
"
3 16 Kyle "Did you get your period yet, Stan?
"
3 16 Kyle "How do know that?
"
3 17 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 17 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"
3 17 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
3 17 Kyle "There is no brown noise, fat boy!
"
3 17 Kyle "Who the hell are these guys?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
3 17 Kyle "Kenny?
"
3 17 Kyle "Alright, dickhole! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
"
3 17 Kyle "What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
"
3 17 Kyle "Awwgh!
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
"
3 17 Kyle "How about... finkleroy?
"
3 17 Kyle "Mung's good.
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Eewww.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
3 17 Kyle "What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"
3 17 Kyle "Calm down, Cartman.
"
3 17 Kyle "I don't believe it!
"
3 17 Kyle "That's amazing.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah, dude!
"
3 17 Kyle "We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
"
3 17 Kyle "This is gonna be sweet!
"
3 17 Kyle "Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, no!
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 1 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, Craig.
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
3 1 Kyle "You can't do that! 
"
3 1 Kyle "Thanks!
"
3 1 Kyle "Fuck off, Cartman!
"
3 1 Kyle "No! That's a stereotype.
"
3 1 Kyle "God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "No, dude. That's a branch.
"
3 1 Kyle "No. That's the same branch again.
"
3 1 Kyle "What's the Yanogapa?
"
3 1 Kyle "My guess would be 'yes.'
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
3 1 Kyle "Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"
3 1 Kyle "Um, no.
"
3 1 Kyle "Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
"
3 1 Kyle "Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
"
3 1 Kyle "I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah. It happened once before.
"
3 1 Kyle "Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
"
3 1 Kyle "What the hell?
"
3 1 Kyle "Yeah! Fragile my ass!
"
3 1 Kyle "Dude! Bulldozers rule!
"
3 1 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 1 Kyle "They're... they're bastards.
"
3 1 Kyle "What?
"
3 1 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "No, I don't think so.
"
3 2 Kyle "No, that's a hair dryer!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?
"
3 2 Kyle "I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
3 2 Kyle "I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
"
3 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, I'm Jewish.
"
3 2 Kyle "I guess not.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
"
3 2 Kyle "We'll do it! We'll do it!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
"
3 2 Kyle "He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
"
3 2 Kyle "This is gonna be fun.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're too fat to be Jesus!
"
3 2 Kyle "Stan should be Jesus.
"
3 2 Kyle "You're such a fat baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
"
3 2 Kyle "Die! 
"
3 2 Kyle "I don't know you, dude.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
"
3 2 Kyle "Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, me too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
"
3 2 Kyle "Then I can give it to my dad. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
"
3 2 Kyle "Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
3 2 Kyle "We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
"
3 2 Kyle "Jesus Christ! 
"
3 2 Kyle "(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
"
3 2 Kyle "God, that was not cool at all, dude!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
"
3 2 Kyle "(Sick!)
"
3 2 Kyle "It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"
3 2 Kyle "Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
"
3 2 Kyle "She's not worried about you.
"
3 2 Kyle "How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
"
3 2 Kyle "Yeah, take that!
"
3 2 Kyle "...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, those people are pissed!
"
3 2 Kyle "Where's your dad?
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude, that was Star Trek again.
"
3 2 Kyle """The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.
"
3 2 Kyle "She's upstairs.
"
3 2 Kyle "Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Well, my dad is, too.
"
3 2 Kyle "I forgot all about him. 
"
3 2 Kyle "Wow!
"
3 2 Kyle "Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
"
3 3 Kyle "I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
"
3 3 Kyle "Why?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Derp?
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
3 3 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
"
3 3 Kyle "Moving in?!
"
3 3 Kyle "But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
3 3 Kyle "This... is insane. 
"
3 3 Kyle "That bitch!
"
3 3 Kyle "He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah, so?
"
3 3 Kyle "Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
"
3 3 Kyle "Good idea.
"
3 3 Kyle "They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
"
3 3 Kyle "Dude! Just take them off!
"
3 3 Kyle "He's a big guy, with a beard.
"
3 3 Kyle "We need you, Chef.
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef, this place isn't you!
"
3 3 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 3 Kyle "Chef should be here any minute.
"
3 3 Kyle "I can't believe it!
"
3 3 Kyle "All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
"
3 3 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
"
3 3 Kyle "All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
"
3 3 Kyle "That's it!
"
3 3 Kyle "This is totally what's happening!
"
3 3 Kyle "Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
3 3 Kyle "Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
"
3 3 Kyle "There he is! 
"
3 3 Kyle "We have to talk to him!
"
3 3 Kyle "What's tree-fitty?
"
3 3 Kyle "Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
"
3 3 Kyle "This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"
3 3 Kyle "Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
"
3 3 Kyle "I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"
3 3 Kyle "Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""
"
3 3 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 3 Kyle "Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
"
3 3 Kyle "In three hours.
"
3 3 Kyle "Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
"
3 3 Kyle "He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
"
3 3 Kyle "Bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Dirty bitch.
"
3 3 Kyle "Now, Cartman!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
"
3 3 Kyle "You bastard!
"
3 3 Kyle "It's great to have you back Chef!
"
3 4 Kyle "Mr. Adler?
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
"
3 4 Kyle "Do you wanna bet?
"
3 4 Kyle "Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
"
3 4 Kyle "There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"
3 4 Kyle "So, do you agree to fight him after school?
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll see!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "What?
"
3 4 Kyle "Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek?
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, Craig showed up.
"
3 4 Kyle "And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
"
3 4 Kyle "Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
"
3 4 Kyle "He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"
3 4 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!!
"
3 4 Kyle "That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
"
3 4 Kyle "Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
3 4 Kyle "Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
"
3 4 Kyle "No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
"
3 4 Kyle "How??
"
3 4 Kyle "Not like that!
"
3 4 Kyle "Fine!
"
3 4 Kyle "Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
"
3 4 Kyle "Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
"
3 4 Kyle "This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
"
3 4 Kyle "Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
3 4 Kyle "Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
"
3 4 Kyle "Craig just called you a boner!
"
3 4 Kyle "We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
"
3 4 Kyle "You bastards!
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
3 4 Kyle "Boy, do we ever.
"
3 4 Kyle "Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
"
3 5 Kyle "This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
"
3 5 Kyle "Just go behind a tree.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
"
3 5 Kyle "You just squat, stupid! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Watch out for ground eels! 
"
3 5 Kyle "What do you have to think about?
"
3 5 Kyle "No way, dude!
"
3 5 Kyle "What?
"
3 5 Kyle "Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
"
3 5 Kyle "Over here!
"
3 5 Kyle "It just ran by here a second ago. 
"
3 5 Kyle "It's stupid.
"
3 5 Kyle "You don't like anything, Cartman! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
"
3 5 Kyle "What are we supposed to do with him?
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
"
3 5 Kyle "What are you doing, fatass?!
"
3 5 Kyle "They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Shut up!!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
"
3 5 Kyle "Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
"
3 5 Kyle "Gross! 
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude, this sucks ass!
"
3 5 Kyle "We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
"
3 5 Kyle "There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
3 5 Kyle "Cartman! Wait!
"
3 5 Kyle "Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
"
3 6 Kyle "About what?
"
3 6 Kyle "This is freaking me out, dude.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad?!
"
3 6 Kyle "It's... big.
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
3 6 Kyle "And you don't see a problem with that?
"
3 6 Kyle "You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
"
3 6 Kyle "I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
"
3 6 Kyle "Hey, what about that stupid panda?
"
3 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 6 Kyle "Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
3 6 Kyle "Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
"
3 6 Kyle "Hoh God, here we go.
"
3 6 Kyle "Isn't that fascism?
"
3 6 Kyle "Do you?
"
3 6 Kyle "What??
"
3 6 Kyle "You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
"
3 6 Kyle "No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
3 6 Kyle "Okay, sorry, sorry.
"
3 6 Kyle "That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
3 6 Kyle "Wait! 
"
3 8 Kyle "Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"
3 8 Kyle "Hoh, dude, weak.
"
3 8 Kyle "Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
"
3 9 Kyle "I'm coming, Ma! 
"
3 9 Kyle """Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
3 9 Kyle "I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
"
3 9 Kyle "Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
3 9 Kyle "Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
"
3 9 Kyle "...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"
3 9 Kyle "Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
3 9 Kyle "No, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
"
3 9 Kyle "What? You want me to lie?
"
3 9 Kyle "Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
"
3 9 Kyle "Wow, cool.
"
3 9 Kyle "He was huge.
"
3 9 Kyle "Who are you?
"
3 9 Kyle "You have to go with him, Ike.
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kyle Broflovski.
"
3 9 Kyle "Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"
3 9 Kyle "That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
"
3 9 Kyle "This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
"
3 9 Kyle "This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
"
3 9 Kyle "It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
"
3 9 Kyle "Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
"
3 9 Kyle "That's Moses, stupid! 
"
3 9 Kyle "It's a duck. 
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry. I know what to do.
"
3 9 Kyle "Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
"
3 9 Kyle "He doesn't get cake?
"
3 9 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?!
"
3 9 Kyle "Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny will find a way.
"
3 9 Kyle "Go, Ike!
"
3 9 Kyle "What is that?
"
3 9 Kyle "Look! 
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! Noooooo!
"
3 9 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
3 9 Kyle "You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey dudes.  What are those?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
3 10 Kyle "Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
"
3 10 Kyle "Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
3 10 Kyle "What's the Primary Main Objective?
"
3 10 Kyle "Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Shit!
"
3 10 Kyle "Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
"
3 10 Kyle "I'm not sure.
"
3 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
"
3 10 Kyle "Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
"
3 10 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 10 Kyle "Neither do I. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Huh? No.
"
3 10 Kyle "Damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
"
3 10 Kyle "Camp?
"
3 10 Kyle "No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
"
3 10 Kyle "Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
3 10 Kyle "What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
"
3 10 Kyle "God damnit! 
"
3 10 Kyle "...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
3 10 Kyle "...Power.
"
3 10 Kyle "Destroy it?
"
3 10 Kyle "Liberace gay.
"
3 10 Kyle "Owatta Beikoku! 
"
3 10 Kyle "But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "What?
"
3 10 Kyle "Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
"
3 10 Kyle "So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
3 10 Kyle "But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
"
3 10 Kyle "Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
"
3 11 Kyle "No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
"
3 11 Kyle "Relax, fatass.
"
3 11 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
"
3 11 Kyle "Cartman!
"
3 11 Kyle "God job, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeh-hah. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Starvin' Marvin!
"
3 11 Kyle "He did take a ship.
"
3 11 Kyle "I think he wants us to get in.
"
3 11 Kyle "Let's go somewhere. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
3 11 Kyle "No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where are we?
"
3 11 Kyle "This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
"
3 11 Kyle "Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
"
3 11 Kyle "No! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Oh, no, dude!
"
3 11 Kyle "I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"
3 11 Kyle "Watch out! Here I come!
"
3 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
3 11 Kyle "Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
"
3 11 Kyle "What was that? 
"
3 11 Kyle "Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
"
3 11 Kyle "Well, how'd we do it last time??
"
3 11 Kyle "Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
3 11 Kyle "You don't remember?!
"
3 11 Kyle "Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Where did that come from??
"
3 11 Kyle "Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
"
3 11 Kyle "It's pulling us in! 
"
3 11 Kyle "Marvin... 
"
3 11 Kyle "Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
3 11 Kyle "Thanks.
"
3 11 Kyle "No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
"
3 12 Kyle "Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
"
3 12 Kyle "Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
3 12 Kyle "Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
"
3 12 Kyle "The what?
"
3 12 Kyle "Nuh-uh.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"
3 12 Kyle "That's not scary, fatass!
"
3 12 Kyle "He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "Are you insane?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"
3 12 Kyle "Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
3 12 Kyle "This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"
3 12 Kyle "I don't really care, dude.
"
3 12 Kyle "Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 12 Kyle "Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
"
3 12 Kyle "How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"
3 12 Kyle "Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
"
3 12 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
"
3 12 Kyle "Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
"
3 12 Kyle "No Grandma??
"
3 12 Kyle "She's not here!
"
3 12 Kyle "Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
3 12 Kyle "God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
3 12 Kyle "Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
3 12 Kyle "Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Then, you'll help us?
"
3 12 Kyle "Right. 
"
3 12 Kyle "Wow! That was easy.
"
3 12 Kyle "Whoa. What was that?
"
3 12 Kyle "Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
"
3 13 Kyle "What's a ""home-schooled kid""?
"
3 13 Kyle "Wow! 
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Definition?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic.""
"
3 13 Kyle """Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!
"
3 13 Kyle "What's your name? 
"
3 13 Kyle "Wooww.
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
"
3 13 Kyle "...Uuh, can I talk to her?
"
3 13 Kyle "U-u-uh, hi. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
"
3 13 Kyle "...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
"
3 13 Kyle "What??
"
3 13 Kyle "Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
3 13 Kyle "Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
"
3 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
"
3 13 Kyle "You will?
"
3 13 Kyle "No no. I mean, go with me.
"
3 13 Kyle "You got my note?
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh, can we sit down?
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
"
3 13 Kyle "Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
"
3 13 Kyle "From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
3 13 Kyle "Love, for one thing.
"
3 13 Kyle "Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
3 13 Kyle "When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
3 13 Kyle "I'm not completely sure.
"
3 13 Kyle "No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
"
3 13 Kyle "Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
"
3 13 Kyle "I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"
3 13 Kyle "Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
"
3 13 Kyle "You suck!
"
3 13 Kyle "Rebecca. You...
"
3 13 Kyle "Uh. All I did was show her how to-
"
3 13 Kyle "Aaaah!
"
3 13 Kyle "Ooww!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, you have to hit it softer!
"
3 14 Kyle "You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
"
3 14 Kyle "Cartman!!! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
"
3 14 Kyle "You dick!
"
3 14 Kyle "He'll show.
"
3 14 Kyle "Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"
3 14 Kyle "The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
3 14 Kyle "No they're not, stupid!
"
3 14 Kyle "How much do you wanna bet?!
"
3 14 Kyle "Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
3 14 Kyle "And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
"
3 14 Kyle "You're on!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
"
3 14 Kyle "What do we do?!
"
3 14 Kyle "You cheated, Cartman!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
"
3 14 Kyle "They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
"
3 14 Kyle "I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
"
3 14 Kyle "Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"
3 14 Kyle "We have to stop him, dude.
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll give you 10 bucks.
"
3 14 Kyle "You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
"
3 14 Kyle "Hey!
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
"
3 14 Kyle "We'll never stop them now.
"
3 14 Kyle "Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
"
3 14 Kyle "Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
"
3 14 Kyle "Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
"
3 14 Kyle "What??
"
3 14 Kyle "Yeah. Thanks, dick!
"
3 15 Kyle "Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"
3 15 Kyle "Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hi, Mom!
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, hi Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad? 
"
3 15 Kyle "Dad.
"
3 15 Kyle "We're singing about a dreidel.
"
3 15 Kyle "Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "I made you out of clay.
"
3 15 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3 15 Kyle "with dreidel I shall play.
"
3 15 Kyle "Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.
"
3 16 Kyle "I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
"
3 16 Kyle "What, fatass?!
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your what?
"
3 16 Kyle "Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
3 16 Kyle "Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, did you get your period yet?
"
3 16 Kyle "Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah.
"
3 16 Kyle "You got your period too, Kenny?
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
3 16 Kyle "Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
"
3 16 Kyle "Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
3 16 Kyle "Thanks a lot, Ike!
"
3 16 Kyle "You guys! I got my period, too!
"
3 16 Kyle "Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
"
3 16 Kyle "Awesome! We get powers?
"
3 16 Kyle "Here.
"
3 16 Kyle "I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
"
3 16 Kyle "Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"
3 16 Kyle "Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
"
3 16 Kyle "Phew.
"
3 16 Kyle "Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- 
"
3 16 Kyle "Hormones?
"
3 16 Kyle "Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
"
3 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
3 16 Kyle "Hey, here comes Stan.
"
3 16 Kyle "Did you get your period yet, Stan?
"
3 16 Kyle "How do know that?
"
3 17 Kyle "Shut up, fatass!
"
3 17 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"
3 17 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
3 17 Kyle "There is no brown noise, fat boy!
"
3 17 Kyle "Who the hell are these guys?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
3 17 Kyle "Kenny?
"
3 17 Kyle "Alright, dickhole! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
"
3 17 Kyle "What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
"
3 17 Kyle "Awwgh!
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
"
3 17 Kyle "How about... finkleroy?
"
3 17 Kyle "Mung's good.
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
"
3 17 Kyle "Eewww.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
3 17 Kyle "What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"
3 17 Kyle "Calm down, Cartman.
"
3 17 Kyle "I don't believe it!
"
3 17 Kyle "That's amazing.
"
3 17 Kyle "Yeah, dude!
"
3 17 Kyle "We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
"
3 17 Kyle "This is gonna be sweet!
"
3 17 Kyle "Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
"
3 17 Kyle "Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
3 17 Kyle "Oh, no!
"
3 17 Kyle "Huh?
"
