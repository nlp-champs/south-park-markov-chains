1 1 Stan "What's a dildo?
"
1 1 Stan "What's a dildo, Kenny?
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude! Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors are real.
"
1 1 Stan "What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
1 1 Stan "They took him on their ship.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, don't worry about him.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
"
1 1 Stan "I said I have a bad itch.
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"
1 1 Stan "Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Damn, Cartman!
"
1 1 Stan "It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
"
1 1 Stan "How can you eat when you're farting fire?
"
1 1 Stan "Where? 
"
1 1 Stan "Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
"
1 1 Stan "I do not!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
"
1 1 Stan "What? How do you know she has a cat? 
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa! 
"
1 1 Stan "Killer! Thanks, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
"
1 1 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
1 1 Stan "Kyle, look! It's them.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.
"
1 1 Stan "Owww.
"
1 1 Stan "Wow, poor Kenny.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
"
1 1 Stan "But her note said she'd be here. 
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
"
1 1 Stan "Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
"
1 1 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
1 1 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
1 1 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, it's happening again. 
"
1 1 Stan "Now, do you believe this, Cartman?
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 1 Stan "That was beautiful, dude.
"
1 1 Stan "No, they're leaving.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 
"
1 1 Stan "Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 1 Stan "Thanks for your help, Wendy.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, I didn't throw up.
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech! 
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 1 Stan "Cool.
"
1 1 Stan "I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
"
1 1 Stan "That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
"
1 1 Stan "I don't know what the hell that is...
"
1 1 Stan "Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
"
1 1 Stan "I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, hey Cartman.
"
1 1 Stan "Really, what about?
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, it was huge.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
"
1 2 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "What were you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
1 2 Stan "We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins are way smarter than you!
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
"
1 2 Stan "Tell me what you wrote about!
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
"
1 2 Stan "What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
"
1 2 Stan "What's that stuff?
"
1 2 Stan "Superfatass?
"
1 2 Stan "Take that you stupid Indian! 
"
1 2 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, look! 
"
1 2 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
1 2 Stan "Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
"
1 2 Stan "Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
"
1 2 Stan "Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
"
1 2 Stan "We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
"
1 3 Stan "You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
"
1 3 Stan "My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
"
1 3 Stan "Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
"
1 3 Stan "Is this hunting?
"
1 3 Stan "I can't. 
"
1 3 Stan "I don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I can shoot you, fat ass!
"
1 3 Stan "I'll kill you!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, Cartman's pee.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
"
1 3 Stan "Whatabutt?
"
1 3 Stan "Why?
"
1 3 Stan "A hook.
"
1 3 Stan "Celery?
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"
1 3 Stan "What, dude?
"
1 3 Stan "Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
"
1 3 Stan "With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
"
1 3 Stan "What? 
"
1 3 Stan "Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 3 Stan "Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
"
1 3 Stan "No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
"
1 3 Stan "I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
"
1 3 Stan "Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman?
"
1 3 Stan "Whoa, he built a wicker basket
"
1 3 Stan "I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, that was easy!
"
1 3 Stan "What?! Why?!
"
1 3 Stan "No.
"
1 3 Stan "But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
"
1 4 Stan "Hiya, Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
"
1 4 Stan "Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
"
1 4 Stan "He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
"
1 4 Stan "He's not meaner than Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky'll kick his ass.
"
1 4 Stan "That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky, bad dog!
"
1 4 Stan "What?!
"
1 4 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 4 Stan "He's just confused.
"
1 4 Stan "Sick, shut up dude. 
"
1 4 Stan "Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
"
1 4 Stan "Huh? 
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
"
1 4 Stan "Get down Sparky! Down!
"
1 4 Stan "Um, I'm not really prepared either.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, cool!
"
1 4 Stan "Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
"
1 4 Stan "What's a - homosexual?
"
1 4 Stan "I guess.
"
1 4 Stan "Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
"
1 4 Stan "He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on you guys, I have an idea.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
"
1 4 Stan "Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
"
1 4 Stan "I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
"
1 4 Stan "Like who?
"
1 4 Stan "Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
"
1 4 Stan "Damn it!
"
1 4 Stan "I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
"
1 4 Stan "Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
"
1 4 Stan "No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
"
1 4 Stan "I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
"
1 4 Stan "Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
"
1 4 Stan "I think he might've run away.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Sparky!
"
1 4 Stan "Fine, how are you?
"
1 4 Stan "My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
"
1 4 Stan "D'you have lots of gay dogs here?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
"
1 4 Stan "I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
"
1 4 Stan "What don't I understand?
"
1 4 Stan "This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
"
1 4 Stan "Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!
"
1 4 Stan "No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
"
1 4 Stan "I will Big Gay Al, I will. 
"
1 4 Stan "I've been getting my best friend back.
"
1 4 Stan "Hike!
"
1 4 Stan "Mph. 
"
1 4 Stan "Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
"
1 4 Stan "And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
"
1 4 Stan "And it's okay to be gay! 
"
1 4 Stan "Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
"
1 4 Stan "I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
"
1 4 Stan "But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
"
1 4 Stan "Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 5 Stan "Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
"
1 5 Stan "No!
"
1 5 Stan "She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
"
1 5 Stan "My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
"
1 5 Stan "Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 5 Stan "Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
"
1 5 Stan "Wow, that's cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
"
1 5 Stan "That'd be cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "Okay.
"
1 5 Stan "Yes…
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, neither.  It's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Hi Shelly.
"
1 5 Stan "Headgear?  What headgear?
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
"
1 5 Stan "Go where?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, quit being such a baby.
"
1 5 Stan "At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
"
1 5 Stan "Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
"
1 5 Stan "Ow!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah! Go away, Pip!
"
1 5 Stan "I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "So how do we do that?
"
1 5 Stan "Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
"
1 5 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 5 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
"
1 5 Stan "Sick dude, she's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Crap.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
"
1 5 Stan "Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
"
1 5 Stan "Sick!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
"
1 5 Stan "Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "A big mutant version of me?
"
1 5 Stan "I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
"
1 5 Stan "Oh my God!
"
1 5 Stan "Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
"
1 5 Stan "It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
"
1 5 Stan "Stop!
"
1 5 Stan "That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
"
1 5 Stan "Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
"
1 5 Stan "…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
"
1 5 Stan "No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
"
1 5 Stan "Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
"
1 5 Stan "You can't just leave me here alone.
"
1 5 Stan "Thanks a lot.
"
1 5 Stan "It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
"
1 5 Stan "Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
"
1 6 Stan "It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
"
1 6 Stan "Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
"
1 6 Stan "Aw, dammit!
"
1 6 Stan "Heheheh hehehe...
"
1 6 Stan "My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure.
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "Leave me alone grampa. 
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not going to kill you grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Good night grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
"
1 6 Stan "Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
"
1 6 Stan "My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
"
1 6 Stan "Really??
"
1 6 Stan "Wow!
"
1 6 Stan "So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
"
1 6 Stan "Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah...
"
1 6 Stan "Hey Chef.
"
1 6 Stan "Bad.
"
1 6 Stan "Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "No, I mean, kill my grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "See, I told you dude.
"
1 6 Stan "What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
"
1 6 Stan "Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
"
1 6 Stan "No grampa, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "No, I can't even kill a deer.
"
1 6 Stan "Grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
"
1 6 Stan "We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
"
1 6 Stan "Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, yeah!
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus?
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
"
1 6 Stan "Yes?
"
1 6 Stan "Goddammit!
"
1 6 Stan "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
1 6 Stan "Kyle, don't be such a butthole!
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
"
1 6 Stan "We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
"
1 6 Stan "Aaah!! 
"
1 6 Stan "We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
"
1 6 Stan "Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
"
1 6 Stan "Aww, do I have to?
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, what are you doing?! 
"
1 6 Stan "Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
"
1 6 Stan "Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
"
1 6 Stan "Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure I will grampa, I will.
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
"
1 6 Stan "'Kay, come on guys. 
"
1 6 Stan "You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
"
1 6 Stan "Are you ready grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
"
1 6 Stan "What is that?!
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, he's coming towards us.
"
1 6 Stan "Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah, but, mom!
"
1 6 Stan "Dad, Death is coming!
"
1 6 Stan "Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
"
1 6 Stan "Totally dude.
"
1 6 Stan "Quick, jump through the window.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey look!
"
1 6 Stan "Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on you guys, let's go home. 
"
1 6 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
"
1 6 Stan "Cool!
"
1 6 Stan "What are you doing grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "That's my silly grampa. 
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
"
1 7 Stan "Shut up Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "I'm Raggedy Andy.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
"
1 7 Stan "Where'd you get that?
"
1 7 Stan "No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!
"
1 7 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
"
1 7 Stan "Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
"
1 7 Stan "I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank.""
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
"
1 7 Stan "We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
"
1 7 Stan "You what?!
"
1 7 Stan "He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, where's Kyle?
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, me too.
"
1 7 Stan "Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
"
1 7 Stan "I bet I get more candy than you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
"
1 7 Stan "Plastic pumpkin pails...
"
1 7 Stan "Taser... 
"
1 7 Stan "For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
"
1 7 Stan "How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
"
1 7 Stan "Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
"
1 7 Stan "No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
"
1 7 Stan "What are you talking about Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God, that means...
"
1 7 Stan "Wait, where are we going?
"
1 7 Stan "I don't know about this Chef.
"
1 7 Stan "What are we doing here Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "What?
"
1 7 Stan "We told you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey Chef. Look.
"
1 7 Stan "Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 
"
1 7 Stan "Let's get out of here! 
"
1 7 Stan "We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
"
1 7 Stan "You call the number Kyle.
"
1 7 Stan "We'll hold 'em off.
"
1 7 Stan "Sweet! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "I know, but uh-... but...
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, yeah! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
"
1 7 Stan "I, I can't.
"
1 7 Stan "Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
"
1 7 Stan "That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
"
1 7 Stan "You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 7 Stan "Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
"
1 8 Stan "That was awesome!
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, who's that fat chick?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
"
1 8 Stan "SWEET!
"
1 8 Stan "I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
"
1 8 Stan "Just a second fat-ass!
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
"
1 8 Stan "You mean, like Kenny?
"
1 8 Stan "Damn.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
"
1 8 Stan "I think he said his name is Marvin.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
"
1 8 Stan "It was my mom's credit card.
"
1 8 Stan "This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
"
1 8 Stan "Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, yeah, we do!
"
1 8 Stan "He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
"
1 8 Stan "He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "No.
"
1 8 Stan "So why can't he live here now?
"
1 8 Stan "This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 
"
1 8 Stan "Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
"
1 8 Stan "We did it!! 
"
1 8 Stan "Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
"
1 8 Stan "You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
"
1 9 Stan "Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
"
1 9 Stan "Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
"
1 9 Stan "Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Stan "Whoa, Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Stan "That was sick, dude!
"
1 9 Stan "...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
"
1 9 Stan "Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
"
1 9 Stan "We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Stan "Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "See you around, dude. 
"
1 9 Stan "The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
"
1 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 9 Stan "You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
"
1 9 Stan "'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
"
1 9 Stan "What's that?
"
1 9 Stan "What's in the box, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, sick!!! 
"
1 9 Stan "Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
"
1 9 Stan "Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
"
1 9 Stan "I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
"
1 9 Stan "This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
"
1 9 Stan "We committed him.
"
1 9 Stan "Huh?!  O-oh.
"
1 9 Stan "This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Stan "I believe. 
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 9 Stan "You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
"
1 9 Stan "Wh-what could it be? 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
"
1 10 Stan "Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
"
1 10 Stan "Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
"
1 10 Stan "Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
"
1 10 Stan "What the...&#160;?
"
1 10 Stan "A what?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus, Jesus!
"
1 10 Stan "Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
"
1 10 Stan "This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "You're gonna fight Satan?
"
1 10 Stan "I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
"
1 10 Stan "Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
"
1 10 Stan "Did the Devil show up yet?
"
1 10 Stan "Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
"
1 10 Stan "Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
"
1 10 Stan "Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
"
1 10 Stan "Bubye, Fartboy.
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
"
1 10 Stan "Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
"
1 10 Stan "But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, that was cool! 
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
"
1 10 Stan "Aaanh, he does this all the time.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
"
1 10 Stan "Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
"
1 10 Stan "She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
"
1 10 Stan "What?
"
1 10 Stan "... Really?
"
1 10 Stan "Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
"
1 10 Stan "You did, Jesus. 
"
1 10 Stan "Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
"
1 10 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
1 10 Stan "You're leaving already?
"
1 10 Stan "Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
"
1 11 Stan "I know.
"
1 11 Stan "I can't afford a cruise, dude.
"
1 11 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 11 Stan "You can say that again.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeu-bluuuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuch 
"
1 11 Stan "You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah, that one!
"
1 11 Stan "No.
"
1 11 Stan "Sure, Wendy, whatever.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch! I'd love to. 
"
1 11 Stan "That's not Kyle's...
"
1 11 Stan "We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
"
1 11 Stan "Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "See? She liked my present the best!
"
1 11 Stan "No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
"
1 11 Stan "I bet I scored 100!
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "That's impossible!
"
1 11 Stan "What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
"
1 11 Stan "A whatbian?
"
1 11 Stan "Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.
"
1 11 Stan "Oh.
"
1 11 Stan "Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
"
1 11 Stan "You're just saying that, Cartman.
"
1 11 Stan "What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
"
1 11 Stan "Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
"
1 11 Stan "I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
"
1 11 Stan "No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. Hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. Kick ass!
"
1 11 Stan "Are we making love now?
"
1 11 Stan "They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
"
1 11 Stan "You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
"
1 11 Stan "But why?
"
1 11 Stan "It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
"
1 11 Stan "I think so.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Did I what?
"
1 11 Stan "Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
"
1 11 Stan "Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuuch! 
"
1 11 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 12 Stan "Isn't that your job?
"
1 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
1 12 Stan "Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "What is it?
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 12 Stan "What are you going to do with it, dude?
"
1 12 Stan "You did throw it away, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "Well, you might as well let it go.
"
1 12 Stan "I have a button we can use for his nose.
"
1 12 Stan "Ow, that sucks, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "...so?
"
1 12 Stan "Like John Elway important?
"
1 12 Stan "D'you know John Elway?
"
1 12 Stan "Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
"
1 12 Stan "Why do you wanta know, lady?!
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "It's Saturday.
"
1 12 Stan "Man, the bus sure is late.
"
1 12 Stan "Fine.
"
1 12 Stan "Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, let us go!
"
1 12 Stan "Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 12 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 12 Stan "Get us down from here!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith? Sweet!
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1 12 Stan "My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
"
1 12 Stan "Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
"
1 12 Stan "Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
"
1 12 Stan "He did it!
"
1 12 Stan "Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
"
1 12 Stan "Good-bye, Robert Smith!
"
1 12 Stan "Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
"
1 12 Stan "Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
"
1 12 Stan "Go to hell, Cartman!
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God! Look! 
"
1 13 Stan "Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
"
1 13 Stan "Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
"
1 13 Stan "We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
"
1 13 Stan "I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
"
1 13 Stan "I always wondered if that would work.
"
1 13 Stan "In the backyard?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 13 Stan "No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
"
1 13 Stan "Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
"
1 13 Stan "No.
"
1 13 Stan "Is that legal?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
"
1 13 Stan "I donnow, just keep rolling.
"
1 13 Stan "Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
"
1 13 Stan "Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
"
1 13 Stan "Aaawww.
"
1 13 Stan "This guy sucks! 
"
1 13 Stan "Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
"
1 13 Stan "What?? 
"
1 13 Stan "What are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
1 13 Stan "Go ahead, dude. 
"
1 13 Stan "Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
"
1 13 Stan "Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
"
1 13 Stan "Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
"
1 13 Stan "Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
"
1 13 Stan "Cartman?!
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
"
1 13 Stan "Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
"
1 13 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
"
1 13 Stan "Huh?  Oh yeah.
"
1 13 Stan "How 'bout some ice cream?
"
1 13 Stan "Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
"
1 13 Stan "Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! 
"
1 13 Stan "Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
"
1 13 Stan "How's it going, Cartman?
"
1 13 Stan "Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
"
1 13 Stan "Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
"
1 13 Stan "Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
"
1 13 Stan "Uh, yyeah.
"
1 13 Stan "Uuh, you'll see.
"
1 13 Stan "We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
"
1 13 Stan "Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
"
1 13 Stan "Dude. We lost.
"
1 13 Stan "Grampa!! 
"
1 13 Stan "Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
"
1 1 Stan "What's a dildo?
"
1 1 Stan "What's a dildo, Kenny?
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude! Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors are real.
"
1 1 Stan "What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
1 1 Stan "They took him on their ship.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, don't worry about him.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
"
1 1 Stan "I said I have a bad itch.
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"
1 1 Stan "Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Damn, Cartman!
"
1 1 Stan "It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
"
1 1 Stan "How can you eat when you're farting fire?
"
1 1 Stan "Where? 
"
1 1 Stan "Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
"
1 1 Stan "I do not!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
"
1 1 Stan "What? How do you know she has a cat? 
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa! 
"
1 1 Stan "Killer! Thanks, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
"
1 1 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
1 1 Stan "Kyle, look! It's them.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.
"
1 1 Stan "Owww.
"
1 1 Stan "Wow, poor Kenny.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
"
1 1 Stan "But her note said she'd be here. 
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
"
1 1 Stan "Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
"
1 1 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
1 1 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
1 1 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, it's happening again. 
"
1 1 Stan "Now, do you believe this, Cartman?
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 1 Stan "That was beautiful, dude.
"
1 1 Stan "No, they're leaving.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 
"
1 1 Stan "Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 1 Stan "Thanks for your help, Wendy.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, I didn't throw up.
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech! 
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 1 Stan "Cool.
"
1 1 Stan "I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
"
1 1 Stan "That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
"
1 1 Stan "I don't know what the hell that is...
"
1 1 Stan "Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
"
1 1 Stan "I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, hey Cartman.
"
1 1 Stan "Really, what about?
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, it was huge.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
"
1 2 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "What were you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
1 2 Stan "We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins are way smarter than you!
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
"
1 2 Stan "Tell me what you wrote about!
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
"
1 2 Stan "What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
"
1 2 Stan "What's that stuff?
"
1 2 Stan "Superfatass?
"
1 2 Stan "Take that you stupid Indian! 
"
1 2 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, look! 
"
1 2 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
1 2 Stan "Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
"
1 2 Stan "Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
"
1 2 Stan "Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
"
1 2 Stan "We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
"
1 3 Stan "You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
"
1 3 Stan "My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
"
1 3 Stan "Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
"
1 3 Stan "Is this hunting?
"
1 3 Stan "I can't. 
"
1 3 Stan "I don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I can shoot you, fat ass!
"
1 3 Stan "I'll kill you!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, Cartman's pee.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
"
1 3 Stan "Whatabutt?
"
1 3 Stan "Why?
"
1 3 Stan "A hook.
"
1 3 Stan "Celery?
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"
1 3 Stan "What, dude?
"
1 3 Stan "Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
"
1 3 Stan "With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
"
1 3 Stan "What? 
"
1 3 Stan "Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 3 Stan "Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
"
1 3 Stan "No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
"
1 3 Stan "I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
"
1 3 Stan "Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman?
"
1 3 Stan "Whoa, he built a wicker basket
"
1 3 Stan "I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, that was easy!
"
1 3 Stan "What?! Why?!
"
1 3 Stan "No.
"
1 3 Stan "But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
"
1 4 Stan "Hiya, Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
"
1 4 Stan "Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
"
1 4 Stan "He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
"
1 4 Stan "He's not meaner than Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky'll kick his ass.
"
1 4 Stan "That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky, bad dog!
"
1 4 Stan "What?!
"
1 4 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 4 Stan "He's just confused.
"
1 4 Stan "Sick, shut up dude. 
"
1 4 Stan "Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
"
1 4 Stan "Huh? 
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
"
1 4 Stan "Get down Sparky! Down!
"
1 4 Stan "Um, I'm not really prepared either.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, cool!
"
1 4 Stan "Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
"
1 4 Stan "What's a - homosexual?
"
1 4 Stan "I guess.
"
1 4 Stan "Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
"
1 4 Stan "He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on you guys, I have an idea.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
"
1 4 Stan "Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
"
1 4 Stan "I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
"
1 4 Stan "Like who?
"
1 4 Stan "Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
"
1 4 Stan "Damn it!
"
1 4 Stan "I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
"
1 4 Stan "Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
"
1 4 Stan "No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
"
1 4 Stan "I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
"
1 4 Stan "Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
"
1 4 Stan "I think he might've run away.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Sparky!
"
1 4 Stan "Fine, how are you?
"
1 4 Stan "My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
"
1 4 Stan "D'you have lots of gay dogs here?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
"
1 4 Stan "I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
"
1 4 Stan "What don't I understand?
"
1 4 Stan "This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
"
1 4 Stan "Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!
"
1 4 Stan "No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
"
1 4 Stan "I will Big Gay Al, I will. 
"
1 4 Stan "I've been getting my best friend back.
"
1 4 Stan "Hike!
"
1 4 Stan "Mph. 
"
1 4 Stan "Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
"
1 4 Stan "And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
"
1 4 Stan "And it's okay to be gay! 
"
1 4 Stan "Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
"
1 4 Stan "I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
"
1 4 Stan "But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
"
1 4 Stan "Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 5 Stan "Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
"
1 5 Stan "No!
"
1 5 Stan "She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
"
1 5 Stan "My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
"
1 5 Stan "Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 5 Stan "Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
"
1 5 Stan "Wow, that's cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
"
1 5 Stan "That'd be cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "Okay.
"
1 5 Stan "Yes…
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, neither.  It's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Hi Shelly.
"
1 5 Stan "Headgear?  What headgear?
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
"
1 5 Stan "Go where?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, quit being such a baby.
"
1 5 Stan "At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
"
1 5 Stan "Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
"
1 5 Stan "Ow!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah! Go away, Pip!
"
1 5 Stan "I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "So how do we do that?
"
1 5 Stan "Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
"
1 5 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 5 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
"
1 5 Stan "Sick dude, she's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Crap.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
"
1 5 Stan "Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
"
1 5 Stan "Sick!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
"
1 5 Stan "Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "A big mutant version of me?
"
1 5 Stan "I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
"
1 5 Stan "Oh my God!
"
1 5 Stan "Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
"
1 5 Stan "It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
"
1 5 Stan "Stop!
"
1 5 Stan "That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
"
1 5 Stan "Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
"
1 5 Stan "…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
"
1 5 Stan "No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
"
1 5 Stan "Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
"
1 5 Stan "You can't just leave me here alone.
"
1 5 Stan "Thanks a lot.
"
1 5 Stan "It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
"
1 5 Stan "Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
"
1 6 Stan "It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
"
1 6 Stan "Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
"
1 6 Stan "Aw, dammit!
"
1 6 Stan "Heheheh hehehe...
"
1 6 Stan "My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure.
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "Leave me alone grampa. 
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not going to kill you grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Good night grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
"
1 6 Stan "Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
"
1 6 Stan "My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
"
1 6 Stan "Really??
"
1 6 Stan "Wow!
"
1 6 Stan "So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
"
1 6 Stan "Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah...
"
1 6 Stan "Hey Chef.
"
1 6 Stan "Bad.
"
1 6 Stan "Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "No, I mean, kill my grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "See, I told you dude.
"
1 6 Stan "What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
"
1 6 Stan "Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
"
1 6 Stan "No grampa, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "No, I can't even kill a deer.
"
1 6 Stan "Grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
"
1 6 Stan "We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
"
1 6 Stan "Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, yeah!
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus?
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
"
1 6 Stan "Yes?
"
1 6 Stan "Goddammit!
"
1 6 Stan "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
1 6 Stan "Kyle, don't be such a butthole!
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
"
1 6 Stan "We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
"
1 6 Stan "Aaah!! 
"
1 6 Stan "We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
"
1 6 Stan "Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
"
1 6 Stan "Aww, do I have to?
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, what are you doing?! 
"
1 6 Stan "Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
"
1 6 Stan "Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
"
1 6 Stan "Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure I will grampa, I will.
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
"
1 6 Stan "'Kay, come on guys. 
"
1 6 Stan "You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
"
1 6 Stan "Are you ready grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
"
1 6 Stan "What is that?!
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, he's coming towards us.
"
1 6 Stan "Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah, but, mom!
"
1 6 Stan "Dad, Death is coming!
"
1 6 Stan "Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
"
1 6 Stan "Totally dude.
"
1 6 Stan "Quick, jump through the window.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey look!
"
1 6 Stan "Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on you guys, let's go home. 
"
1 6 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
"
1 6 Stan "Cool!
"
1 6 Stan "What are you doing grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "That's my silly grampa. 
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
"
1 7 Stan "Shut up Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "I'm Raggedy Andy.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
"
1 7 Stan "Where'd you get that?
"
1 7 Stan "No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!
"
1 7 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
"
1 7 Stan "Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
"
1 7 Stan "I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank.""
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
"
1 7 Stan "We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
"
1 7 Stan "You what?!
"
1 7 Stan "He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, where's Kyle?
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, me too.
"
1 7 Stan "Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
"
1 7 Stan "I bet I get more candy than you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
"
1 7 Stan "Plastic pumpkin pails...
"
1 7 Stan "Taser... 
"
1 7 Stan "For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
"
1 7 Stan "How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
"
1 7 Stan "Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
"
1 7 Stan "No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
"
1 7 Stan "What are you talking about Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God, that means...
"
1 7 Stan "Wait, where are we going?
"
1 7 Stan "I don't know about this Chef.
"
1 7 Stan "What are we doing here Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "What?
"
1 7 Stan "We told you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey Chef. Look.
"
1 7 Stan "Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 
"
1 7 Stan "Let's get out of here! 
"
1 7 Stan "We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
"
1 7 Stan "You call the number Kyle.
"
1 7 Stan "We'll hold 'em off.
"
1 7 Stan "Sweet! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "I know, but uh-... but...
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, yeah! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
"
1 7 Stan "I, I can't.
"
1 7 Stan "Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
"
1 7 Stan "That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
"
1 7 Stan "You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 7 Stan "Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
"
1 8 Stan "That was awesome!
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, who's that fat chick?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
"
1 8 Stan "SWEET!
"
1 8 Stan "I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
"
1 8 Stan "Just a second fat-ass!
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
"
1 8 Stan "You mean, like Kenny?
"
1 8 Stan "Damn.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
"
1 8 Stan "I think he said his name is Marvin.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
"
1 8 Stan "It was my mom's credit card.
"
1 8 Stan "This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
"
1 8 Stan "Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, yeah, we do!
"
1 8 Stan "He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
"
1 8 Stan "He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "No.
"
1 8 Stan "So why can't he live here now?
"
1 8 Stan "This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 
"
1 8 Stan "Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
"
1 8 Stan "We did it!! 
"
1 8 Stan "Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
"
1 8 Stan "You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
"
1 9 Stan "Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus

1 9 Stan "Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
"
1 9 Stan "Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Stan "Whoa, Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Stan "That was sick, dude!
"
1 9 Stan "...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
"
1 9 Stan "Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
"
1 9 Stan "We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Stan "Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "See you around, dude. 
"
1 9 Stan "The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
"
1 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 9 Stan "You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
"
1 9 Stan "'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
"
1 9 Stan "What's that?
"
1 9 Stan "What's in the box, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, sick!!! 
"
1 9 Stan "Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
"
1 9 Stan "Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
"
1 9 Stan "I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
"
1 9 Stan "This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
"
1 9 Stan "We committed him.
"
1 9 Stan "Huh?!  O-oh.
"
1 9 Stan "This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Stan "I believe. 
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 9 Stan "You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
"
1 9 Stan "Wh-what could it be? 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
"
1 10 Stan "Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
"
1 10 Stan "Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
"
1 10 Stan "Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
"
1 10 Stan "What the...&#160;?
"
1 10 Stan "A what?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus, Jesus!
"
1 10 Stan "Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
"
1 10 Stan "This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "You're gonna fight Satan?
"
1 10 Stan "I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
"
1 10 Stan "Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
"
1 10 Stan "Did the Devil show up yet?
"
1 10 Stan "Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
"
1 10 Stan "Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
"
1 10 Stan "Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
"
1 10 Stan "Bubye, Fartboy.
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
"
1 10 Stan "Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
"
1 10 Stan "But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, that was cool! 
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
"
1 10 Stan "Aaanh, he does this all the time.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
"
1 10 Stan "Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
"
1 10 Stan "She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
"
1 10 Stan "What?
"
1 10 Stan "... Really?
"
1 10 Stan "Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
"
1 10 Stan "You did, Jesus. 
"
1 10 Stan "Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
"
1 10 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
1 10 Stan "You're leaving already?
"
1 10 Stan "Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
"
1 11 Stan "I know.
"
1 11 Stan "I can't afford a cruise, dude.
"
1 11 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 11 Stan "You can say that again.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeu-bluuuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuch 
"
1 11 Stan "You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah, that one!
"
1 11 Stan "No.
"
1 11 Stan "Sure, Wendy, whatever.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch! I'd love to. 
"
1 11 Stan "That's not Kyle's...
"
1 11 Stan "We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
"
1 11 Stan "Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "See? She liked my present the best!
"
1 11 Stan "No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
"
1 11 Stan "I bet I scored 100!
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "That's impossible!
"
1 11 Stan "What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
"
1 11 Stan "A whatbian?
"
1 11 Stan "Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.
"
1 11 Stan "Oh.
"
1 11 Stan "Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
"
1 11 Stan "You're just saying that, Cartman.
"
1 11 Stan "What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
"
1 11 Stan "Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
"
1 11 Stan "I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
"
1 11 Stan "No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. Hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. Kick ass!
"
1 11 Stan "Are we making love now?
"
1 11 Stan "They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
"
1 11 Stan "You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
"
1 11 Stan "But why?
"
1 11 Stan "It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
"
1 11 Stan "I think so.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Did I what?
"
1 11 Stan "Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
"
1 11 Stan "Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuuch! 
"
1 11 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 12 Stan "Isn't that your job?
"
1 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
1 12 Stan "Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "What is it?
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 12 Stan "What are you going to do with it, dude?
"
1 12 Stan "You did throw it away, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "Well, you might as well let it go.
"
1 12 Stan "I have a button we can use for his nose.
"
1 12 Stan "Ow, that sucks, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "...so?
"
1 12 Stan "Like John Elway important?
"
1 12 Stan "D'you know John Elway?
"
1 12 Stan "Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
"
1 12 Stan "Why do you wanta know, lady?!
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "It's Saturday.
"
1 12 Stan "Man, the bus sure is late.
"
1 12 Stan "Fine.
"
1 12 Stan "Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, let us go!
"
1 12 Stan "Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 12 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 12 Stan "Get us down from here!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith? Sweet!
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1 12 Stan "My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
"
1 12 Stan "Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
"
1 12 Stan "Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
"
1 12 Stan "He did it!
"
1 12 Stan "Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
"
1 12 Stan "Good-bye, Robert Smith!
"
1 12 Stan "Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
"
1 12 Stan "Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
"
1 12 Stan "Go to hell, Cartman!
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God! Look! 
"
1 13 Stan "Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
"
1 13 Stan "Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
"
1 13 Stan "We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
"
1 13 Stan "I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
"
1 13 Stan "I always wondered if that would work.
"
1 13 Stan "In the backyard?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 13 Stan "No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
"
1 13 Stan "Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
"
1 13 Stan "No.
"
1 13 Stan "Is that legal?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
"
1 13 Stan "I donnow, just keep rolling.
"
1 13 Stan "Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
"
1 13 Stan "Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
"
1 13 Stan "Aaawww.
"
1 13 Stan "This guy sucks! 
"
1 13 Stan "Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
"
1 13 Stan "What?? 
"
1 13 Stan "What are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
1 13 Stan "Go ahead, dude. 
"
1 13 Stan "Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
"
1 13 Stan "Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
"
1 13 Stan "Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
"
1 13 Stan "Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
"
1 13 Stan "Cartman?!
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
"
1 13 Stan "Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.

1 13 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.

1 13 Stan "How 'bout some ice cream?

1 13 Stan "Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!

1 13 Stan "Dude. We lost.

1 13 Stan "Grampa!! 
"
1 13 Stan "Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
"
1 1 Stan "What's a dildo?
"
1 1 Stan "What's a dildo, Kenny?
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude! Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors are real.
"
1 1 Stan "What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
1 1 Stan "They took him on their ship.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, don't worry about him.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
"
1 1 Stan "I said I have a bad itch.
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors!
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"
1 1 Stan "Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Damn, Cartman!
"
1 1 Stan "It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
"
1 1 Stan "How can you eat when you're farting fire?
"
1 1 Stan "Where? 
"
1 1 Stan "Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
"
1 1 Stan "I do not!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
"
1 1 Stan "What? How do you know she has a cat? 
"
1 1 Stan "Uh, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!
"
1 1 Stan "Chef!!
"
1 1 Stan "Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa! 
"
1 1 Stan "Killer! Thanks, Chef.
"
1 1 Stan "Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
"
1 1 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
1 1 Stan "Kyle, look! It's them.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.
"
1 1 Stan "Owww.
"
1 1 Stan "Wow, poor Kenny.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
"
1 1 Stan "Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
"
1 1 Stan "But her note said she'd be here. 
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
"
1 1 Stan "Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
"
1 1 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
1 1 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
1 1 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, it's happening again. 
"
1 1 Stan "Now, do you believe this, Cartman?
"
1 1 Stan "Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
"
1 1 Stan "Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
"
1 1 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 1 Stan "That was beautiful, dude.
"
1 1 Stan "No, they're leaving.
"
1 1 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 1 Stan "Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 
"
1 1 Stan "Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 1 Stan "Thanks for your help, Wendy.
"
1 1 Stan "Hey, I didn't throw up.
"
1 1 Stan "Bleech! 
"
1 1 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 1 Stan "Cool.
"
1 1 Stan "I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
"
1 1 Stan "That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
"
1 1 Stan "I don't know what the hell that is...
"
1 1 Stan "Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
"
1 1 Stan "I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"
1 1 Stan "Oh, hey Cartman.
"
1 1 Stan "Really, what about?
"
1 1 Stan "That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, it was huge.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
"
1 2 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "What were you talking about?
"
1 2 Stan "That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
1 2 Stan "We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
"
1 2 Stan "Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins are way smarter than you!
"
1 2 Stan "Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
"
1 2 Stan "Tell me what you wrote about!
"
1 2 Stan "Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
"
1 2 Stan "What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
"
1 2 Stan "What's that stuff?
"
1 2 Stan "Superfatass?
"
1 2 Stan "Take that you stupid Indian! 
"
1 2 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
"
1 2 Stan "Wendy, look! 
"
1 2 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
1 2 Stan "Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
"
1 2 Stan "Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
"
1 2 Stan "Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
"
1 2 Stan "We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
"
1 3 Stan "You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
"
1 3 Stan "My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
"
1 3 Stan "Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
"
1 3 Stan "Is this hunting?
"
1 3 Stan "I can't. 
"
1 3 Stan "I don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
1 3 Stan "I can shoot you, fat ass!
"
1 3 Stan "I'll kill you!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah, Cartman's pee.
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
"
1 3 Stan "Whatabutt?
"
1 3 Stan "Why?
"
1 3 Stan "A hook.
"
1 3 Stan "Celery?
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
"
1 3 Stan "Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"
1 3 Stan "What, dude?
"
1 3 Stan "Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
"
1 3 Stan "With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
"
1 3 Stan "What? 
"
1 3 Stan "Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 3 Stan "Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
"
1 3 Stan "No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
"
1 3 Stan "I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
"
1 3 Stan "Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
"
1 3 Stan "Cartman?
"
1 3 Stan "Whoa, he built a wicker basket
"
1 3 Stan "I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
"
1 3 Stan "Hey, that was easy!
"
1 3 Stan "What?! Why?!
"
1 3 Stan "No.
"
1 3 Stan "But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
"
1 3 Stan "Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
"
1 4 Stan "Hiya, Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
"
1 4 Stan "Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
"
1 4 Stan "He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
"
1 4 Stan "He's not meaner than Sparky.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky'll kick his ass.
"
1 4 Stan "That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky, bad dog!
"
1 4 Stan "What?!
"
1 4 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 4 Stan "He's just confused.
"
1 4 Stan "Sick, shut up dude. 
"
1 4 Stan "Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
"
1 4 Stan "Huh? 
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
"
1 4 Stan "Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
"
1 4 Stan "Get down Sparky! Down!
"
1 4 Stan "Um, I'm not really prepared either.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, cool!
"
1 4 Stan "Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
"
1 4 Stan "What's a - homosexual?
"
1 4 Stan "I guess.
"
1 4 Stan "Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
"
1 4 Stan "He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on you guys, I have an idea.
"
1 4 Stan "Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
"
1 4 Stan "Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
"
1 4 Stan "I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
"
1 4 Stan "Like who?
"
1 4 Stan "Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
"
1 4 Stan "Damn it!
"
1 4 Stan "I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
"
1 4 Stan "Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
"
1 4 Stan "No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
"
1 4 Stan "I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
"
1 4 Stan "I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
"
1 4 Stan "Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
"
1 4 Stan "I think he might've run away.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing.
"
1 4 Stan "I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Sparky!
"
1 4 Stan "Fine, how are you?
"
1 4 Stan "My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
"
1 4 Stan "D'you have lots of gay dogs here?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
"
1 4 Stan "Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
"
1 4 Stan "I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
"
1 4 Stan "Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
"
1 4 Stan "What don't I understand?
"
1 4 Stan "This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
"
1 4 Stan "Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!
"
1 4 Stan "No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
"
1 4 Stan "I will Big Gay Al, I will. 
"
1 4 Stan "I've been getting my best friend back.
"
1 4 Stan "Hike!
"
1 4 Stan "Mph. 
"
1 4 Stan "Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
"
1 4 Stan "And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
"
1 4 Stan "And it's okay to be gay! 
"
1 4 Stan "Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
"
1 4 Stan "I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
"
1 4 Stan "But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
"
1 4 Stan "Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
"
1 4 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 5 Stan "Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
"
1 5 Stan "No!
"
1 5 Stan "She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
"
1 5 Stan "My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
"
1 5 Stan "Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 5 Stan "Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
"
1 5 Stan "Wow, that's cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
"
1 5 Stan "That'd be cool!
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "Okay.
"
1 5 Stan "Yes…
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, neither.  It's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Hi Shelly.
"
1 5 Stan "Headgear?  What headgear?
"
1 5 Stan "Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
"
1 5 Stan "Go where?
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, quit being such a baby.
"
1 5 Stan "At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
"
1 5 Stan "Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
"
1 5 Stan "Ow!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah! Go away, Pip!
"
1 5 Stan "I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "So how do we do that?
"
1 5 Stan "Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
"
1 5 Stan "Shut up Cartman!
"
1 5 Stan "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
"
1 5 Stan "Sick dude, she's my sister.
"
1 5 Stan "Crap.
"
1 5 Stan "No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that…that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
"
1 5 Stan "Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
"
1 5 Stan "Sick!
"
1 5 Stan "Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
"
1 5 Stan "Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
"
1 5 Stan "A big mutant version of me?
"
1 5 Stan "I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
"
1 5 Stan "Oh my God!
"
1 5 Stan "Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
"
1 5 Stan "It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
"
1 5 Stan "Stop!
"
1 5 Stan "That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
"
1 5 Stan "Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
"
1 5 Stan "…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
"
1 5 Stan "No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
"
1 5 Stan "Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
"
1 5 Stan "You can't just leave me here alone.
"
1 5 Stan "Thanks a lot.
"
1 5 Stan "It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
"
1 5 Stan "Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
"
1 5 Stan "Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
"
1 6 Stan "It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
"
1 6 Stan "Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
"
1 6 Stan "Aw, dammit!
"
1 6 Stan "Heheheh hehehe...
"
1 6 Stan "My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure.
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "Leave me alone grampa. 
"
1 6 Stan "I'm not going to kill you grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Good night grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
"
1 6 Stan "Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
"
1 6 Stan "My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
"
1 6 Stan "Really??
"
1 6 Stan "Wow!
"
1 6 Stan "So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
"
1 6 Stan "Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah...
"
1 6 Stan "Hey Chef.
"
1 6 Stan "Bad.
"
1 6 Stan "Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "No, I mean, kill my grampa.
"
1 6 Stan "See, I told you dude.
"
1 6 Stan "What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
"
1 6 Stan "Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
"
1 6 Stan "No grampa, I'll get in trouble.
"
1 6 Stan "No, I can't even kill a deer.
"
1 6 Stan "Grampa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
"
1 6 Stan "We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
"
1 6 Stan "Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, yeah!
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus?
"
1 6 Stan "Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
"
1 6 Stan "Yes?
"
1 6 Stan "Goddammit!
"
1 6 Stan "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
1 6 Stan "Kyle, don't be such a butthole!
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
"
1 6 Stan "We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
"
1 6 Stan "Aaah!! 
"
1 6 Stan "We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
"
1 6 Stan "Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
"
1 6 Stan "Aww, do I have to?
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, what are you doing?! 
"
1 6 Stan "Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.
"
1 6 Stan "Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
"
1 6 Stan "Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
"
1 6 Stan "Sure I will grampa, I will.
"
1 6 Stan "Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
"
1 6 Stan "'Kay, come on guys. 
"
1 6 Stan "You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
"
1 6 Stan "Are you ready grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
"
1 6 Stan "What is that?!
"
1 6 Stan "Hey, he's coming towards us.
"
1 6 Stan "Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
"
1 6 Stan "Yeah, but, mom!
"
1 6 Stan "Dad, Death is coming!
"
1 6 Stan "Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
"
1 6 Stan "Totally dude.
"
1 6 Stan "Quick, jump through the window.
"
1 6 Stan "Hey look!
"
1 6 Stan "Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
"
1 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 6 Stan "Come on you guys, let's go home. 
"
1 6 Stan "What do you mean?
"
1 6 Stan "I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
"
1 6 Stan "Cool!
"
1 6 Stan "What are you doing grampa?
"
1 6 Stan "That's my silly grampa. 
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
"
1 7 Stan "Shut up Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "I'm Raggedy Andy.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
"
1 7 Stan "Where'd you get that?
"
1 7 Stan "No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!
"
1 7 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
"
1 7 Stan "Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
"
1 7 Stan "Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
"
1 7 Stan "I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank.""
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
"
1 7 Stan "We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
"
1 7 Stan "You what?!
"
1 7 Stan "He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, where's Kyle?
"
1 7 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, me too.
"
1 7 Stan "Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
"
1 7 Stan "I bet I get more candy than you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
"
1 7 Stan "Plastic pumpkin pails...
"
1 7 Stan "Taser... 
"
1 7 Stan "For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
"
1 7 Stan "How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
"
1 7 Stan "I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
"
1 7 Stan "Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
"
1 7 Stan "No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, Kenny!
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
"
1 7 Stan "What are you talking about Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh my God, that means...
"
1 7 Stan "Wait, where are we going?
"
1 7 Stan "I don't know about this Chef.
"
1 7 Stan "What are we doing here Chef?
"
1 7 Stan "What?
"
1 7 Stan "We told you dude.
"
1 7 Stan "Hey Chef. Look.
"
1 7 Stan "Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 
"
1 7 Stan "Let's get out of here! 
"
1 7 Stan "We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
"
1 7 Stan "You call the number Kyle.
"
1 7 Stan "We'll hold 'em off.
"
1 7 Stan "Sweet! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy?
"
1 7 Stan "I know, but uh-... but...
"
1 7 Stan "Hey, yeah! 
"
1 7 Stan "Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
"
1 7 Stan "I, I can't.
"
1 7 Stan "Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
"
1 7 Stan "That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
"
1 7 Stan "Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
"
1 7 Stan "You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
"
1 7 Stan "Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
"
1 7 Stan "Oh.
"
1 7 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 7 Stan "Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
"
1 8 Stan "That was awesome!
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, who's that fat chick?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
"
1 8 Stan "SWEET!
"
1 8 Stan "I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
"
1 8 Stan "Just a second fat-ass!
"
1 8 Stan "Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?
"
1 8 Stan "Oh.
"
1 8 Stan "Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
"
1 8 Stan "You mean, like Kenny?
"
1 8 Stan "Damn.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
"
1 8 Stan "I think he said his name is Marvin.
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
"
1 8 Stan "It was my mom's credit card.
"
1 8 Stan "This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
"
1 8 Stan "Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
"
1 8 Stan "Yeah, yeah, we do!
"
1 8 Stan "He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
"
1 8 Stan "He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
"
1 8 Stan "No.
"
1 8 Stan "So why can't he live here now?
"
1 8 Stan "This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
"
1 8 Stan "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
1 8 Stan "Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 
"
1 8 Stan "Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
"
1 8 Stan "We did it!! 
"
1 8 Stan "Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
"
1 8 Stan "You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
"
1 9 Stan "Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
"
1 9 Stan "Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
"
1 9 Stan "Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Stan "Whoa, Christmas snow!
"
1 9 Stan "That was sick, dude!
"
1 9 Stan "...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
"
1 9 Stan "Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
"
1 9 Stan "We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 
"
1 9 Stan "Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "See you around, dude. 
"
1 9 Stan "The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
"
1 9 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 9 Stan "You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
"
1 9 Stan "'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
"
1 9 Stan "What's that?
"
1 9 Stan "What's in the box, dude?
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, sick!!! 
"
1 9 Stan "Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
"
1 9 Stan "Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
"
1 9 Stan "I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
"
1 9 Stan "This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
"
1 9 Stan "We committed him.
"
1 9 Stan "Huh?!  O-oh.
"
1 9 Stan "This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
"
1 9 Stan "I believe. 
"
1 9 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 9 Stan "You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
"
1 9 Stan "Wh-what could it be? 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
"
1 10 Stan "Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
"
1 10 Stan "Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
"
1 10 Stan "Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
"
1 10 Stan "Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
"
1 10 Stan "What the...&#160;?
"
1 10 Stan "A what?
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus, Jesus!
"
1 10 Stan "Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
"
1 10 Stan "This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "You're gonna fight Satan?
"
1 10 Stan "I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
"
1 10 Stan "Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
"
1 10 Stan "Did the Devil show up yet?
"
1 10 Stan "Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
"
1 10 Stan "Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
"
1 10 Stan "Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
"
1 10 Stan "Bubye, Fartboy.
"
1 10 Stan "Hey, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
"
1 10 Stan "Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
"
1 10 Stan "But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
"
1 10 Stan "Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, that was cool! 
"
1 10 Stan "Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
"
1 10 Stan "Aaanh, he does this all the time.
"
1 10 Stan "Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
"
1 10 Stan "Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
"
1 10 Stan "Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
"
1 10 Stan "She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
"
1 10 Stan "What?
"
1 10 Stan "... Really?
"
1 10 Stan "Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
"
1 10 Stan "You did, Jesus. 
"
1 10 Stan "Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
"
1 10 Stan "Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
"
1 10 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
1 10 Stan "You're leaving already?
"
1 10 Stan "Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
1 10 Stan "Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
"
1 11 Stan "I know.
"
1 11 Stan "I can't afford a cruise, dude.
"
1 11 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 11 Stan "You can say that again.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeu-bluuuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuch 
"
1 11 Stan "You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah, that one!
"
1 11 Stan "No.
"
1 11 Stan "Sure, Wendy, whatever.
"
1 11 Stan "Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch! I'd love to. 
"
1 11 Stan "That's not Kyle's...
"
1 11 Stan "We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
"
1 11 Stan "Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. 
"
1 11 Stan "See? She liked my present the best!
"
1 11 Stan "No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
"
1 11 Stan "I bet I scored 100!
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "That's impossible!
"
1 11 Stan "What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
"
1 11 Stan "A whatbian?
"
1 11 Stan "Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.
"
1 11 Stan "Oh.
"
1 11 Stan "Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
"
1 11 Stan "You're just saying that, Cartman.
"
1 11 Stan "What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
"
1 11 Stan "Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
"
1 11 Stan "I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
"
1 11 Stan "No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. Hi, Wendy.
"
1 11 Stan "Wow! 
"
1 11 Stan "Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuch. Kick ass!
"
1 11 Stan "Are we making love now?
"
1 11 Stan "They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
"
1 11 Stan "You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
"
1 11 Stan "But why?
"
1 11 Stan "It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
"
1 11 Stan "I think so.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Yup.
"
1 11 Stan "Did I what?
"
1 11 Stan "Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
"
1 11 Stan "Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
"
1 11 Stan "Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
"
1 11 Stan "Bluuuuch! 
"
1 11 Stan "Sorry.
"
1 12 Stan "Isn't that your job?
"
1 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
1 12 Stan "Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "What is it?
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa!
"
1 12 Stan "What are you going to do with it, dude?
"
1 12 Stan "You did throw it away, Cartman.
"
1 12 Stan "Well, you might as well let it go.
"
1 12 Stan "I have a button we can use for his nose.
"
1 12 Stan "Ow, that sucks, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "...so?
"
1 12 Stan "Like John Elway important?
"
1 12 Stan "D'you know John Elway?
"
1 12 Stan "Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
"
1 12 Stan "Why do you wanta know, lady?!
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude!
"
1 12 Stan "It's Saturday.
"
1 12 Stan "Man, the bus sure is late.
"
1 12 Stan "Fine.
"
1 12 Stan "Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah, let us go!
"
1 12 Stan "Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
"
1 12 Stan "Whoa, dude! 
"
1 12 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 12 Stan "Get us down from here!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith? Sweet!
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1 12 Stan "My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
"
1 12 Stan "Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
"
1 12 Stan "Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
"
1 12 Stan "Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
"
1 12 Stan "He did it!
"
1 12 Stan "Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
"
1 12 Stan "Good-bye, Robert Smith!
"
1 12 Stan "Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
"
1 12 Stan "Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
"
1 12 Stan "Go to hell, Cartman!
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
1 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
1 12 Stan "Oh my God! Look! 
"
1 13 Stan "Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
"
1 13 Stan "Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
"
1 13 Stan "We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
"
1 13 Stan "I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
"
1 13 Stan "I always wondered if that would work.
"
1 13 Stan "In the backyard?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1 13 Stan "No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
"
1 13 Stan "Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
"
1 13 Stan "No.
"
1 13 Stan "Is that legal?
"
1 13 Stan "Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
"
1 13 Stan "I donnow, just keep rolling.
"
1 13 Stan "Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
