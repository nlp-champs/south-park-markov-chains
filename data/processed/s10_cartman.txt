10 1 Cartman "I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
"
10 1 Cartman "Reverse to you, Jew. 
"
10 1 Cartman "All right! 
"
10 1 Cartman "Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
"
10 1 Cartman "Excuse me?
"
10 1 Cartman "...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
"
10 1 Cartman "Yeah!
"
10 1 Cartman "Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
"
10 1 Cartman "...Huh?
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
10 1 Cartman "No, Chef has always been super-cool.
"
10 1 Cartman "So what can we do??
"
10 1 Cartman "Come on, bitch! Dance!
"
10 1 Cartman "Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
"
10 1 Cartman "It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
"
10 1 Cartman "Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
"
10 1 Cartman "Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
"
10 1 Cartman "Run Chef!
"
10 1 Cartman "A mountain lion! 
"
10 1 Cartman "A grizzly bear!
"
10 1 Cartman "Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh never mind.
"
10 2 Cartman "Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Who? 
"
10 2 Cartman "Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
"
10 2 Cartman "You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
"
10 2 Cartman "Dude, what are you doing?
"
10 2 Cartman "THAT's gay, heh.
"
10 2 Cartman "Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
"
10 2 Cartman "Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
"
10 2 Cartman "You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
"
10 2 Cartman "No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
"
10 2 Cartman "Who?
"
10 2 Cartman "The smug?
"
10 2 Cartman "I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
"
10 2 Cartman "You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
"
10 2 Cartman "I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
"
10 2 Cartman "Butters, are you there?!
"
10 2 Cartman "I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
"
10 2 Cartman "Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
"
10 2 Cartman "Turning right at O two four niner. 
"
10 2 Cartman "Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
"
10 2 Cartman "Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
"
10 2 Cartman "Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
"
10 2 Cartman "We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
"
10 2 Cartman "We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
"
10 2 Cartman "Ah, that's better. 
"
10 3 Cartman "You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
"
10 3 Cartman "Yich. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yich.
"
10 3 Cartman "Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
"
10 3 Cartman "What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
"
10 3 Cartman "That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
"
10 3 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
"
10 3 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
"
10 3 Cartman "What?
"
10 3 Cartman "Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
"
10 3 Cartman "You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
"
10 3 Cartman "We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
"
10 3 Cartman "Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
"
10 3 Cartman "If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
"
10 3 Cartman "Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
"
10 3 Cartman "All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
"
10 3 Cartman "You know we might not even make it into the studio.
"
10 3 Cartman "So what made you change your mind?
"
10 3 Cartman "Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
"
10 3 Cartman "Are you set?
"
10 3 Cartman "All right, let's roll! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
"
10 3 Cartman "It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
10 3 Cartman "Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
"
10 3 Cartman "Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
"
10 3 Cartman "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
"
10 3 Cartman "Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
"
10 3 Cartman "Kyle, stop it!
"
10 3 Cartman "Holy Crap! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
"
10 3 Cartman "Suck mah balls, Kyle! 
"
10 3 Cartman "This... explains everything.
"
10 3 Cartman "Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
"
10 4 Cartman "Kyle, stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "So long, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
"
10 4 Cartman "It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
"
10 4 Cartman "Dude, can I go before you?
"
10 4 Cartman "So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
"
10 4 Cartman "So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
"
10 4 Cartman "Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
"
10 4 Cartman "...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
"
10 4 Cartman "This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
"
10 4 Cartman "Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
"
10 4 Cartman "Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
"
10 4 Cartman "Seeya.
"
10 4 Cartman "Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
"
10 4 Cartman "You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
"
10 4 Cartman "I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
"
10 4 Cartman "I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. 
"
10 4 Cartman "It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
"
10 4 Cartman "Wha?  What are they?
"
10 4 Cartman "Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
"
10 4 Cartman "Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
"
10 4 Cartman "Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
"
10 4 Cartman "Why not?
"
10 4 Cartman "Son of a bitch.
"
10 4 Cartman "Well well well! 
"
10 4 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
"
10 4 Cartman "You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
"
10 4 Cartman "Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
"
10 4 Cartman "Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
"
10 4 Cartman "Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
"
10 4 Cartman "I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
"
10 4 Cartman "Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
"
10 4 Cartman "How the hell did you get out?
"
10 4 Cartman "Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
"
10 4 Cartman "You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
"
10 4 Cartman "I can't let you do that!
"
10 4 Cartman "Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 
"
10 4 Cartman "Stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
"
10 4 Cartman "Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
"
10 4 Cartman "Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
"
10 4 Cartman "Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
"
10 4 Cartman "No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
"
10 4 Cartman "Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
"
10 4 Cartman "Shut up, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
"
10 4 Cartman "No gay speeches, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
"
10 6 Cartman "Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
"
10 6 Cartman "All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Dude, what are you doing?
"
10 6 Cartman "No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
"
10 6 Cartman "Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
"
10 6 Cartman "Ah I don't think so, dude. 
"
10 6 Cartman "You... have that kind of power?
"
10 6 Cartman "Somebody get us some help down hyah!
"
10 6 Cartman "Hello??
"
10 6 Cartman "You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
"
10 6 Cartman "You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
"
10 6 Cartman "This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
"
10 6 Cartman "No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
"
10 6 Cartman "I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
"
10 6 Cartman "You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
"
10 6 Cartman "I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
"
10 6 Cartman "No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
"
10 6 Cartman "That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
"
10 6 Cartman "I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
"
10 6 Cartman "All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
"
10 6 Cartman "Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
"
10 6 Cartman "Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
"
10 6 Cartman "All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.
"
10 6 Cartman "I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
"
10 6 Cartman "NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
"
10 6 Cartman "You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Yes you do! 
"
10 6 Cartman "No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
"
10 6 Cartman "Grab my hand.
"
10 6 Cartman "I can't kick!
"
10 6 Cartman "I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
"
10 6 Cartman "No, you just have to save me. 
"
10 6 Cartman "No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
"
10 6 Cartman "Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
"
10 6 Cartman "It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
"
10 6 Cartman "That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
"
10 6 Cartman "Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
"
10 6 Cartman "Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
"
10 6 Cartman "Eh! 
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
"
10 7 Cartman "Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well he called me chubby!
"
10 7 Cartman "Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
"
10 7 Cartman "Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I need another energy drink! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
"
10 7 Cartman "Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I want a Twinkie.
"
10 7 Cartman "Ha! Hahahahahaha
"
10 7 Cartman "No thanks, I'd rather naught.
"
10 7 Cartman "The hell do you think you're doing?
"
10 7 Cartman "Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
"
10 7 Cartman "Time out?
"
10 7 Cartman "And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
"
10 7 Cartman "Whoa, how did I do that? 
"
10 7 Cartman "Ummm, no?
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
"
10 7 Cartman "Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
"
10 7 Cartman "Because you took my Xbox.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, yeah.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah. I guess so.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
"
10 7 Cartman "Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
"
10 7 Cartman "Why not?
"
10 7 Cartman "You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
"
10 7 Cartman "You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
"
10 7 Cartman "Not interested I'm me?
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah, well I don't see why-
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, this guy doesn't-
"
10 7 Cartman "Ah! Quit it!
"
10 7 Cartman "Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
"
10 7 Cartman "KNOCK IT OFF!
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm not fat!
"
10 7 Cartman "Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, this is degrading!
"
10 7 Cartman "Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "God dammit stop ignoring me!
"
10 7 Cartman "This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
"
10 7 Cartman "Quit it, mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "Ooo, Colonel?
"
10 7 Cartman "Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
"
10 7 Cartman "Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
"
10 7 Cartman "Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
"
10 7 Cartman "Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
"
10 7 Cartman "You can't do that to me, I-
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddamnit, you just can't-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriously! Ey? Eh... 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
"
10 7 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
"
10 7 Cartman "Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
"
10 7 Cartman "You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
"
10 7 Cartman "...Should that really matter at a time like this?
"
10 7 Cartman "This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, I'm back.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
"
10 7 Cartman "That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
"
10 7 Cartman "Aw, Goddammit!
"
10 7 Cartman "What is he still doing here?!
"
10 7 Cartman "What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
"
10 7 Cartman "Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
"
10 7 Cartman "I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
"
10 7 Cartman "Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriously! Mom-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom?!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom? Mom...
"
10 7 Cartman "Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
"
10 7 Cartman "Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
"
10 7 Cartman "She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
"
10 7 Cartman "She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
"
10 7 Cartman "Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
"
10 7 Cartman "Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
"
10 7 Cartman "You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 
"
10 7 Cartman "No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
"
10 7 Cartman "She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
"
10 7 Cartman "Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
"
10 7 Cartman "Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
"
10 7 Cartman "Tha... thank you?
"
10 7 Cartman "'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
"
10 7 Cartman "I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
"
10 7 Cartman "No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
"
10 7 Cartman "Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
"
10 8 Cartman "Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, I'm back.
"
10 8 Cartman "Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
"
10 8 Cartman "Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
"
10 8 Cartman "Heheh, totally, heheh.
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
"
10 8 Cartman "Get out of here, asshole!
"
10 8 Cartman "Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
"
10 8 Cartman "That sonofabitch!
"
10 8 Cartman "He's a God damned butthole!
"
10 8 Cartman "My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
"
10 8 Cartman "We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
"
10 8 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
"
10 8 Cartman "When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
"
10 8 Cartman "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
"
10 8 Cartman "The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
"
10 8 Cartman "This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
10 8 Cartman "You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
"
10 8 Cartman "So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
"
10 8 Cartman "Then let's move out! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone hold! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
"
10 8 Cartman "Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
"
10 8 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
"
10 8 Cartman "Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
"
10 8 Cartman "I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
"
10 8 Cartman "That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
"
10 8 Cartman "There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
"
10 8 Cartman "Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
"
10 8 Cartman "Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
"
10 8 Cartman "Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
"
10 8 Cartman "Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
"
10 8 Cartman "Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?
"
10 8 Cartman "More Hot Pockets!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, everyone ready?
"
10 8 Cartman "Let's go get him! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
"
10 8 Cartman "Command-0. 
"
10 8 Cartman "Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
"
10 8 Cartman "Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
"
10 8 Cartman "Christ...
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone target scorpions.
"
10 8 Cartman "Kyle! Fire spell!
"
10 8 Cartman "Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 
"
10 8 Cartman "I'm going as fast as I can!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
"
10 8 Cartman "It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
"
10 8 Cartman "Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
"
10 8 Cartman "Kyle, cast arcane missile!
"
10 8 Cartman "Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 
"
10 8 Cartman "His shield and armor spells are down!
"
10 8 Cartman "Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Yes!
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, yay.
"
10 8 Cartman "We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
"
10 8 Cartman "What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
"
10 9 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
"
10 9 Cartman "Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
"
10 9 Cartman "They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
"
10 9 Cartman "Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
"
10 9 Cartman "Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
"
10 9 Cartman "...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
"
10 9 Cartman "Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
"
10 9 Cartman "Aha! Do you see?
"
10 9 Cartman "I rest my case.
"
10 9 Cartman "That's right, Butters.
"
10 9 Cartman "What? People see the truth?
"
10 9 Cartman "You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
"
10 9 Cartman "It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
"
10 9 Cartman "Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
"
10 9 Cartman "For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
"
10 9 Cartman "We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
"
10 9 Cartman "So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
"
10 9 Cartman "Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
"
10 10 Cartman "And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
"
10 10 Cartman "What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
"
10 10 Cartman "Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
"
10 10 Cartman "Aw Goddamnit!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
"
10 10 Cartman "The hall monit- me?
"
10 10 Cartman "Auth- authoritah?
"
10 10 Cartman "Ahem. Me?
"
10 10 Cartman "There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
"
10 10 Cartman "That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
"
10 10 Cartman "You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
"
10 10 Cartman "All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Argh!
"
10 10 Cartman "I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Hands?! Let me see those hands!
"
10 10 Cartman "Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
"
10 10 Cartman "I knew it! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
"
10 10 Cartman "Here, you need a smoke, brah?
"
10 10 Cartman "You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
"
10 10 Cartman "Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
"
10 10 Cartman "Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
"
10 10 Cartman "What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"
10 10 Cartman "Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
"
10 10 Cartman "They what??
"
10 10 Cartman "Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
"
10 10 Cartman "Hall infraction! 
"
10 10 Cartman "You got a hall pass, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Get down on the floor!
"
10 10 Cartman "You like bear mace, icehead?!
"
10 10 Cartman "You're goin' with Christ! 
"
10 10 Cartman "...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
"
10 10 Cartman "Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
"
10 10 Cartman "I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
"
10 10 Cartman "You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
"
10 10 Cartman "You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Oh no!
"
10 10 Cartman "I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
"
10 10 Cartman "There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
"
10 10 Cartman "I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
"
10 10 Cartman "Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
"
10 10 Cartman "It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
"
10 10 Cartman "You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
"
10 10 Cartman "I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
"
10 10 Cartman "Praise Christ! Let's go! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Freeze, bitch!
"
10 10 Cartman "It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
"
10 10 Cartman "Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
"
10 10 Cartman "Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
"
10 10 Cartman "That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
"
10 11 Cartman "What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
"
10 11 Cartman "See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
"
10 11 Cartman "I've done it lots of times.
"
10 11 Cartman "Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
"
10 11 Cartman "I am not!
"
10 11 Cartman "Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 
"
10 11 Cartman "Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
"
10 11 Cartman "Dude...
"
10 11 Cartman "You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
"
10 11 Cartman "How do you know??
"
10 11 Cartman "How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
"
10 12 Cartman "Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
"
10 12 Cartman "I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
10 12 Cartman "Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
"
10 12 Cartman "No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
"
10 12 Cartman "Noo!! Nooo!!
"
10 12 Cartman "How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
"
10 12 Cartman "Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
"
10 12 Cartman "HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
"
10 12 Cartman "Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
"
10 12 Cartman "Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
"
10 12 Cartman "Oh God!
"
10 12 Cartman "Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
"
10 12 Cartman "You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
"
10 12 Cartman "I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
"
10 12 Cartman "No. There is something I can do.
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
"
10 12 Cartman "Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
"
10 12 Cartman "It's simple science, Kyle.
"
10 12 Cartman "I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
"
10 12 Cartman "I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
"
10 12 Cartman "Ey!
"
10 12 Cartman "Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
"
10 12 Cartman "No! No, it's too soon!
"
10 12 Cartman "Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
"
10 12 Cartman "You're gonna help me freeze myself.
"
10 12 Cartman "Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
"
10 12 Cartman "No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
"
10 12 Cartman "Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
"
10 12 Cartman "Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
"
10 12 Cartman "Where am I?
"
10 12 Cartman "Safe where, butthole?!
"
10 12 Cartman "What??
"
10 12 Cartman "Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
"
10 12 Cartman "Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
"
10 12 Cartman "I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
"
10 12 Cartman "No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
"
10 12 Cartman "This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
"
10 12 Cartman "What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!
"
10 12 Cartman "So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
"
10 12 Cartman "I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
"
10 12 Cartman "And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
"
10 12 Cartman "Who? 
"
10 12 Cartman "Who are they??
"
10 12 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
10 12 Cartman "I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
"
10 12 Cartman "What??
"
10 13 Cartman "Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
"
10 13 Cartman "We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
"
10 13 Cartman "Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 
"
10 13 Cartman "I got it! I got the Wii!
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
"
10 13 Cartman "Here. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
"
10 13 Cartman "There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
"
10 13 Cartman "You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
"
10 13 Cartman "I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
"
10 13 Cartman "Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
"
10 13 Cartman "God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Tell me about it.
"
10 13 Cartman "What?
"
10 13 Cartman "Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
"
10 13 Cartman "I care! Where's the closest toy store??
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on! Come on!
"
10 13 Cartman "Ugh, finally!
"
10 13 Cartman "I want one of those time-phone things.
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
"
10 13 Cartman "Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Look, I have to have one of those phones!
"
10 13 Cartman "How about a robot? How much for the robot?
"
10 13 Cartman "Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
"
10 13 Cartman "I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
"
10 13 Cartman "Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
"
10 13 Cartman "Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh God!  Hello? 
"
10 13 Cartman "Who is this?
"
10 13 Cartman "What?? Who the hell is this?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Me who?!
"
10 13 Cartman "What?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh very funny, Kyle!
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
"
10 13 Cartman "Listen to this!  Dickhead. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
"
10 13 Cartman "What??  Who the fuck is this?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Suck my balls!
"
10 13 Cartman "...Okay, you have one minute.
"
10 13 Cartman "Are you spying on me?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
"
10 13 Cartman "This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
"
10 13 Cartman "What is the Great Question?
"
10 13 Cartman "I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Who?
"
10 13 Cartman "Garrison? But he's an asshole.
"
10 13 Cartman "It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
"
10 13 Cartman "I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
"
10 13 Cartman "Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
"
10 13 Cartman "Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Go... Right... Where am I going? 
"
10 13 Cartman "Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
"
10 13 Cartman "So there is no war now in the future.
"
10 13 Cartman "And what was that purpose again?
"
10 13 Cartman "Right... 
"
10 13 Cartman "I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
"
10 13 Cartman "Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
"
10 13 Cartman "Mom! Mom, they did it!
"
10 13 Cartman "No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
10 13 Cartman "What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
"
10 13 Cartman "I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
"
10 13 Cartman "Hello?
"
10 13 Cartman "...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 
"
10 1 Cartman "I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
"
10 1 Cartman "Reverse to you, Jew. 
"
10 1 Cartman "All right! 
"
10 1 Cartman "Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
"
10 1 Cartman "Excuse me?
"
10 1 Cartman "...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
"
10 1 Cartman "Yeah!
"
10 1 Cartman "Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
"
10 1 Cartman "...Huh?
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh, son of a bitch!
"
10 1 Cartman "No, Chef has always been super-cool.
"
10 1 Cartman "So what can we do??
"
10 1 Cartman "Come on, bitch! Dance!
"
10 1 Cartman "Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
"
10 1 Cartman "It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
"
10 1 Cartman "Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
"
10 1 Cartman "Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
"
10 1 Cartman "Run Chef!
"
10 1 Cartman "A mountain lion! 
"
10 1 Cartman "A grizzly bear!
"
10 1 Cartman "Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
"
10 1 Cartman "Oh never mind.
"
10 2 Cartman "Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Who? 
"
10 2 Cartman "Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
"
10 2 Cartman "You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
"
10 2 Cartman "Dude, what are you doing?
"
10 2 Cartman "THAT's gay, heh.
"
10 2 Cartman "Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
"
10 2 Cartman "Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
"
10 2 Cartman "You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
"
10 2 Cartman "No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
"
10 2 Cartman "Who?
"
10 2 Cartman "The smug?
"
10 2 Cartman "I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
"
10 2 Cartman "You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
"
10 2 Cartman "I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
"
10 2 Cartman "Butters, are you there?!
"
10 2 Cartman "I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
"
10 2 Cartman "Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
"
10 2 Cartman "Turning right at O two four niner. 
"
10 2 Cartman "Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
"
10 2 Cartman "Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
"
10 2 Cartman "Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
"
10 2 Cartman "We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
"
10 2 Cartman "Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
"
10 2 Cartman "We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
"
10 2 Cartman "Ah, that's better. 
"
10 3 Cartman "You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
"
10 3 Cartman "Yich. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yich.
"
10 3 Cartman "Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
"
10 3 Cartman "What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
"
10 3 Cartman "That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
"
10 3 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
"
10 3 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
"
10 3 Cartman "What?
"
10 3 Cartman "Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
"
10 3 Cartman "You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
"
10 3 Cartman "We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
"
10 3 Cartman "Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
"
10 3 Cartman "If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
"
10 3 Cartman "Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
"
10 3 Cartman "All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
"
10 3 Cartman "You know we might not even make it into the studio.
"
10 3 Cartman "So what made you change your mind?
"
10 3 Cartman "Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
"
10 3 Cartman "Are you set?
"
10 3 Cartman "All right, let's roll! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
"
10 3 Cartman "It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
10 3 Cartman "Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
"
10 3 Cartman "Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
"
10 3 Cartman "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
"
10 3 Cartman "Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
"
10 3 Cartman "Kyle, stop it!
"
10 3 Cartman "Holy Crap! 
"
10 3 Cartman "Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
"
10 3 Cartman "Suck mah balls, Kyle! 
"
10 3 Cartman "This... explains everything.
"
10 3 Cartman "Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
"
10 4 Cartman "Kyle, stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "So long, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
"
10 4 Cartman "It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
"
10 4 Cartman "Dude, can I go before you?
"
10 4 Cartman "So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
"
10 4 Cartman "So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
"
10 4 Cartman "Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
"
10 4 Cartman "...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
"
10 4 Cartman "This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
"
10 4 Cartman "Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
"
10 4 Cartman "Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
"
10 4 Cartman "Seeya.
"
10 4 Cartman "Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
"
10 4 Cartman "You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
"
10 4 Cartman "I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
"
10 4 Cartman "I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. 
"
10 4 Cartman "It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
"
10 4 Cartman "Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
"
10 4 Cartman "Wha?  What are they?
"
10 4 Cartman "Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
"
10 4 Cartman "Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
"
10 4 Cartman "Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
"
10 4 Cartman "Why not?
"
10 4 Cartman "Son of a bitch.
"
10 4 Cartman "Well well well! 
"
10 4 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
"
10 4 Cartman "You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
"
10 4 Cartman "Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
"
10 4 Cartman "Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
"
10 4 Cartman "Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
"
10 4 Cartman "I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
"
10 4 Cartman "Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
"
10 4 Cartman "How the hell did you get out?
"
10 4 Cartman "Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
"
10 4 Cartman "You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
"
10 4 Cartman "I can't let you do that!
"
10 4 Cartman "Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 
"
10 4 Cartman "Stop it!
"
10 4 Cartman "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
"
10 4 Cartman "Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
"
10 4 Cartman "Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
"
10 4 Cartman "Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
"
10 4 Cartman "No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
"
10 4 Cartman "Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
"
10 4 Cartman "Shut up, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
"
10 4 Cartman "No gay speeches, Kyle!
"
10 4 Cartman "No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
"
10 6 Cartman "Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
"
10 6 Cartman "All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Dude, what are you doing?
"
10 6 Cartman "No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
"
10 6 Cartman "Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
"
10 6 Cartman "Ah I don't think so, dude. 
"
10 6 Cartman "You... have that kind of power?
"
10 6 Cartman "Somebody get us some help down hyah!
"
10 6 Cartman "Hello??
"
10 6 Cartman "You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
"
10 6 Cartman "You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
"
10 6 Cartman "This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
"
10 6 Cartman "No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
"
10 6 Cartman "I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
"
10 6 Cartman "You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
"
10 6 Cartman "I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
"
10 6 Cartman "No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
"
10 6 Cartman "That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
"
10 6 Cartman "I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
"
10 6 Cartman "All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
"
10 6 Cartman "Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
"
10 6 Cartman "Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
"
10 6 Cartman "All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.
"
10 6 Cartman "I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
"
10 6 Cartman "NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
"
10 6 Cartman "Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
"
10 6 Cartman "You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
"
10 6 Cartman "Yes you do! 
"
10 6 Cartman "No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
"
10 6 Cartman "Grab my hand.
"
10 6 Cartman "I can't kick!
"
10 6 Cartman "I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
"
10 6 Cartman "No, you just have to save me. 
"
10 6 Cartman "No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
"
10 6 Cartman "Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
"
10 6 Cartman "It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
"
10 6 Cartman "That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
"
10 6 Cartman "Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
"
10 6 Cartman "Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
"
10 6 Cartman "Eh! 
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
"
10 7 Cartman "Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well he called me chubby!
"
10 7 Cartman "Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
"
10 7 Cartman "Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I need another energy drink! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
"
10 7 Cartman "Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I want a Twinkie.
"
10 7 Cartman "Ha! Hahahahahaha
"
10 7 Cartman "No thanks, I'd rather naught.
"
10 7 Cartman "The hell do you think you're doing?
"
10 7 Cartman "Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
"
10 7 Cartman "Time out?
"
10 7 Cartman "And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
"
10 7 Cartman "Whoa, how did I do that? 
"
10 7 Cartman "Ummm, no?
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
"
10 7 Cartman "Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
"
10 7 Cartman "Because you took my Xbox.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, yeah.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah. I guess so.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
"
10 7 Cartman "Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
"
10 7 Cartman "Why not?
"
10 7 Cartman "You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
"
10 7 Cartman "You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
"
10 7 Cartman "Not interested I'm me?
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah, well I don't see why-
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, this guy doesn't-
"
10 7 Cartman "Ah! Quit it!
"
10 7 Cartman "Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
"
10 7 Cartman "KNOCK IT OFF!
"
10 7 Cartman "I'm not fat!
"
10 7 Cartman "Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, this is degrading!
"
10 7 Cartman "Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "God dammit stop ignoring me!
"
10 7 Cartman "This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
"
10 7 Cartman "Quit it, mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "Ooo, Colonel?
"
10 7 Cartman "Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
"
10 7 Cartman "Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
"
10 7 Cartman "Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
"
10 7 Cartman "Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
"
10 7 Cartman "You can't do that to me, I-
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddamnit, you just can't-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriously! Ey? Eh... 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
"
10 7 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
"
10 7 Cartman "Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
"
10 7 Cartman "You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
"
10 7 Cartman "Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
"
10 7 Cartman "...Should that really matter at a time like this?
"
10 7 Cartman "This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
"
10 7 Cartman "All right, I'm back.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
"
10 7 Cartman "That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
"
10 7 Cartman "Aw, Goddammit!
"
10 7 Cartman "What is he still doing here?!
"
10 7 Cartman "What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
"
10 7 Cartman "Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
"
10 7 Cartman "I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
"
10 7 Cartman "Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriously! Mom-
"
10 7 Cartman "Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom?!
"
10 7 Cartman "Mom? Mom...
"
10 7 Cartman "Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
"
10 7 Cartman "Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
"
10 7 Cartman "She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
"
10 7 Cartman "Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
"
10 7 Cartman "She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
"
10 7 Cartman "Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
"
10 7 Cartman "Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
"
10 7 Cartman "You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 
"
10 7 Cartman "No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
"
10 7 Cartman "She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
"
10 7 Cartman "Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
"
10 7 Cartman "Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 
"
10 7 Cartman "Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
"
10 7 Cartman "Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
"
10 7 Cartman "Tha... thank you?
"
10 7 Cartman "'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
"
10 7 Cartman "I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
"
10 7 Cartman "No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
"
10 7 Cartman "Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
"
10 8 Cartman "Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, I'm back.
"
10 8 Cartman "Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
"
10 8 Cartman "Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
"
10 8 Cartman "Heheh, totally, heheh.
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
"
10 8 Cartman "Get out of here, asshole!
"
10 8 Cartman "Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
"
10 8 Cartman "That sonofabitch!
"
10 8 Cartman "He's a God damned butthole!
"
10 8 Cartman "My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
"
10 8 Cartman "We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
"
10 8 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
"
10 8 Cartman "When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
"
10 8 Cartman "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
"
10 8 Cartman "The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
"
10 8 Cartman "This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
"
10 8 Cartman "Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
10 8 Cartman "You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
"
10 8 Cartman "So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
"
10 8 Cartman "Then let's move out! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone hold! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
"
10 8 Cartman "Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
"
10 8 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
"
10 8 Cartman "Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
"
10 8 Cartman "I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
"
10 8 Cartman "That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
"
10 8 Cartman "There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
"
10 8 Cartman "Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
"
10 8 Cartman "Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
"
10 8 Cartman "Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
"
10 8 Cartman "Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
"
10 8 Cartman "Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?
"
10 8 Cartman "More Hot Pockets!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, everyone ready?
"
10 8 Cartman "Let's go get him! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
"
10 8 Cartman "Command-0. 
"
10 8 Cartman "Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
"
10 8 Cartman "Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
"
10 8 Cartman "Christ...
"
10 8 Cartman "Everyone target scorpions.
"
10 8 Cartman "Kyle! Fire spell!
"
10 8 Cartman "Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 
"
10 8 Cartman "I'm going as fast as I can!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
"
10 8 Cartman "It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
"
10 8 Cartman "Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
"
10 8 Cartman "Kyle, cast arcane missile!
"
10 8 Cartman "Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 
"
10 8 Cartman "His shield and armor spells are down!
"
10 8 Cartman "Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 
"
10 8 Cartman "Yes!
"
10 8 Cartman "Yeah!
"
10 8 Cartman "All right, yay.
"
10 8 Cartman "We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
"
10 8 Cartman "What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
"
10 8 Cartman "Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
"
10 9 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
"
10 9 Cartman "Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
"
10 9 Cartman "They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
"
10 9 Cartman "Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
"
10 9 Cartman "Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
"
10 9 Cartman "...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
"
10 9 Cartman "Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
"
10 9 Cartman "Aha! Do you see?
"
10 9 Cartman "I rest my case.
"
10 9 Cartman "That's right, Butters.
"
10 9 Cartman "What? People see the truth?
"
10 9 Cartman "You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
"
10 9 Cartman "It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
"
10 9 Cartman "Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
"
10 9 Cartman "For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
"
10 9 Cartman "We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
"
10 9 Cartman "So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
"
10 9 Cartman "Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
"
10 10 Cartman "And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
"
10 10 Cartman "What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
"
10 10 Cartman "Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
"
10 10 Cartman "Aw Goddamnit!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
"
10 10 Cartman "The hall monit- me?
"
10 10 Cartman "Auth- authoritah?
"
10 10 Cartman "Ahem. Me?
"
10 10 Cartman "There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
"
10 10 Cartman "That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
"
10 10 Cartman "You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
"
10 10 Cartman "All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Argh!
"
10 10 Cartman "I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Hands?! Let me see those hands!
"
10 10 Cartman "Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
"
10 10 Cartman "I knew it! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
"
10 10 Cartman "Here, you need a smoke, brah?
"
10 10 Cartman "You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
"
10 10 Cartman "Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
"
10 10 Cartman "Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
"
10 10 Cartman "What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"
10 10 Cartman "Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
"
10 10 Cartman "They what??
"
10 10 Cartman "Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
"
10 10 Cartman "Hall infraction! 
"
10 10 Cartman "You got a hall pass, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Get down on the floor!
"
10 10 Cartman "You like bear mace, icehead?!
"
10 10 Cartman "You're goin' with Christ! 
"
10 10 Cartman "...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
"
10 10 Cartman "Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
"
10 10 Cartman "I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
"
10 10 Cartman "You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
"
10 10 Cartman "You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
"
10 10 Cartman "Oh no!
"
10 10 Cartman "I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
"
10 10 Cartman "There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
"
10 10 Cartman "I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
"
10 10 Cartman "I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
"
10 10 Cartman "Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
"
10 10 Cartman "It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
"
10 10 Cartman "You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
"
10 10 Cartman "I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
"
10 10 Cartman "Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
"
10 10 Cartman "I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
"
10 10 Cartman "Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
"
10 10 Cartman "Praise Christ! Let's go! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 
"
10 10 Cartman "Freeze, bitch!
"
10 10 Cartman "It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
"
10 10 Cartman "Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
"
10 10 Cartman "Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
"
10 10 Cartman "That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
"
10 11 Cartman "What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
"
10 11 Cartman "See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
"
10 11 Cartman "I've done it lots of times.
"
10 11 Cartman "Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
"
10 11 Cartman "I am not!
"
10 11 Cartman "Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 
"
10 11 Cartman "Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
"
10 11 Cartman "Dude...
"
10 11 Cartman "You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
"
10 11 Cartman "How do you know??
"
10 11 Cartman "How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
"
10 12 Cartman "Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
"
10 12 Cartman "I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
10 12 Cartman "Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
"
10 12 Cartman "No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
"
10 12 Cartman "Noo!! Nooo!!
"
10 12 Cartman "How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
"
10 12 Cartman "Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
"
10 12 Cartman "HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
"
10 12 Cartman "Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
"
10 12 Cartman "Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
"
10 12 Cartman "Oh God!
"
10 12 Cartman "Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
"
10 12 Cartman "You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
"
10 12 Cartman "I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
"
10 12 Cartman "No. There is something I can do.
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
"
10 12 Cartman "Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
"
10 12 Cartman "It's simple science, Kyle.
"
10 12 Cartman "I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
"
10 12 Cartman "I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
"
10 12 Cartman "Ey!
"
10 12 Cartman "Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
"
10 12 Cartman "No! No, it's too soon!
"
10 12 Cartman "Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
"
10 12 Cartman "You're gonna help me freeze myself.
"
10 12 Cartman "Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
"
10 12 Cartman "No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
"
10 12 Cartman "All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
"
10 12 Cartman "Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
"
10 12 Cartman "Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
"
10 12 Cartman "Where am I?
"
10 12 Cartman "Safe where, butthole?!
"
10 12 Cartman "What??
"
10 12 Cartman "Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
"
10 12 Cartman "Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
"
10 12 Cartman "I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
"
10 12 Cartman "No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
"
10 12 Cartman "This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
"
10 12 Cartman "What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!
"
10 12 Cartman "So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
"
10 12 Cartman "I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
"
10 12 Cartman "And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
"
10 12 Cartman "Who? 
"
10 12 Cartman "Who are they??
"
10 12 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
10 12 Cartman "I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
"
10 12 Cartman "What??
"
10 13 Cartman "Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
"
10 13 Cartman "We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
"
10 13 Cartman "Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 
"
10 13 Cartman "I got it! I got the Wii!
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
"
10 13 Cartman "Here. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
"
10 13 Cartman "There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
"
10 13 Cartman "You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
"
10 13 Cartman "I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
"
10 13 Cartman "Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
"
10 13 Cartman "God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Tell me about it.
"
10 13 Cartman "What?
"
10 13 Cartman "Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
"
10 13 Cartman "I care! Where's the closest toy store??
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on! Come on!
"
10 13 Cartman "Ugh, finally!
"
10 13 Cartman "I want one of those time-phone things.
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
"
10 13 Cartman "Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Look, I have to have one of those phones!
"
10 13 Cartman "How about a robot? How much for the robot?
"
10 13 Cartman "Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
"
10 13 Cartman "I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
"
10 13 Cartman "Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
"
10 13 Cartman "Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh God!  Hello? 
"
10 13 Cartman "Who is this?
"
10 13 Cartman "What?? Who the hell is this?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Me who?!
"
10 13 Cartman "What?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Oh very funny, Kyle!
"
10 13 Cartman "Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
"
10 13 Cartman "Listen to this!  Dickhead. 
"
10 13 Cartman "Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
"
10 13 Cartman "Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
"
10 13 Cartman "What??  Who the fuck is this?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Suck my balls!
"
10 13 Cartman "...Okay, you have one minute.
"
10 13 Cartman "Are you spying on me?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
"
10 13 Cartman "This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
"
10 13 Cartman "What is the Great Question?
"
10 13 Cartman "I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
"
10 13 Cartman "Who?
"
10 13 Cartman "Garrison? But he's an asshole.
"
10 13 Cartman "It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
"
10 13 Cartman "I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
"
10 13 Cartman "Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
"
10 13 Cartman "Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
"
10 13 Cartman "Go... Right... Where am I going? 
"
10 13 Cartman "Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
"
10 13 Cartman "So there is no war now in the future.
"
10 13 Cartman "And what was that purpose again?
"
10 13 Cartman "Right... 
"
10 13 Cartman "I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
"
10 13 Cartman "Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
"
10 13 Cartman "Mom! Mom, they did it!
"
10 13 Cartman "No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
10 13 Cartman "What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
"
10 13 Cartman "I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
"
10 13 Cartman "Hello?
"
10 13 Cartman "...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 
"
