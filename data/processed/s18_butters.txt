18 3 Butters "That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"
18 3 Butters "He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me.

18 3 Butters "Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
18 3 Butters "Just hold it. That's what I do now.

18 3 Butters "Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
"
18 3 Butters "Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
"
18 3 Butters "Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy!

18 5 Butters "Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.

18 5 Butters "My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
"
18 5 Butters "You can see the momma bird fly in.
"
18 5 Butters "We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"
18 5 Butters "You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
"
18 5 Butters "It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
"
18 5 Butters "Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
"
18 5 Butters "My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
18 5 Butters "Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.

"
18 5 Butters "I love you too, Dad.

18 5 Butters "When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
"
18 5 Butters "You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
"
18 5 Butters "Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
18 5 Butters "WHY?!
"
18 5 Butters "I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
"
18 5 Butters "Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why?!
"
18 5 Butters "That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
"
18 5 Butters "Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.

"
18 5 Butters "I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
"
18 5 Butters "I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
"
18 5 Butters "I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
"
18 5 Butters "You do?
"
18 5 Butters "What?
"
18 5 Butters "NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
"
18 5 Butters "...Okay.

18 7 Butters "How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"
18 7 Butters "Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.

18 7 Butters "There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"
18 7 Butters "Okay, I got it!

18 7 Butters "Already? Oh no!

18 7 Butters "Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
18 7 Butters "Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.

18 7 Butters "I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"
18 7 Butters "Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
18 7 Butters "I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"
18 7 Butters "I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
"
18 7 Butters "I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
"
18 7 Butters "Aw nuts!

18 7 Butters "I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
"
18 7 Butters "Ahhh!

"
18 7 Butters "Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
"
18 7 Butters "Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
"
18 7 Butters "When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
"
18 7 Butters "YES.

"
18 10 Butters "I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
"
18 10 Butters "Well, gay is wholesome.
"
18 9 Butters "What's a PewDiePie do?
"
18 9 Butters "Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
"
18 9 Butters "It's true!
"
18 9 Butters "Heheyehah.
"
18 1 Butters "Rotten boobie turds!
"
18 1 Butters "Man this sucks!

18 1 Butters "We already got a dollar!
"
18 1 Butters "One dollar pledge!

18 1 Butters "It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
"
18 1 Butters "Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
"
18 1 Butters "Somebody killed Kickstarter!

18 1 Butters "Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
"
18 1 Butters "We finally did it!
"
18 3 Butters "Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
"
18 3 Butters "I think someone's in there.
"
18 3 Butters "That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"
18 3 Butters "He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
"
18 3 Butters "Holy moly! 
"
18 3 Butters "Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
18 3 Butters "Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
"
18 3 Butters "Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
"
18 3 Butters "Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
"
18 3 Butters "Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
"
18 3 Butters "Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
"
18 5 Butters "Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
"
18 5 Butters "Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
"
18 5 Butters "I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
"
18 5 Butters "My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
"
18 5 Butters "You can see the momma bird fly in.
"
18 5 Butters "We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"
18 5 Butters "You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
"
18 5 Butters "It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
"
18 5 Butters "Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
"
18 5 Butters "My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
18 5 Butters "Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
"
18 5 Butters "No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
"
18 5 Butters "Comin' dad! 
"
18 5 Butters "Yes, it's me.
"
18 5 Butters "Of course not!
"
18 5 Butters "What?! You said nobody would know!
"
18 5 Butters "Be careful! The powerlines!
"
18 5 Butters "Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
"
18 5 Butters "Let me see!
"
18 5 Butters "Jeeeeezz!
"
18 5 Butters "What do I do?!
"
18 5 Butters "I don't know what to do!
"
18 5 Butters "Oh, heh-hey dad.
"
18 5 Butters "Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
"
18 5 Butters "I love you too, Dad. 
"
18 5 Butters "What the heck are you doing?!
"
18 5 Butters "When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
"
18 5 Butters "You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
"
18 5 Butters "Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
18 5 Butters "WHY?!
"
18 5 Butters "I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
"
18 5 Butters "Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
18 5 Butters "Why?!
"
18 5 Butters "That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
"
18 5 Butters "Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
"
18 5 Butters "I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
"
18 5 Butters "I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
"
18 5 Butters "I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
"
18 5 Butters "I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
"
18 5 Butters "You do?
"
18 5 Butters "What?
"
18 5 Butters "NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
"
18 5 Butters "...Okay.
"
18 5 Butters "If this doesn't work, we're dead.
"
18 5 Butters "Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
"
18 5 Butters "No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
"
18 6 Butters "Congratulations, Kyle.
"
18 6 Butters "Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
"
18 6 Butters "We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
"
18 7 Butters "WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
"
18 7 Butters "I feel Stan! He looks totally real!

18 7 Butters "Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
"
18 7 Butters "What what what?

18 7 Butters "Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!

18 7 Butters "I'm sorry!

18 7 Butters "I touched Wendy's boobs. 
"
18 7 Butters "Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
"
18 7 Butters "You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
"
18 7 Butters "Yeah.

"
18 7 Butters "Okay.
"
18 7 Butters "How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"
18 7 Butters "Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
"
18 7 Butters "There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"
18 7 Butters "Okay, I got it!
"
18 7 Butters "Already? Oh no!

18 7 Butters "I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
"
18 7 Butters "Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
"
18 7 Butters "This is for all the times I got grounded! 
"
18 7 Butters "HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!

18 7 Butters "Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
"
18 7 Butters "Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
18 7 Butters "Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
"
18 7 Butters "I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"
18 7 Butters "Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
18 7 Butters "I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"
18 7 Butters "I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!

18 7 Butters "I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
"
18 7 Butters "Aw nuts!

18 7 Butters "I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
"
18 7 Butters "Ahhh!

"
18 7 Butters "No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
"
18 7 Butters "I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
"
18 7 Butters "PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
