3 1 Craig "No I didn't.
"
3 4 Craig "No.
"
3 4 Craig "No.
"
3 4 Craig "He did?
"
3 4 Craig "Why would he say that?
"
3 4 Craig "Well, I've gotta go over there and-
"
3 4 Craig "Okay. 
"
3 4 Craig "Red Racer's on.
"
3 4 Craig "I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
"
3 4 Craig "Nope. 
"
3 4 Craig "What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
"
3 4 Craig "That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
"
3 4 Craig "After Red Racer.
"
3 4 Craig "Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
"
3 4 Craig "Some kid.
"
3 4 Craig "Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!
"
3 4 Craig "I uh...
"
3 4 Craig "What do we do?
"
3 4 Craig "I've never been in a fight before.
"
3 4 Craig "Meatloaf?
"
3 4 Craig "Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!
"
3 4 Craig "How can I resist an ass so great?
"
3 4 Craig "This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 
"
3 4 Craig "Okay.
"
3 4 Craig "Okay, okay!
"
3 4 Craig "Respect my authority.
"
3 4 Craig "Ugh.
"
3 4 Craig "What was on the news?
"
3 4 Craig "Huh?
"
3 4 Craig "I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
3 6 Craig "This girl touched my thigh.
"
3 6 Craig "Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
"
3 6 Craig "Incriminate.
"
3 13 Craig "Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
"
3 13 Craig "Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
"
3 13 Craig "Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
"
3 13 Craig "Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?
"
3 13 Craig "Get him! 
"
3 13 Craig "Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
"
3 13 Craig "That's the point, buttpipe.
"
3 13 Craig "Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 
"
3 13 Craig "Oh my God!
"
3 13 Craig "No! He's my friend!
"
3 1 Craig "I know.
