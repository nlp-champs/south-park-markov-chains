11 1 Kyle "Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
11 1 Kyle "I don't know.
"
11 1 Kyle "Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
"
11 1 Kyle "I have no idea.
"
11 1 Kyle "I don't get it either.
"
11 1 Kyle "...Huh?
"
11 2 Kyle "Is this all you brought us here to see?
"
11 2 Kyle "Butters is staying over tonight?
"
11 2 Kyle "Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
"
11 2 Kyle "Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"
11 2 Kyle "I mean, that if-
"
11 2 Kyle "Hrrugh! 
"
11 2 Kyle "Dude!
"
11 2 Kyle "No dude, that makes you gay!
"
11 2 Kyle "You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
"
11 2 Kyle "Yeah huh!
"
11 2 Kyle "Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"
11 2 Kyle "Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
"
11 2 Kyle "The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
"
11 2 Kyle "Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
11 2 Kyle "...Idiot.
"
11 2 Kyle "What are you talking about, fatass?
"
11 2 Kyle "You figured that out, huh?
"
11 2 Kyle "Except for us.
"
11 2 Kyle "And all the people we tell.
"
11 2 Kyle "Like what?
"
11 2 Kyle "Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
11 2 Kyle "Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
"
11 2 Kyle "Okay, my turn. 
"
11 2 Kyle "Where's what?
"
11 2 Kyle "Let go of me.
"
11 2 Kyle "Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
"
11 2 Kyle "I don't have it!
"
11 2 Kyle "Shut up!
"
11 2 Kyle "Ow! Quit it, dude!
"
11 2 Kyle "He isn't actually going to show everyone...
"
11 3 Kyle "You know what? I'll bet it was you!
"
11 3 Kyle "This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"
11 3 Kyle "Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
"
11 3 Kyle "It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
11 3 Kyle "It was him. It had to have been him!
"
11 3 Kyle "What's this about, Cartman? 
"
11 3 Kyle "That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
"
11 3 Kyle "You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
"
11 3 Kyle "Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
11 3 Kyle "All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
"
11 3 Kyle "It doesn't prove anything!
"
11 3 Kyle "No way.
"
11 3 Kyle "Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
"
11 3 Kyle "Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
"
11 3 Kyle "I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah?
"
11 4 Kyle "What? No, I'm sick. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude, leave me alone.
"
11 4 Kyle "What? Why?
"
11 4 Kyle "All right, all right. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
"
11 4 Kyle "Over a hundred.
"
11 4 Kyle "White Stripes
"
11 4 Kyle "What?
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
"
11 4 Kyle "I guess so.
"
11 4 Kyle "Wuh what doesn't follow?
"
11 4 Kyle "Okay.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. Actually, there is.
"
11 4 Kyle "There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
"
11 4 Kyle "So then maybe you're wrong.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah.  What is that?
"
11 4 Kyle "God damn it Cartman!
"
11 4 Kyle "I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
"
11 4 Kyle "No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
"
11 4 Kyle "Oh that's a good idea. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
"
11 4 Kyle "Hey.
"
11 4 Kyle "What's going on?
"
11 4 Kyle "...Homeland Security?
"
11 4 Kyle "Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
"
11 4 Kyle "Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
11 4 Kyle "Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
"
11 4 Kyle "...Not anymore you're not.
"
11 4 Kyle "I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
"
11 4 Kyle "All right! MapQuest the address!
"
11 4 Kyle "Good thinking
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
"
11 4 Kyle "...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
"
11 4 Kyle "...Maybe. 
"
11 4 Kyle "...That is so missing the point.
"
11 4 Kyle "The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
"
11 4 Kyle "No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
"
11 5 Kyle "What happened?
"
11 5 Kyle "...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
11 5 Kyle "Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
"
11 5 Kyle "Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
"
11 5 Kyle "The history of Easter.
"
11 5 Kyle "It kind of looks like... an egg.
"
11 5 Kyle "Who is Saint Peter?
"
11 5 Kyle "Peter Rabbit.
"
11 5 Kyle "I don't see it.
"
11 5 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
11 5 Kyle "So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
"
11 5 Kyle "So what now?
"
11 5 Kyle "You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
"
11 5 Kyle "I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
"
11 5 Kyle "You swore on the cross, fatso!
"
11 5 Kyle "Don't you have any superpowers?
"
11 5 Kyle "What?
"
11 5 Kyle "N-no way! Do it yourself.
"
11 5 Kyle "Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
"
11 5 Kyle "Don't make me do this.
"
11 5 Kyle "Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"
11 5 Kyle "Happy Easter, Jesus. 
"
11 5 Kyle "...Jesus?
"
11 6 Kyle "Oh God, here we go again.
"
11 6 Kyle "Our whole weekend is shot.
"
11 6 Kyle "They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
"
11 6 Kyle "What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"
11 6 Kyle "He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
"
11 6 Kyle "You said you all wrote essays.
"
11 6 Kyle "Dude, we're totally fucked now!
"
11 6 Kyle "This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
"
11 6 Kyle "Son of a bitch! 
"
11 6 Kyle "Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
11 6 Kyle "We're dead.
"
11 6 Kyle "Really?
"
11 6 Kyle "Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
"
11 7 Kyle "Fine.
"
11 7 Kyle "You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
"
11 7 Kyle "Really?
"
11 7 Kyle "Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
11 7 Kyle "God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
"
11 7 Kyle "Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
"
11 7 Kyle "No, that... I thought that was a lot.
"
11 7 Kyle "You're welcome. 
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh crap. 
"
11 7 Kyle "I don't know.
"
11 7 Kyle "He did?
"
11 7 Kyle "Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
"
11 7 Kyle "I don't want you to jump them, retard!
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh my God.
"
11 7 Kyle "Holy shit, dude! 
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
"
11 7 Kyle "You barely made it over one, fatass!
"
11 7 Kyle "God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
"
11 7 Kyle "What's it doing?
"
11 7 Kyle "What about you?
"
11 7 Kyle "We're nine.
"
11 7 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
11 7 Kyle "You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
"
11 7 Kyle "I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"
11 7 Kyle "No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
"
11 7 Kyle "That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
"
11 7 Kyle "We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"
11 7 Kyle "All right, hit it.
"
11 7 Kyle "City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
"
11 8 Kyle "Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?
"
11 8 Kyle "What?
"
11 8 Kyle "He's faking.
"
11 8 Kyle "You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
"
11 8 Kyle "Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"
11 8 Kyle "Grrhh, whatever. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Will you knock it off already?!
"
11 8 Kyle "Don't push me, asshole!
"
11 8 Kyle "No! Up yours, fatboy!
"
11 8 Kyle "Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
"
11 8 Kyle "N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
"
11 8 Kyle "L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
11 8 Kyle "Dude...
"
11 8 Kyle "Aw, come on!
"
11 8 Kyle "Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
11 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.
"
11 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.
"
11 8 Kyle "I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
"
11 8 Kyle "What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
"
11 8 Kyle "Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
"
11 8 Kyle "...Scotch?
"
11 8 Kyle "You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
"
11 8 Kyle "It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
"
11 8 Kyle "What did you say?
"
11 8 Kyle "You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
"
11 8 Kyle "Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
11 8 Kyle "You sure you don't wanna back out?
"
11 8 Kyle "All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Surprise, fatass!
"
11 8 Kyle "I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
"
11 8 Kyle "Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
"
11 8 Kyle "What?
"
11 8 Kyle "No, I- I beat you!
"
11 10 Kyle "This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
"
11 10 Kyle "Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
11 10 Kyle "This is fucking retarded!
"
11 10 Kyle "Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
11 10 Kyle "Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
"
11 10 Kyle "You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
"
11 10 Kyle "Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
"
11 10 Kyle "So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
"
11 10 Kyle "I thought I did. 
"
11 10 Kyle "Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
"
11 10 Kyle "I'm not doing it, fatass!
"
11 10 Kyle "Just get out of here!
"
11 10 Kyle "I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"
11 10 Kyle "That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
"
11 10 Kyle "Hey dudes. 
"
11 10 Kyle "How was what?
"
11 10 Kyle "I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
"
11 10 Kyle "Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
"
11 10 Kyle "All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude.
"
11 10 Kyle "Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"
11 10 Kyle "STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude! 
"
11 10 Kyle "A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
"
11 10 Kyle "...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
"
11 10 Kyle "What did they say??
"
11 10 Kyle "...Dude...
"
11 10 Kyle "I...
"
11 10 Kyle "Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
"
11 10 Kyle "Let's just get this over with!
"
11 10 Kyle "God damnit!
"
11 10 Kyle "Who are you?
"
11 11 Kyle "WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
"
11 11 Kyle "We just... went on a balloon ride.
"
11 11 Kyle "...What?
"
11 11 Kyle "Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
"
11 11 Kyle "Ah I guess.
"
11 11 Kyle "Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
"
11 11 Kyle "No, no dude, it went up there.
"
11 11 Kyle "Imagina-eh
"
11 11 Kyle "Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" 
"
11 11 Kyle "Cartman??
"
11 11 Kyle "I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
"
11 11 Kyle "Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
"
11 11 Kyle "Stan?
"
11 11 Kyle "I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!
"
11 11 Kyle "Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
11 11 Kyle "Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
"
11 11 Kyle "No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
"
11 11 Kyle "Just get to it already!
"
11 11 Kyle "Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
"
11 11 Kyle "Let's just DO IT! 
"
11 11 Kyle "AAAHHH! 
"
11 11 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan? 
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan?
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, what's happened?
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
"
11 12 Kyle "Arh!
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
"
11 12 Kyle "Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
"
11 12 Kyle "Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh for the love of God!
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan! Dude, is that you?
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
"
11 12 Kyle "Dude, what's happening?
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh no.
"
11 12 Kyle "The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
"
11 12 Kyle "What am I supposed to do?
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan? Stan?? 
"
11 12 Kyle "I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
"
11 12 Kyle "Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"
11 12 Kyle "Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
"
11 12 Kyle "Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
"
11 12 Kyle "Nothing.
"
11 12 Kyle "Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
"
11 12 Kyle "They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"
11 12 Kyle "No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
"
11 12 Kyle "Huh? 
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh boy...
"
11 12 Kyle "Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
"
11 12 Kyle "Aah.
"
11 12 Kyle "Yeah, I guess.
"
11 12 Kyle "Hi Superman.
"
11 12 Kyle "I know.
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh God...
"
11 12 Kyle "Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
"
11 12 Kyle "You have to stop!
"
11 12 Kyle "Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
"
11 12 Kyle "Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, don't!
"
11 12 Kyle "I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
"
11 12 Kyle "I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"
11 13 Kyle "Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
"
11 13 Kyle "Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
"
11 13 Kyle "For reals? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
11 13 Kyle "Do we? He's a legend!
"
11 13 Kyle "Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
"
11 13 Kyle "D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, okay. Cool. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Hey dude, how'd it-? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Who is this?
"
11 13 Kyle "Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
"
11 13 Kyle "But it's our game. We bought it together.
"
11 13 Kyle "Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
11 13 Kyle "I have been sick!
"
11 13 Kyle "I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
11 13 Kyle "I'm not done yet.
"
11 13 Kyle "No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"
11 13 Kyle "Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
"
11 13 Kyle "Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
"
11 13 Kyle "I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
11 13 Kyle "Thanks, Mick.
"
11 13 Kyle "What are you doing here? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
"
11 13 Kyle "You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
"
11 13 Kyle "It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
"
11 13 Kyle "Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
"
11 13 Kyle "I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"
11 13 Kyle "I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
"
11 13 Kyle "Thanks, Mick! 
"
11 13 Kyle "Goddammit! God dammit! 
"
11 14 Kyle "You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
"
11 14 Kyle "You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
"
11 14 Kyle "Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
"
11 14 Kyle "No way.
"
11 14 Kyle "I'm last? Last?
"
11 14 Kyle "I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
11 14 Kyle "The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"
11 14 Kyle "Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
"
11 14 Kyle "Oh God! I do?
"
11 14 Kyle "Ahahah!
"
11 14 Kyle "Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
"
11 14 Kyle "Hrrgh! 
"
11 14 Kyle "Hello. 
"
11 14 Kyle "Yeah.
"
11 14 Kyle "No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"
11 14 Kyle "No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
"
11 14 Kyle "Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
"
11 14 Kyle "They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
"
11 14 Kyle "Who said that?
"
11 14 Kyle "Abraham Lincoln?
"
11 14 Kyle "But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
"
11 14 Kyle "Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
"
11 14 Kyle "I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
"
11 14 Kyle "That should just about do it.
"
11 14 Kyle "All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
"
11 14 Kyle "Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
"
11 14 Kyle "Huh??
"
11 14 Kyle "Stan, what is going on?!
"
11 14 Kyle "So what number was I??
"
11 14 Kyle "She's gonna kill us?
"
11 14 Kyle "I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
"
11 1 Kyle "Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
11 1 Kyle "I don't know.
"
11 1 Kyle "Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
"
11 1 Kyle "I have no idea.
"
11 1 Kyle "I don't get it either.
"
11 1 Kyle "...Huh?
"
11 2 Kyle "Is this all you brought us here to see?
"
11 2 Kyle "Butters is staying over tonight?
"
11 2 Kyle "Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
"
11 2 Kyle "Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"
11 2 Kyle "I mean, that if-
"
11 2 Kyle "Hrrugh! 
"
11 2 Kyle "Dude!
"
11 2 Kyle "No dude, that makes you gay!
"
11 2 Kyle "You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
"
11 2 Kyle "Yeah huh!
"
11 2 Kyle "Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"
11 2 Kyle "Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
"
11 2 Kyle "The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
"
11 2 Kyle "Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
11 2 Kyle "...Idiot.
"
11 2 Kyle "What are you talking about, fatass?
"
11 2 Kyle "You figured that out, huh?
"
11 2 Kyle "Except for us.
"
11 2 Kyle "And all the people we tell.
"
11 2 Kyle "Like what?
"
11 2 Kyle "Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
11 2 Kyle "Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
"
11 2 Kyle "Okay, my turn. 
"
11 2 Kyle "Where's what?
"
11 2 Kyle "Let go of me.
"
11 2 Kyle "Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
"
11 2 Kyle "I don't have it!
"
11 2 Kyle "Shut up!
"
11 2 Kyle "Ow! Quit it, dude!
"
11 2 Kyle "He isn't actually going to show everyone...
"
11 3 Kyle "You know what? I'll bet it was you!
"
11 3 Kyle "This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"
11 3 Kyle "Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
"
11 3 Kyle "It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
11 3 Kyle "It was him. It had to have been him!
"
11 3 Kyle "What's this about, Cartman? 
"
11 3 Kyle "That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
"
11 3 Kyle "You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
"
11 3 Kyle "Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
11 3 Kyle "All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
"
11 3 Kyle "It doesn't prove anything!
"
11 3 Kyle "No way.
"
11 3 Kyle "Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
"
11 3 Kyle "Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
"
11 3 Kyle "I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah?
"
11 4 Kyle "What? No, I'm sick. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude, leave me alone.
"
11 4 Kyle "What? Why?
"
11 4 Kyle "All right, all right. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
"
11 4 Kyle "Over a hundred.
"
11 4 Kyle "White Stripes
"
11 4 Kyle "What?
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
"
11 4 Kyle "I guess so.
"
11 4 Kyle "Wuh what doesn't follow?
"
11 4 Kyle "Okay.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. Actually, there is.
"
11 4 Kyle "There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
"
11 4 Kyle "So then maybe you're wrong.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah.  What is that?
"
11 4 Kyle "God damn it Cartman!
"
11 4 Kyle "I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
"
11 4 Kyle "No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
"
11 4 Kyle "Oh that's a good idea. 
"
11 4 Kyle "Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
"
11 4 Kyle "Hey.
"
11 4 Kyle "What's going on?
"
11 4 Kyle "...Homeland Security?
"
11 4 Kyle "Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
"
11 4 Kyle "Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
11 4 Kyle "Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
"
11 4 Kyle "...Not anymore you're not.
"
11 4 Kyle "I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
"
11 4 Kyle "All right! MapQuest the address!
"
11 4 Kyle "Good thinking
"
11 4 Kyle "Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
"
11 4 Kyle "...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
"
11 4 Kyle "...Maybe. 
"
11 4 Kyle "...That is so missing the point.
"
11 4 Kyle "The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
"
11 4 Kyle "No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
"
11 5 Kyle "What happened?
"
11 5 Kyle "...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
11 5 Kyle "Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
"
11 5 Kyle "Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
"
11 5 Kyle "The history of Easter.
"
11 5 Kyle "It kind of looks like... an egg.
"
11 5 Kyle "Who is Saint Peter?
"
11 5 Kyle "Peter Rabbit.
"
11 5 Kyle "I don't see it.
"
11 5 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
11 5 Kyle "So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
"
11 5 Kyle "So what now?
"
11 5 Kyle "You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
"
11 5 Kyle "I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
"
11 5 Kyle "You swore on the cross, fatso!
"
11 5 Kyle "Don't you have any superpowers?
"
11 5 Kyle "What?
"
11 5 Kyle "N-no way! Do it yourself.
"
11 5 Kyle "Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
"
11 5 Kyle "Don't make me do this.
"
11 5 Kyle "Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"
11 5 Kyle "Happy Easter, Jesus. 
"
11 5 Kyle "...Jesus?
"
11 6 Kyle "Oh God, here we go again.
"
11 6 Kyle "Our whole weekend is shot.
"
11 6 Kyle "They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
"
11 6 Kyle "What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"
11 6 Kyle "He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
"
11 6 Kyle "You said you all wrote essays.
"
11 6 Kyle "Dude, we're totally fucked now!
"
11 6 Kyle "This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
"
11 6 Kyle "Son of a bitch! 
"
11 6 Kyle "Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
11 6 Kyle "We're dead.
"
11 6 Kyle "Really?
"
11 6 Kyle "Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
"
11 7 Kyle "Fine.
"
11 7 Kyle "You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
"
11 7 Kyle "Really?
"
11 7 Kyle "Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
11 7 Kyle "God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
"
11 7 Kyle "Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
"
11 7 Kyle "No, that... I thought that was a lot.
"
11 7 Kyle "You're welcome. 
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh crap. 
"
11 7 Kyle "I don't know.
"
11 7 Kyle "He did?
"
11 7 Kyle "Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
"
11 7 Kyle "I don't want you to jump them, retard!
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh my God.
"
11 7 Kyle "Holy shit, dude! 
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
"
11 7 Kyle "You barely made it over one, fatass!
"
11 7 Kyle "God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
"
11 7 Kyle "What's it doing?
"
11 7 Kyle "What about you?
"
11 7 Kyle "We're nine.
"
11 7 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
11 7 Kyle "Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
11 7 Kyle "You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
"
11 7 Kyle "I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"
11 7 Kyle "No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
"
11 7 Kyle "That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
"
11 7 Kyle "We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"
11 7 Kyle "All right, hit it.
"
11 7 Kyle "City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
"
11 8 Kyle "Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?
"
11 8 Kyle "What?
"
11 8 Kyle "He's faking.
"
11 8 Kyle "You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
"
11 8 Kyle "Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"
11 8 Kyle "Grrhh, whatever. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Will you knock it off already?!
"
11 8 Kyle "Don't push me, asshole!
"
11 8 Kyle "No! Up yours, fatboy!
"
11 8 Kyle "Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
"
11 8 Kyle "N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
"
11 8 Kyle "L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
11 8 Kyle "Dude...
"
11 8 Kyle "Aw, come on!
"
11 8 Kyle "Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
11 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.
"
11 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.
"
11 8 Kyle "I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
"
11 8 Kyle "What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
"
11 8 Kyle "Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
"
11 8 Kyle "...Scotch?
"
11 8 Kyle "You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
"
11 8 Kyle "It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
"
11 8 Kyle "What did you say?
"
11 8 Kyle "You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
"
11 8 Kyle "Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
11 8 Kyle "You sure you don't wanna back out?
"
11 8 Kyle "All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
"
11 8 Kyle "Surprise, fatass!
"
11 8 Kyle "I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
"
11 8 Kyle "Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
"
11 8 Kyle "What?
"
11 8 Kyle "No, I- I beat you!
"
11 10 Kyle "This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
"
11 10 Kyle "Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
11 10 Kyle "This is fucking retarded!
"
11 10 Kyle "Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
11 10 Kyle "Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
"
11 10 Kyle "You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
"
11 10 Kyle "Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
"
11 10 Kyle "So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
"
11 10 Kyle "I thought I did. 
"
11 10 Kyle "Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
"
11 10 Kyle "I'm not doing it, fatass!
"
11 10 Kyle "Just get out of here!
"
11 10 Kyle "I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"
11 10 Kyle "That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
"
11 10 Kyle "Hey dudes. 
"
11 10 Kyle "How was what?
"
11 10 Kyle "I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
"
11 10 Kyle "Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
"
11 10 Kyle "All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude.
"
11 10 Kyle "Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"
11 10 Kyle "STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude! 
"
11 10 Kyle "A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
"
11 10 Kyle "...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
11 10 Kyle "Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
"
11 10 Kyle "What did they say??
"
11 10 Kyle "...Dude...
"
11 10 Kyle "I...
"
11 10 Kyle "Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
"
11 10 Kyle "Let's just get this over with!
"
11 10 Kyle "God damnit!
"
11 10 Kyle "Who are you?
"
11 11 Kyle "WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
"
11 11 Kyle "We just... went on a balloon ride.
"
11 11 Kyle "...What?
"
11 11 Kyle "Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
"
11 11 Kyle "Ah I guess.
"
11 11 Kyle "Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
"
11 11 Kyle "No, no dude, it went up there.
"
11 11 Kyle "Imagina-eh
"
11 11 Kyle "Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" 
"
11 11 Kyle "Cartman??
"
11 11 Kyle "I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
"
11 11 Kyle "Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
"
11 11 Kyle "Stan?
"
11 11 Kyle "I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!
"
11 11 Kyle "Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
11 11 Kyle "Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
"
11 11 Kyle "No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
"
11 11 Kyle "Just get to it already!
"
11 11 Kyle "Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
"
11 11 Kyle "Let's just DO IT! 
"
11 11 Kyle "AAAHHH! 
"
11 11 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan? 
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan?
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, what's happened?
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
"
11 12 Kyle "Arh!
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
"
11 12 Kyle "Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
"
11 12 Kyle "Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh for the love of God!
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan! Dude, is that you?
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
"
11 12 Kyle "Dude, what's happening?
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh no.
"
11 12 Kyle "The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
"
11 12 Kyle "What am I supposed to do?
"
11 12 Kyle "Stan? Stan?? 
"
11 12 Kyle "I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"
11 12 Kyle "No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
"
11 12 Kyle "Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"
11 12 Kyle "Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
"
11 12 Kyle "Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
"
11 12 Kyle "Nothing.
"
11 12 Kyle "Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
"
11 12 Kyle "They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"
11 12 Kyle "No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
"
11 12 Kyle "Huh? 
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh boy...
"
11 12 Kyle "Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
"
11 12 Kyle "Aah.
"
11 12 Kyle "Yeah, I guess.
"
11 12 Kyle "Hi Superman.
"
11 12 Kyle "I know.
"
11 12 Kyle "Oh God...
"
11 12 Kyle "Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
"
11 12 Kyle "You have to stop!
"
11 12 Kyle "Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
"
11 12 Kyle "Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
"
11 12 Kyle "Cartman, don't!
"
11 12 Kyle "I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
"
11 12 Kyle "I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"
11 13 Kyle "Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
"
11 13 Kyle "Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
"
11 13 Kyle "For reals? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
11 13 Kyle "Do we? He's a legend!
"
11 13 Kyle "Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
"
11 13 Kyle "D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, okay. Cool. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Hey dude, how'd it-? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Who is this?
"
11 13 Kyle "Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
"
11 13 Kyle "But it's our game. We bought it together.
"
11 13 Kyle "Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
11 13 Kyle "I have been sick!
"
11 13 Kyle "I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
11 13 Kyle "I'm not done yet.
"
11 13 Kyle "No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"
11 13 Kyle "Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
"
11 13 Kyle "Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
"
11 13 Kyle "I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
11 13 Kyle "Thanks, Mick.
"
11 13 Kyle "What are you doing here? 
"
11 13 Kyle "Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
"
11 13 Kyle "You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
"
11 13 Kyle "It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
"
11 13 Kyle "Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
"
11 13 Kyle "I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"
11 13 Kyle "I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
"
11 13 Kyle "Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
"
11 13 Kyle "Thanks, Mick! 
"
11 13 Kyle "Goddammit! God dammit! 
"
11 14 Kyle "You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
"
11 14 Kyle "You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
"
11 14 Kyle "Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
"
11 14 Kyle "No way.
"
11 14 Kyle "I'm last? Last?
"
11 14 Kyle "I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
11 14 Kyle "The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"
11 14 Kyle "Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
"
11 14 Kyle "Oh God! I do?
"
11 14 Kyle "Ahahah!
"
11 14 Kyle "Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
"
11 14 Kyle "Hrrgh! 
"
11 14 Kyle "Hello. 
"
11 14 Kyle "Yeah.
"
11 14 Kyle "No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"
11 14 Kyle "No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
"
11 14 Kyle "Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
"
11 14 Kyle "They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
"
11 14 Kyle "Who said that?
"
11 14 Kyle "Abraham Lincoln?
"
11 14 Kyle "But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
"
11 14 Kyle "Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
"
11 14 Kyle "I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
"
11 14 Kyle "That should just about do it.
"
11 14 Kyle "All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
"
11 14 Kyle "Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
"
11 14 Kyle "Huh??
"
11 14 Kyle "Stan, what is going on?!
"
11 14 Kyle "So what number was I??
"
11 14 Kyle "She's gonna kill us?
"
11 14 Kyle "I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
