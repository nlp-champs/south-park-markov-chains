"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all.  Do the other kids make fun of ya?
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "And that must make you mad.
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "Mad enough to kill, Kyle??? 
"
1 9 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh that's good.  You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?

"
1 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
"
1 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
"
1 10 "Mr. Mackey" "Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. Nde no no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. Yeeu be passive, mkay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
"
1 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Oh, well, there's a news flash!

1 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, mkay?
"
1 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
"
1 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Well-obviously something is bothering him.  Oh, of course!  My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, mkay?
