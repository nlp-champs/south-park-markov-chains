18 9 Cartman "That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.

18 9 Cartman "Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"

"
18 9 Cartman "There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.

18 9 Cartman "This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
"
18 9 Cartman "What the hell did I do?
"
18 9 Cartman "Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
"
18 9 Cartman "Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.

"
18 1 Cartman "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
"
18 1 Cartman "You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
18 1 Cartman "Washington. Redskins. 
"
18 1 Cartman "It's sooo sweet!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
18 1 Cartman "Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
"
18 1 Cartman "Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
"
18 1 Cartman "We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
"
18 1 Cartman "I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!
"
18 1 Cartman "Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
"
18 1 Cartman "By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
"
18 1 Cartman "Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
"
18 1 Cartman "Yes, I know.
"
18 1 Cartman "Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
"
18 1 Cartman "Nice, I like that.
"
18 1 Cartman "Stop? But why?
"
18 1 Cartman "Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
"
18 1 Cartman "How is it offensive?
"
18 1 Cartman "Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
"
18 1 Cartman "Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
"
18 1 Cartman "Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
"
18 1 Cartman "NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
18 1 Cartman "Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
"
18 1 Cartman "Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
"
18 1 Cartman "Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! 
"
18 1 Cartman "Goooood morning, guys!
"
18 1 Cartman "We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
"
18 1 Cartman "What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
"
18 1 Cartman "What?!
"
18 1 Cartman "Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
"
18 1 Cartman "You song of a bitch!
"
18 1 Cartman "You broke Kickstarter!
"
18 1 Cartman "Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, somebody did!
"
18 1 Cartman "A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
"
18 1 Cartman "It is really sweet.
"
18 1 Cartman "Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
"
18 1 Cartman "You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
"
18 1 Cartman "I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Whoa, whoa! What?
"
18 1 Cartman "I guess we gotta go back to school. 
"
18 2 Cartman "How's it going, everybody?
"
18 2 Cartman "Hey dude. Sup? 
"
18 2 Cartman "What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
"
18 2 Cartman "Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
"
18 2 Cartman "Dude, people are pissed off at us.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
"
18 2 Cartman "You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
"
18 2 Cartman "Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
"
18 2 Cartman "Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
"
18 2 Cartman "What?
"
18 2 Cartman "We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
"
18 2 Cartman "Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
"
18 2 Cartman "So who do we throw the party for?
"
18 2 Cartman "You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
"
18 2 Cartman "You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"
18 2 Cartman """I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.""
"
18 2 Cartman "Believe it, dude.
"
18 2 Cartman "What the hell is gluten?
"
18 2 Cartman "KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
"
18 2 Cartman "What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
18 2 Cartman "You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
"
18 2 Cartman "There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
"
18 2 Cartman "Aunt Jemima. 
"
18 2 Cartman "I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
"
18 2 Cartman "I don't even know what that means.
"
18 2 Cartman "Are you going to eat those pancakes?
"
18 2 Cartman "Oooo, trippy...
"
18 2 Cartman "They've got what backward? 
"
18 2 Cartman "Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
"
18 2 Cartman "My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
"
18 2 Cartman "What, what is it? What is it for?
"
18 2 Cartman "It's upside down.
"
18 2 Cartman "Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
"
18 3 Cartman "Good for you. 
"
18 3 Cartman "No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
18 3 Cartman "I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
"
18 3 Cartman "Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
"
18 3 Cartman "Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
18 3 Cartman "I'm going to the potty.
"
18 3 Cartman "Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
"
18 3 Cartman "Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
18 3 Cartman "Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
"
18 3 Cartman "It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
"
18 3 Cartman "That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
"
18 3 Cartman "Erica.
"
18 3 Cartman "All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
"
18 3 Cartman "There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
"
18 3 Cartman "Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
"
18 3 Cartman "I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
"
18 3 Cartman "OH MY GOD!
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh on that side?
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
"
18 3 Cartman "It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
"
18 3 Cartman "Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" 
"
18 3 Cartman "Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
"
18 3 Cartman "I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
"
18 3 Cartman "Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
18 3 Cartman "Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
"
18 3 Cartman "No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
"
18 3 Cartman "Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
"
18 3 Cartman "Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
18 3 Cartman "Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
"
18 3 Cartman "He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
"
18 3 Cartman "At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
"
18 3 Cartman "I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
"
18 5 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
18 5 Cartman "That's stupid.
"
18 5 Cartman "I'm dying of boredom.
"
18 5 Cartman "What did you say?
"
18 5 Cartman "Your dad has a fucking drone?
"
18 5 Cartman "Whooaa! 
"
18 5 Cartman "You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
18 5 Cartman "Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, is that you?
"
18 5 Cartman "Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
"
18 5 Cartman "It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
"
18 5 Cartman "Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
"
18 5 Cartman "Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
"
18 5 Cartman "This thing is recording, right?
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
"
18 5 Cartman "His dad sees you!
"
18 5 Cartman "Fly back to the house, stupid!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Not a word, Kenny!
"
18 5 Cartman "Hey you guys.
"
18 5 Cartman "You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
"
18 5 Cartman "Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
"
18 5 Cartman "You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
"
18 5 Cartman "Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
"
18 5 Cartman "I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
"
18 5 Cartman "Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters-
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
"
18 5 Cartman "Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
"
18 5 Cartman "What? 
"
18 5 Cartman "What does that have to do with me?
"
18 5 Cartman "Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
18 5 Cartman "You were what?!
"
18 5 Cartman "You were spying on me?!
"
18 5 Cartman "But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
18 5 Cartman "You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Because, Butters-
"
18 5 Cartman "Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
"
18 5 Cartman "Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh hey Butters. Sup?
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude, what's the matter?
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
"
18 5 Cartman "Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
"
18 5 Cartman "Your dad's drone.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
"
18 5 Cartman "It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
"
18 5 Cartman "You're welcome. 
"
18 6 Cartman "What are you two boners doing?
"
18 6 Cartman "I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
"
18 6 Cartman "How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
"
18 6 Cartman "Yes.
"
18 6 Cartman "Jimmy told me about this game.
"
18 6 Cartman "The?!
"
18 6 Cartman "Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
"
18 6 Cartman "It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
"
18 6 Cartman "How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
"
18 6 Cartman "And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
"
18 6 Cartman "That makes sense.
"
18 6 Cartman "It's done. 
"
18 6 Cartman "The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.
"
18 6 Cartman "Cool.
"
18 7 Cartman "That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
"
18 7 Cartman "What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
"
18 7 Cartman "You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
18 7 Cartman "You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
"
18 7 Cartman "You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
"
18 7 Cartman "Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
"
18 7 Cartman "Welcome back, dude.
"
18 7 Cartman "How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
"
18 7 Cartman "Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
"
18 7 Cartman "Thank you, Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
"
18 7 Cartman "Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
"
18 7 Cartman "See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
"
18 7 Cartman "Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
"
18 7 Cartman "Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
18 7 Cartman "Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
"
18 7 Cartman "All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
"
18 7 Cartman "Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
18 7 Cartman "You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
"
18 7 Cartman "Just take the money, Butters! 
"
18 7 Cartman "You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
"
18 7 Cartman "Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
"
18 7 Cartman "Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "Wait, hang on Butters!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters?? Butters?? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Are you okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm not here, Butters.
"
18 7 Cartman "This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
"
18 7 Cartman "You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
"
18 7 Cartman "How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
"
18 7 Cartman "With what?
"
18 7 Cartman "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Cartman "Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
"
18 7 Cartman "Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
"
18 7 Cartman "Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
"
18 7 Cartman "Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
"
18 7 Cartman "Are you fucking with me?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
"
18 7 Cartman "Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
"
18 7 Cartman "That's right!
"
18 7 Cartman "THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
"
18 7 Cartman "Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
"
18 7 Cartman "It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
"
18 7 Cartman "I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
"
18 7 Cartman "Mmmhmm.
"
18 7 Cartman "And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
"
18 7 Cartman "Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
"
18 7 Cartman "I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Calm down.
"
18 7 Cartman "In virtual reality, yes you did.
"
18 7 Cartman "You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Fuck!
"
18 7 Cartman "Or if I did?
"
18 7 Cartman "What?  Hello?
"
18 7 Cartman "Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
"
18 7 Cartman "No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
"
18 7 Cartman "Because... I'm a computer program.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
"
18 7 Cartman "You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
"
18 7 Cartman "Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
"
18 8 Cartman "What's this?
"
18 8 Cartman "Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
"
18 8 Cartman "This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
18 8 Cartman "He's playing an enchantment.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, it was complete brutality!
"
18 8 Cartman "At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
"
18 8 Cartman "Kewwwl!
"
18 8 Cartman "What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, do we look like police?
"
18 8 Cartman "Five darrar? 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, that was total carnage!
"
18 8 Cartman "Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
"
18 8 Cartman "We're going again on Friday, right?
"
18 8 Cartman "What's the matter Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "You feel bad for the roosters?
"
18 8 Cartman "Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
"
18 8 Cartman "Huh? A little bit?
"
18 8 Cartman "What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
"
18 8 Cartman "Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18 8 Cartman "Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
"
18 8 Cartman "Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?
"
18 8 Cartman """Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "All right McNuggets!
"
18 8 Cartman "That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
18 8 Cartman "Thank you so very much.
"
18 8 Cartman "You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
"
18 8 Cartman "We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
"
18 8 Cartman "Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
"
18 8 Cartman "OOHHH!! 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
"
18 8 Cartman "Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
"
18 8 Cartman "Ten darra?! 
"
18 8 Cartman "Who is that??
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
"
18 8 Cartman "McNuggets is scared, dude!
"
18 8 Cartman "This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
"
18 8 Cartman "Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
"
18 8 Cartman "Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
"
18 8 Cartman "Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
"
18 8 Cartman "Ah, dude, your dad's here.
"
18 8 Cartman "It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
"
18 8 Cartman "Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
"
18 10 Cartman "Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
"
18 10 Cartman "He's such a douchebag.
"
18 10 Cartman "Now we're talkin'! 
"
18 10 Cartman "Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
"
18 10 Cartman "No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
"
18 10 Cartman "I can hear you, douchebag.
"
18 10 Cartman "These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
"
18 10 Cartman "G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
"
18 10 Cartman "Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
"
18 10 Cartman "How do you even know I'm here in my room?
"
18 10 Cartman "...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Why does that matter?
"
18 10 Cartman "What?
"
18 10 Cartman "Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh, this should be good.
"
18 10 Cartman "I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
"
18 10 Cartman "Hoh, this should get some comments. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh bros, weak!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh weak, bros, so weak!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.
"
18 10 Cartman "CartmaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
"
18 10 Cartman "Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
"
18 10 Cartman "Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
"
18 10 Cartman "Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
"
18 10 Cartman "I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
"
18 10 Cartman "It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
"
18 10 Cartman "Hey! What's going on? What is that? 
"
18 10 Cartman "What the hell?!
"
18 10 Cartman "Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!

18 10 Cartman "Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
"
18 10 Cartman "Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
18 10 Cartman "No! You can't do this!
"
18 10 Cartman "God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
"
18 10 Cartman "NOOOO! 
"
18 9 Cartman "He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?

18 9 Cartman "Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 
"
18 9 Cartman "That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
18 9 Cartman "Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
18 9 Cartman "There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
"
18 9 Cartman "Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.

18 9 Cartman "More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
"
18 9 Cartman "That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
18 9 Cartman "Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
18 9 Cartman "God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 9 Cartman "Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
"
18 9 Cartman "I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
"
18 9 Cartman "Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
"
18 9 Cartman "That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 
"
18 9 Cartman "Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 9 Cartman "CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 9 Cartman "Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.

18 9 Cartman "Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
"
18 9 Cartman "Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!

"
18 9 Cartman "Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
"
18 9 Cartman "This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
"
18 9 Cartman "Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
"
18 9 Cartman "There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
"
18 9 Cartman "This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
"
18 9 Cartman "What the hell did I do?
"
18 9 Cartman "Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
"
18 9 Cartman "Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
"
18 9 Cartman "Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 9 Cartman "Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 1 Cartman "Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
"
18 1 Cartman "Protruding vaginal boner.
"
18 1 Cartman "Oh, I like that. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
"
18 1 Cartman "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
"
18 1 Cartman "You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
18 1 Cartman "Washington. Redskins. 
"
18 1 Cartman "It's sooo sweet!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
18 1 Cartman "Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
"
18 1 Cartman "Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
"
18 1 Cartman "We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
"
18 1 Cartman "I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!
"
18 1 Cartman "Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
"
18 1 Cartman "By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
"
18 1 Cartman "Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
"
18 1 Cartman "Yes, I know.
"
18 1 Cartman "Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
"
18 1 Cartman "Nice, I like that.
"
18 1 Cartman "Stop? But why?
"
18 1 Cartman "Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
"
18 1 Cartman "How is it offensive?
"
18 1 Cartman "Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
"
18 1 Cartman "Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
"
18 1 Cartman "Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
"
18 1 Cartman "NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
"
18 1 Cartman "It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
18 1 Cartman "Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
"
18 1 Cartman "Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
"
18 1 Cartman "Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! 
"
18 1 Cartman "Goooood morning, guys!
"
18 1 Cartman "We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
"
18 1 Cartman "What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
"
18 1 Cartman "What?!
"
18 1 Cartman "Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
"
18 1 Cartman "You song of a bitch!
"
18 1 Cartman "You broke Kickstarter!
"
18 1 Cartman "Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
"
18 1 Cartman "Well, somebody did!
"
18 1 Cartman "A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
"
18 1 Cartman "It is really sweet.
"
18 1 Cartman "Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
"
18 1 Cartman "You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
"
18 1 Cartman "I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
"
18 1 Cartman "Whoa, whoa! What?
"
18 1 Cartman "I guess we gotta go back to school. 
"
18 2 Cartman "How's it going, everybody?
"
18 2 Cartman "Hey dude. Sup? 
"
18 2 Cartman "What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
"
18 2 Cartman "Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
"
18 2 Cartman "Dude, people are pissed off at us.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
"
18 2 Cartman "You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
"
18 2 Cartman "Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
"
18 2 Cartman "Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
"
18 2 Cartman "What?
"
18 2 Cartman "We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
"
18 2 Cartman "Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
"
18 2 Cartman "So who do we throw the party for?
"
18 2 Cartman "You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
"
18 2 Cartman "You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"
18 2 Cartman """I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.""
"
18 2 Cartman "Believe it, dude.
"
18 2 Cartman "What the hell is gluten?
"
18 2 Cartman "KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
"
18 2 Cartman "What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
18 2 Cartman "You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
"
18 2 Cartman "There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
"
18 2 Cartman "Aunt Jemima. 
"
18 2 Cartman "I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
"
18 2 Cartman "I don't even know what that means.
"
18 2 Cartman "Are you going to eat those pancakes?
"
18 2 Cartman "Oooo, trippy...
"
18 2 Cartman "They've got what backward? 
"
18 2 Cartman "Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE!
"
18 2 Cartman "KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
"
18 2 Cartman "My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
"
18 2 Cartman "What, what is it? What is it for?
"
18 2 Cartman "It's upside down.
"
18 2 Cartman "Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
"
18 2 Cartman "Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
"
18 3 Cartman "Good for you. 
"
18 3 Cartman "No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
18 3 Cartman "I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
"
18 3 Cartman "Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
"
18 3 Cartman "Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
18 3 Cartman "I'm going to the potty.
"
18 3 Cartman "Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
"
18 3 Cartman "Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
18 3 Cartman "Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
"
18 3 Cartman "It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
"
18 3 Cartman "That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
"
18 3 Cartman "Erica.
"
18 3 Cartman "All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
"
18 3 Cartman "There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
"
18 3 Cartman "Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
"
18 3 Cartman "I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
"
18 3 Cartman "Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
"
18 3 Cartman "OH MY GOD!
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
18 3 Cartman "Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh on that side?
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
"
18 3 Cartman "It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
"
18 3 Cartman "Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" 
"
18 3 Cartman "Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
"
18 3 Cartman "I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
"
18 3 Cartman "Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
18 3 Cartman "Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
"
18 3 Cartman "No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
"
18 3 Cartman "Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
"
18 3 Cartman "Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
"
18 3 Cartman "Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
18 3 Cartman "Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
"
18 3 Cartman "He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
"
18 3 Cartman "At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
"
18 3 Cartman "Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
"
18 3 Cartman "I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
"
18 5 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
18 5 Cartman "That's stupid.
"
18 5 Cartman "I'm dying of boredom.
"
18 5 Cartman "What did you say?
"
18 5 Cartman "Your dad has a fucking drone?
"
18 5 Cartman "Whooaa! 
"
18 5 Cartman "You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
18 5 Cartman "Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, is that you?
"
18 5 Cartman "Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
"
18 5 Cartman "It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
"
18 5 Cartman "Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
"
18 5 Cartman "Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
"
18 5 Cartman "This thing is recording, right?
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
"
18 5 Cartman "His dad sees you!
"
18 5 Cartman "Fly back to the house, stupid!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
"
18 5 Cartman "Not a word, Kenny!
"
18 5 Cartman "Hey you guys.
"
18 5 Cartman "You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
"
18 5 Cartman "Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
"
18 5 Cartman "You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
"
18 5 Cartman "Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
"
18 5 Cartman "I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
"
18 5 Cartman "Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters-
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
"
18 5 Cartman "Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
"
18 5 Cartman "What? 
"
18 5 Cartman "What does that have to do with me?
"
18 5 Cartman "Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
18 5 Cartman "You were what?!
"
18 5 Cartman "You were spying on me?!
"
18 5 Cartman "But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
18 5 Cartman "You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Because, Butters-
"
18 5 Cartman "Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
"
18 5 Cartman "Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
"
18 5 Cartman "Oh hey Butters. Sup?
"
18 5 Cartman "Dude, what's the matter?
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
"
18 5 Cartman "Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
"
18 5 Cartman "Your dad's drone.
"
18 5 Cartman "Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
"
18 5 Cartman "It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
18 5 Cartman "Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""
"
18 5 Cartman "Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
"
18 5 Cartman "You're welcome. 
"
18 6 Cartman "What are you two boners doing?
"
18 6 Cartman "I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
"
18 6 Cartman "How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
"
18 6 Cartman "Yes.
"
18 6 Cartman "Jimmy told me about this game.
"
18 6 Cartman "The?!
"
18 6 Cartman "Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
"
18 6 Cartman "It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
"
18 6 Cartman "How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
"
18 6 Cartman "And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
"
18 6 Cartman "That makes sense.
"
18 6 Cartman "It's done. 
"
18 6 Cartman "The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.
"
18 6 Cartman "Cool.
"
18 7 Cartman "That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
"
18 7 Cartman "What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
"
18 7 Cartman "You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
18 7 Cartman "You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
"
18 7 Cartman "You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
"
18 7 Cartman "Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
"
18 7 Cartman "Welcome back, dude.
"
18 7 Cartman "How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
"
18 7 Cartman "Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
"
18 7 Cartman "Thank you, Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
"
18 7 Cartman "Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
"
18 7 Cartman "See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
"
18 7 Cartman "Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
"
18 7 Cartman "Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
18 7 Cartman "Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
"
18 7 Cartman "All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
"
18 7 Cartman "Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
18 7 Cartman "You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
"
18 7 Cartman "Just take the money, Butters! 
"
18 7 Cartman "You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
"
18 7 Cartman "Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
"
18 7 Cartman "Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "Wait, hang on Butters!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters?? Butters?? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Are you okay?
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm not here, Butters.
"
18 7 Cartman "This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
"
18 7 Cartman "Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
"
18 7 Cartman "You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
"
18 7 Cartman "How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
"
18 7 Cartman "With what?
"
18 7 Cartman "Fuck you!
"
18 7 Cartman "Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
"
18 7 Cartman "Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
"
18 7 Cartman "Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
"
18 7 Cartman "Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
"
18 7 Cartman "Are you fucking with me?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
18 7 Cartman "Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
"
18 7 Cartman "Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
"
18 7 Cartman "That's right!
"
18 7 Cartman "THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
"
18 7 Cartman "Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
"
18 7 Cartman "It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
"
18 7 Cartman "I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
"
18 7 Cartman "Okay Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
"
18 7 Cartman "Mmmhmm.
"
18 7 Cartman "And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
"
18 7 Cartman "Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
"
18 7 Cartman "I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
"
18 7 Cartman "Calm down.
"
18 7 Cartman "In virtual reality, yes you did.
"
18 7 Cartman "You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18 7 Cartman "Fuck!
"
18 7 Cartman "Or if I did?
"
18 7 Cartman "What?  Hello?
"
18 7 Cartman "Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
"
18 7 Cartman "No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
"
18 7 Cartman "Because... I'm a computer program.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
"
18 7 Cartman "I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
"
18 7 Cartman "You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
"
18 7 Cartman "Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
"
18 8 Cartman "What's this?
"
18 8 Cartman "Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
"
18 8 Cartman "This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
18 8 Cartman "He's playing an enchantment.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, it was complete brutality!
"
18 8 Cartman "At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
"
18 8 Cartman "Kewwwl!
"
18 8 Cartman "What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, do we look like police?
"
18 8 Cartman "Five darrar? 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, that was total carnage!
"
18 8 Cartman "Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
"
18 8 Cartman "We're going again on Friday, right?
"
18 8 Cartman "What's the matter Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "You feel bad for the roosters?
"
18 8 Cartman "Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
"
18 8 Cartman "Huh? A little bit?
"
18 8 Cartman "What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
"
18 8 Cartman "Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18 8 Cartman "Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
"
18 8 Cartman "Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?
"
18 8 Cartman """Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
"
18 8 Cartman "All right McNuggets!
"
18 8 Cartman "That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
18 8 Cartman "Thank you so very much.
"
18 8 Cartman "You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
"
18 8 Cartman "We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
"
18 8 Cartman "Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
"
18 8 Cartman "OOHHH!! 
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
"
18 8 Cartman "Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
"
18 8 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
"
18 8 Cartman "Ten darra?! 
"
18 8 Cartman "Who is that??
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
"
18 8 Cartman "McNuggets is scared, dude!
"
18 8 Cartman "This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
"
18 8 Cartman "Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
"
18 8 Cartman "Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
"
18 8 Cartman "Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
"
18 8 Cartman "Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
"
18 8 Cartman "Ah, dude, your dad's here.
"
18 8 Cartman "It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
"
18 8 Cartman "Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
"
18 10 Cartman "Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
"
18 10 Cartman "He's such a douchebag.
"
18 10 Cartman "Now we're talkin'! 
"
18 10 Cartman "Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
"
18 10 Cartman "No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
"
18 10 Cartman "I can hear you, douchebag.
"
18 10 Cartman "These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
"
18 10 Cartman "G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
"
18 10 Cartman "Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
"
18 10 Cartman "How do you even know I'm here in my room?
"
18 10 Cartman "...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Why does that matter?
"
18 10 Cartman "What?
"
18 10 Cartman "Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh, this should be good.
"
18 10 Cartman "I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
"
18 10 Cartman "Hoh, this should get some comments. 
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh bros, weak!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh weak, bros, so weak!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.
"
18 10 Cartman "CartmaanBrah!
"
18 10 Cartman "Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
"
18 10 Cartman "Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
"
18 10 Cartman "Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
"
18 10 Cartman "Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
"
18 10 Cartman "I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
"
18 10 Cartman "It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
"
18 10 Cartman "Hey! What's going on? What is that? 
"
18 10 Cartman "What the hell?!
"
18 10 Cartman "Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
"
18 10 Cartman "Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
"
18 10 Cartman "Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
18 10 Cartman "No! You can't do this!
"
18 10 Cartman "God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
"
18 10 Cartman "NOOOO! 
"
