3 1 Cartman "Okay.
"
3 1 Cartman "What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
3 1 Cartman "Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.

3 1 Cartman "Yeah, pretty much.

3 1 Cartman "The nightmare begins.

3 1 Cartman "Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
3 1 Cartman "Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
"
3 1 Cartman "Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
"
3 1 Cartman "Okay.  Kugheek! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
"
3 1 Cartman "I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
3 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
3 1 Cartman "Why?
"
3 1 Cartman "Eh-heheh!
"
3 1 Cartman "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
3 1 Cartman "Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
3 1 Cartman "I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!
"
3 1 Cartman "It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
3 1 Cartman "Respect my authoritah!
"
3 1 Cartman "Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!

3 1 Cartman "Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
"
3 1 Cartman "God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
"
3 1 Cartman "I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
"
3 1 Cartman "Food! I have to have food! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Chicken wings. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Medium spicy. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
"
3 2 Cartman "Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
3 2 Cartman "What the hell happened to him?
"
3 2 Cartman "I'm gonna be Jesus!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
3 2 Cartman "Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
"
3 2 Cartman "This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
"
3 2 Cartman "Peter!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Hi, mom. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
"
3 2 Cartman "Up your ass with broken glass!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "What?!

3 2 Cartman "You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.

3 2 Cartman "Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"
3 3 Cartman "Mom, please can we just leave?
"
3 3 Cartman "But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
"
3 3 Cartman "That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
"
3 3 Cartman "Weak. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
"
3 3 Cartman "God damn it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes.
"
3 3 Cartman "I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
3 3 Cartman "They look exactly the same.
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, two!
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, one.
"
3 3 Cartman "Two.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! I hate you!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.
"
3 3 Cartman "My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
3 3 Cartman "Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
"
3 3 Cartman "Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
"
3 3 Cartman "Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
3 3 Cartman "Bitch, I hate that bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Stop calling me piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "So, what does that mean?
"
3 3 Cartman "All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! Son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
"
3 3 Cartman "I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, yeah, sure sure.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey!
"
3 3 Cartman "Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, no!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
"
3 3 Cartman "But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! You son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
"
3 3 Cartman "That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Aaah! It's the succubus! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened?
"
3 3 Cartman "You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
"
3 3 Cartman "You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
"
3 3 Cartman "If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
"
3 3 Cartman "What what what?
"
3 3 Cartman "I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! 
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh no! The tape jammed! 
"
3 3 Cartman "I can't see anything!
"
3 3 Cartman "Got it! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
"
3 3 Cartman "After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
"
3 3 Cartman "No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
3 3 Cartman "Eh-sure.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooohh.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
"
3 4 Cartman "Told ya!
"
3 4 Cartman "I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
"
3 4 Cartman "You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'll bet.
"
3 4 Cartman "Five bucks.
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
"
3 4 Cartman "No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
"
3 4 Cartman "You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
"
3 4 Cartman "Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
"
3 4 Cartman "Those sons of bitches!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
"
3 4 Cartman "Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
"
3 4 Cartman "After Red Racer, of course.
"
3 4 Cartman "However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
"
3 4 Cartman "Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
"
3 4 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
"
3 4 Cartman "When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
"
3 4 Cartman "You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on!
"
3 4 Cartman "What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
"
3 4 Cartman "You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine, that's fine!
"
3 4 Cartman "I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Respect my authoritah! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
"
3 4 Cartman "I win!
"
3 4 Cartman "Hey, maybe.

3 4 Cartman "Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
"
3 5 Cartman "You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":

3 5 Cartman "God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
"
3 5 Cartman "Stop, you guys! I can't think!

"
3 5 Cartman "You mean the other jakovasaur?
"
3 5 Cartman "You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
"
3 5 Cartman "But the other jakovasaur talked different.
"
3 5 Cartman "I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
"
3 5 Cartman "He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
"
3 5 Cartman "Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!
"
3 5 Cartman "No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. 
"
3 5 Cartman "Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
"
3 5 Cartman "Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?

3 6 Cartman "Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes.

"
3 7 Cartman "I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
"
3 7 Cartman "God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
"
3 7 Cartman "Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.

3 7 Cartman "You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
"
3 7 Cartman "What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh! God damnit!
"
3 7 Cartman "Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
"
3 7 Cartman "You just want me to open the door!
"
3 7 Cartman "What?? Ih- is she okay?

3 7 Cartman "Huh?! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
"
3 7 Cartman "Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!

3 7 Cartman "O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH!

3 7 Cartman "Okay. See you in a while.
"
3 7 Cartman "Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
"
3 7 Cartman "No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
"
3 7 Cartman "Yuh, you mean it?
"
3 7 Cartman "Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
"
3 7 Cartman "Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
"
3 7 Cartman "That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
"
3 7 Cartman "Gotcha! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
"
3 7 Cartman "You're not ugly.
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
"
3 7 Cartman "Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
"
3 7 Cartman "If you want, I could help you.
"
3 7 Cartman "Just let me get my cowboy hat.
"
3 7 Cartman "Okay, it's clear. 
"
3 7 Cartman "We don't have much time!

3 7 Cartman "Hurry up in there!

3 7 Cartman "That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!

3 7 Cartman "Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.

"
3 13 Cartman "Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss! 
"
3 13 Cartman "Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
"
3 13 Cartman "Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. 
"
3 13 Cartman "I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
"
3 13 Cartman "Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
"
3 13 Cartman "Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
"
3 13 Cartman "That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
"
3 13 Cartman "No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
"
3 13 Cartman "You're damn straight, he did.
"
3 13 Cartman "Now you're gettin' it.
"
3 14 Cartman "Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
"
3 14 Cartman "I'm playing the drum.
"
3 14 Cartman "You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
"
3 14 Cartman "I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
"
3 14 Cartman "Ey, I'll get it!
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes I will!
"
3 14 Cartman "Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
"
3 14 Cartman "What?
"
3 14 Cartman "No way! Flutes are totally gay!
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3 14 Cartman "Later.
"
3 14 Cartman "Good morning, gentlemen.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
"
3 14 Cartman "Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes we are!
"
3 14 Cartman "Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Right.
"
3 14 Cartman "Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hooray for the South!
"
3 14 Cartman "But why? Why should they get the bell?
"
3 14 Cartman "But we don't have to lose.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
3 14 Cartman "God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
3 14 Cartman "So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
"
3 14 Cartman "I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Perhaps we should take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
"
3 14 Cartman "No. I say we take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
3 14 Cartman "Excuse meh.
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where did the Confederates go, son?
"
3 14 Cartman "Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where are you going?
"
3 14 Cartman "We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
3 14 Cartman "No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
"
3 14 Cartman "God, I hate you guys!
"
3 14 Cartman "This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
"
3 14 Cartman "Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes! Yes!
"
3 14 Cartman "Take the fort!
"
3 14 Cartman "Suck my ass!
"
3 14 Cartman "We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
"
3 14 Cartman "I knew they would!
"
3 14 Cartman "Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
"
3 14 Cartman "I don't. I made it up. 
"
3 14 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
3 14 Cartman "What?!
"
3 14 Cartman "No! We still have to fight!
"
3 14 Cartman "NOOO!!
"
3 14 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
"
3 14 Cartman "Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
3 14 Cartman "Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
"
3 14 Cartman "The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hahahaha haa ha!
"
3 15 Cartman "Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3 15 Cartman "Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

"
3 15 Cartman "Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
"
3 16 Cartman "You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
"
3 16 Cartman "I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
"
3 16 Cartman "Yes! I really did.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
"
3 16 Cartman "My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
"
3 16 Cartman "You did?
"
3 16 Cartman "Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
"
3 16 Cartman "Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
"
3 16 Cartman "Tampon? What's a tampon?
"
3 16 Cartman "Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
3 16 Cartman "All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
"
3 16 Cartman "And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
"
3 16 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle?
"
3 16 Cartman "...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
"
3 16 Cartman "Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
"
3 16 Cartman "Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
"
3 16 Cartman "Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
"
3 17 Cartman "Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That was pretty cool.
"
3 17 Cartman "Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "No? How about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
3 17 Cartman "That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
"
3 17 Cartman "Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
"
3 17 Cartman "How about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
"
3 17 Cartman "Stan, what's a queef?
"
3 17 Cartman "Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
"
3 17 Cartman "Aaaa-
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""
"
3 17 Cartman """An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?
"
3 17 Cartman "How about geebo, or, or mung?
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
"
3 17 Cartman "You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
"
3 17 Cartman "Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
"
3 17 Cartman "Ooooh.
"
3 17 Cartman "They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
"
3 17 Cartman "Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
"
3 17 Cartman "Uh-oh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
"
3 1 Cartman "Okay.
"
3 1 Cartman "What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
3 1 Cartman "Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
"
3 1 Cartman "Whoopee.
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah, pretty much.
"
3 1 Cartman "The nightmare begins.
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
3 1 Cartman "Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
"
3 1 Cartman "Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
"
3 1 Cartman "Okay.  Kugheek! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
"
3 1 Cartman "I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
3 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
3 1 Cartman "Why?
"
3 1 Cartman "Eh-heheh!
"
3 1 Cartman "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
3 1 Cartman "Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
3 1 Cartman "I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!
"
3 1 Cartman "It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
3 1 Cartman "Respect my authoritah!
"
3 1 Cartman "Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
"
3 1 Cartman "He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
"
3 1 Cartman "Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Y taco.
"
3 1 Cartman "Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
"
3 1 Cartman "This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
"
3 1 Cartman "I'm going this way!
"
3 1 Cartman "Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
"
3 1 Cartman "God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
"
3 1 Cartman "I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
"
3 1 Cartman "Food! I have to have food! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Chicken wings. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Medium spicy. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
"
3 2 Cartman "Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
3 2 Cartman "What the hell happened to him?
"
3 2 Cartman "I'm gonna be Jesus!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
3 2 Cartman "Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
"
3 2 Cartman "This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
"
3 2 Cartman "Peter!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Hi, mom. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
"
3 2 Cartman "Up your ass with broken glass!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "What?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, there you guys are!
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
"
3 2 Cartman "...Really?
"
3 2 Cartman "...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "Officer Barbrady! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stand and Kyle"" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...

3 2 Cartman "Hey you guys. Seriously.

3 2 Cartman "Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
"
3 2 Cartman "Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!

3 2 Cartman "Oh, damnit!

3 2 Cartman "Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.

3 2 Cartman "Get me down from here!

3 2 Cartman "Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"
3 3 Cartman "Mom, please can we just leave?
"
3 3 Cartman "But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
"
3 3 Cartman "That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
"
3 3 Cartman "Weak. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
"
3 3 Cartman "God damn it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes.
"
3 3 Cartman "I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
3 3 Cartman "They look exactly the same.
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, two!
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, one.
"
3 3 Cartman "Two.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! I hate you!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.
"
3 3 Cartman "My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
3 3 Cartman "Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
"
3 3 Cartman "Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
"
3 3 Cartman "Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
3 3 Cartman "Bitch, I hate that bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Stop calling me piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "So, what does that mean?
"
3 3 Cartman "All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! Son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!

3 3 Cartman "I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, yeah, sure sure.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey!
"
3 3 Cartman "Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, no!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
"
3 3 Cartman "But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! You son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
"
3 3 Cartman "That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Aaah! It's the succubus! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened?
"
3 3 Cartman "You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
"
3 3 Cartman "You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
"
3 3 Cartman "If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
"
3 3 Cartman "What what what?
"
3 3 Cartman "I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! 
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh no! The tape jammed! 
"
3 3 Cartman "I can't see anything!
"
3 3 Cartman "Got it! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
"
3 3 Cartman "After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
"
3 3 Cartman "No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
3 3 Cartman "Eh-sure.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooohh.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
"
3 4 Cartman "Told ya!
"
3 4 Cartman "I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
"
3 4 Cartman "You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'll bet.
"
3 4 Cartman "Five bucks.
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
"
3 4 Cartman "No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
"
3 4 Cartman "You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
"
3 4 Cartman "Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
"
3 4 Cartman "Those sons of bitches!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
"
3 4 Cartman "Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
"
3 4 Cartman "After Red Racer, of course.
"
3 4 Cartman "However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
"
3 4 Cartman "Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
"
3 4 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
"
3 4 Cartman "When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
"
3 4 Cartman "You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on!
"
3 4 Cartman "What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
"
3 4 Cartman "You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine, that's fine!
"
3 4 Cartman "I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Respect my authoritah! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude. Come on, now. Come on.

3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
"

3 5 Cartman "He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left.

"
3 7 Cartman "God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
"
3 7 Cartman "Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.

3 7 Cartman "Aaaaa!  Yes!

3 7 Cartman "You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
"
3 7 Cartman "What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh! God damnit!
"
3 7 Cartman "Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!

"
3 7 Cartman "Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!

"
3 7 Cartman "Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
"
3 7 Cartman "No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
"
3 7 Cartman "Yuh, you mean it?
"
3 7 Cartman "Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.

3 7 Cartman "Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
"
3 7 Cartman "That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
"
3 7 Cartman "Gotcha! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
"
3 7 Cartman "You're not ugly.
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
"
3 7 Cartman "Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
"
3 7 Cartman "If you want, I could help you.
"
3 7 Cartman "Just let me get my cowboy hat.
"
3 7 Cartman "Okay, it's clear. 
"
3 7 Cartman "We don't have much time!
"
3 7 Cartman "Hurry up in there!
"
3 7 Cartman "That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh my God!

3 14 Cartman "Good morning, gentlemen.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
"
3 14 Cartman "Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes we are!
"
3 14 Cartman "Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Right.
"
3 14 Cartman "Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hooray for the South!
"
3 14 Cartman "But why? Why should they get the bell?
"
3 14 Cartman "But we don't have to lose.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
3 14 Cartman "God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
3 14 Cartman "So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
"
3 14 Cartman "I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Perhaps we should take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
"
3 14 Cartman "No. I say we take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
3 14 Cartman "Excuse meh.
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where did the Confederates go, son?
"
3 14 Cartman "Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where are you going?
"
3 14 Cartman "We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
3 14 Cartman "No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
"
3 14 Cartman "God, I hate you guys!
"
3 14 Cartman "This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
"
3 14 Cartman "Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes! Yes!
"
3 14 Cartman "Take the fort!
"
3 14 Cartman "Suck my ass!
"
3 14 Cartman "We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
"
3 14 Cartman "I knew they would!
"
3 14 Cartman "Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
"
3 14 Cartman "I don't. I made it up. 
"
3 14 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
3 14 Cartman "What?!
"
3 14 Cartman "No! We still have to fight!
"
3 14 Cartman "NOOO!!
"
3 14 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
"
3 14 Cartman "Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
3 14 Cartman "Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
"
3 14 Cartman "The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hahahaha haa ha!
"
3 15 Cartman "Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3 15 Cartman "Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.

"
3 15 Cartman "Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
"
3 16 Cartman "You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
"
3 16 Cartman "I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
"
3 16 Cartman "Yes! I really did.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
"
3 16 Cartman "My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
"
3 16 Cartman "You did?
"
3 16 Cartman "Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
"
3 16 Cartman "Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
"
3 16 Cartman "Tampon? What's a tampon?
"
3 16 Cartman "Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
3 16 Cartman "All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
"
3 16 Cartman "And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
"
3 16 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle?
"
3 16 Cartman "...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
"
3 16 Cartman "Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
"
3 16 Cartman "Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
"
3 16 Cartman "Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
"
3 17 Cartman "Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That was pretty cool.
"
3 17 Cartman "Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "No? How about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
3 17 Cartman "That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
"
3 17 Cartman "Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
"
3 17 Cartman "How about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
"
3 17 Cartman "Stan, what's a queef?
"
3 17 Cartman "Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
"
3 17 Cartman "Aaaa-
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""
"
3 17 Cartman """An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?
"
3 17 Cartman "How about geebo, or, or mung?
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
"
3 17 Cartman "You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
"
3 17 Cartman "Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
"
3 17 Cartman "Ooooh.
"
3 17 Cartman "They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
"
3 17 Cartman "Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
"
3 17 Cartman "Uh-oh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
"
3 1 Cartman "Okay.
"
3 1 Cartman "What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
3 1 Cartman "Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
"
3 1 Cartman "Whoopee.
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah, pretty much.
"
3 1 Cartman "The nightmare begins.
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
"
3 1 Cartman "Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
3 1 Cartman "Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
"
3 1 Cartman "Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
"
3 1 Cartman "Okay.  Kugheek! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
"
3 1 Cartman "I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
3 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
3 1 Cartman "Why?
"
3 1 Cartman "Eh-heheh!
"
3 1 Cartman "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
3 1 Cartman "Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
3 1 Cartman "I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!
"
3 1 Cartman "It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
3 1 Cartman "Respect my authoritah!
"
3 1 Cartman "Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
"
3 1 Cartman "He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
"
3 1 Cartman "Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
"
3 1 Cartman "Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Y taco.
"
3 1 Cartman "Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
"
3 1 Cartman "This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
"
3 1 Cartman "I'm going this way!
"
3 1 Cartman "Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
"
3 1 Cartman "God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
"
3 1 Cartman "I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
"
3 1 Cartman "Food! I have to have food! 
"
3 1 Cartman "Chicken wings. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Medium spicy. 
"
3 1 Cartman "Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
"
3 2 Cartman "Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
3 2 Cartman "What the hell happened to him?
"
3 2 Cartman "I'm gonna be Jesus!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
3 2 Cartman "Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
"
3 2 Cartman "This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
"
3 2 Cartman "Peter!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Hi, mom. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
"
3 2 Cartman "Up your ass with broken glass!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Well, get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "What?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey, there you guys are!
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
"
3 2 Cartman "...Really?
"
3 2 Cartman "...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "Officer Barbrady! 
"
3 2 Cartman "Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
"
3 2 Cartman "You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stand and Kyle"" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey you guys. Seriously. 
"
3 2 Cartman "Chef! Chef!
"
3 2 Cartman "Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
"
3 2 Cartman "Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
"
3 2 Cartman "What?
"
3 2 Cartman "What?!
"
3 2 Cartman "Oh, damnit!
"
3 2 Cartman "Hello-o.
"
3 2 Cartman "Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
"
3 2 Cartman "Get me down from here!
"
3 2 Cartman "Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"
3 3 Cartman "Mom, please can we just leave?
"
3 3 Cartman "But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
"
3 3 Cartman "That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
"
3 3 Cartman "Weak. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
"
3 3 Cartman "God damn it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes.
"
3 3 Cartman "I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
3 3 Cartman "They look exactly the same.
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, two!
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, one.
"
3 3 Cartman "Two.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! I hate you!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.
"
3 3 Cartman "My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
3 3 Cartman "Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
"
3 3 Cartman "Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
"
3 3 Cartman "Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
"
3 3 Cartman "I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow!
"
3 3 Cartman "My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
"
3 3 Cartman "Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
3 3 Cartman "Bitch, I hate that bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Stop calling me piggy!
"
3 3 Cartman "So, what does that mean?
"
3 3 Cartman "All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
"
3 3 Cartman "I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! Son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
"
3 3 Cartman "I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
"
3 3 Cartman "Uh, yeah, sure sure.
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey!
"
3 3 Cartman "Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, no!
"
3 3 Cartman "Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
"
3 3 Cartman "But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
"
3 3 Cartman "Hey! You son of a bitch!
"
3 3 Cartman "Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
"
3 3 Cartman "That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Aaah! It's the succubus! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened?
"
3 3 Cartman "You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
"
3 3 Cartman "You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
"
3 3 Cartman "If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
"
3 3 Cartman "What what what?
"
3 3 Cartman "I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
"
3 3 Cartman "Okay. 
"
3 3 Cartman "Ow! 
"
3 3 Cartman "Oh no! The tape jammed! 
"
3 3 Cartman "I can't see anything!
"
3 3 Cartman "Got it! 
"
3 3 Cartman "What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
"
3 3 Cartman "After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
"
3 3 Cartman "No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
3 3 Cartman "Eh-sure.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooohh.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
"
3 4 Cartman "Told ya!
"
3 4 Cartman "I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
"
3 4 Cartman "You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'll bet.
"
3 4 Cartman "Five bucks.
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
"
3 4 Cartman "No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
"
3 4 Cartman "You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
"
3 4 Cartman "Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
"
3 4 Cartman "Those sons of bitches!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
"
3 4 Cartman "Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
"
3 4 Cartman "Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
"
3 4 Cartman "After Red Racer, of course.
"
3 4 Cartman "However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
"
3 4 Cartman "Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
"
3 4 Cartman "Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
"
3 4 Cartman "When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
"
3 4 Cartman "Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
"
3 4 Cartman "You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on!
"
3 4 Cartman "What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
"
3 4 Cartman "You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
"
3 4 Cartman "I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
3 4 Cartman "Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Fine, that's fine!
"
3 4 Cartman "I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
"
3 4 Cartman "Respect my authoritah! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
"
3 4 Cartman "I win!
"
3 4 Cartman "Hey, maybe. 
"
3 4 Cartman "The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
"
3 4 Cartman "Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
"
3 4 Cartman "Come on, Craig!
"
3 4 Cartman "'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
"
3 4 Cartman "Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
"
3 4 Cartman "Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
"
3 4 Cartman "Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
"
3 5 Cartman "You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.

"
3 7 Cartman "God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.

"
3 7 Cartman "What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh! God damnit!

"
3 7 Cartman "Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!

"
3 7 Cartman "Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
"
3 7 Cartman "No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
"
3 7 Cartman "Yuh, you mean it?
"
3 7 Cartman "Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.

3 7 Cartman "Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
"
3 7 Cartman "That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
"
3 7 Cartman "I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
"
3 7 Cartman "Gotcha! 
"
3 7 Cartman "Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
"
3 7 Cartman "You're not ugly.
"
3 7 Cartman "Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
"
3 7 Cartman "Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
"
3 7 Cartman "If you want, I could help you.
"
3 7 Cartman "Just let me get my cowboy hat.
"
3 7 Cartman "Okay, it's clear. 
"
3 7 Cartman "We don't have much time!

3 7 Cartman "Hurry up in there!

3 7 Cartman "That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!

3 11 Cartman "Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
"
3 11 Cartman "She bought it.
"
3 11 Cartman "Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
"
3 11 Cartman "Alright,
"
3 11 Cartman "Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
"
3 11 Cartman "What? We're not gonna come visit him.
"
3 11 Cartman "T'heh, whatever. 
"
3 12 Cartman "Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
"
3 12 Cartman "That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
"
3 12 Cartman "—Christmastime is presents for me.

"
3 12 Cartman "You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
"
3 12 Cartman "We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
"
3 12 Cartman "Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...

3 12 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.

3 12 Cartman "I can't go with you guys right now.

3 12 Cartman "Mom, seriously!

3 12 Cartman "God-damnit, mom!
"
3 12 Cartman "God, I hate you guys!
"
3 12 Cartman "How?
"
3 12 Cartman "Spooky spider?
"
3 12 Cartman "You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
"
3 12 Cartman "So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
"
3 12 Cartman "U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
"
3 12 Cartman "This is gonna be fun!
"
3 12 Cartman "Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.
"
3 12 Cartman """Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!""  Ow.
"
3 12 Cartman "Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""...
"
3 12 Cartman "Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
"
3 12 Cartman "Heh heh, I'm sweet.
"
3 12 Cartman "Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
"
3 12 Cartman "We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!""
"
3 12 Cartman "It wasn't me! 
"
3 12 Cartman "Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
"
3 12 Cartman "A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
"
3 12 Cartman "I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 
"
3 12 Cartman "Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
"
3 12 Cartman "Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"" 
"
3 12 Cartman "U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
"
3 12 Cartman "Uuh, problem, guys.
"
3 12 Cartman "Nno Grandma.
"
3 12 Cartman "Nno Grandma.
"
3 12 Cartman "Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
"
3 12 Cartman "How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
"
3 12 Cartman "Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
"
3 12 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
3 12 Cartman "That didn't help at all.
"
3 12 Cartman "Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
"
3 13 Cartman "A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
"
3 13 Cartman "Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.

3 13 Cartman "Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth.

3 13 Cartman "Oh, yes. We must do it again.
"
3 13 Cartman "How come you don't go to school?
"
3 13 Cartman "You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
"
3 13 Cartman "Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?
"
3 13 Cartman "You shut up,  butthole.

3 13 Cartman "You shut up,  ass-logger!

3 13 Cartman "That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
"
3 13 Cartman "I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 
"
3 13 Cartman "Eeehhh.

3 13 Cartman "I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
"
3 13 Cartman "Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
"
3 13 Cartman "Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
"
3 13 Cartman "That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
"
3 13 Cartman "No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
"
3 13 Cartman "You're damn straight, he did.
"
3 13 Cartman "Now you're gettin' it.
"
3 14 Cartman "Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
"
3 14 Cartman "I'm playing the drum.
"
3 14 Cartman "You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
"
3 14 Cartman "I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
"
3 14 Cartman "Ey, I'll get it!
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes I will!
"
3 14 Cartman "Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
"
3 14 Cartman "What?
"
3 14 Cartman "No way! Flutes are totally gay!
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3 14 Cartman "Later.
"
3 14 Cartman "Good morning, gentlemen.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
"
3 14 Cartman "Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes we are!
"
3 14 Cartman "Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Right.
"
3 14 Cartman "Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hooray for the South!
"
3 14 Cartman "But why? Why should they get the bell?
"
3 14 Cartman "But we don't have to lose.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
3 14 Cartman "God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
3 14 Cartman "So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
"
3 14 Cartman "I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
"
3 14 Cartman "Perhaps we should take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
"
3 14 Cartman "No. I say we take Topeka.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't.
"
3 14 Cartman "I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
3 14 Cartman "Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
3 14 Cartman "Excuse meh.
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where did the Confederates go, son?
"
3 14 Cartman "Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
"
3 14 Cartman "Where are you going?
"
3 14 Cartman "We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
3 14 Cartman "No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
"
3 14 Cartman "God, I hate you guys!
"
3 14 Cartman "This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
"
3 14 Cartman "Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
"
3 14 Cartman "Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
3 14 Cartman "Yes! Yes!
"
3 14 Cartman "Take the fort!
"
3 14 Cartman "Suck my ass!
"
3 14 Cartman "We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
"
3 14 Cartman "I knew they would!
"
3 14 Cartman "Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
"
3 14 Cartman "Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
"
3 14 Cartman "I don't. I made it up. 
"
3 14 Cartman "What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
3 14 Cartman "What?!
"
3 14 Cartman "No! We still have to fight!
"
3 14 Cartman "NOOO!!
"
3 14 Cartman "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
"
3 14 Cartman "Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
3 14 Cartman "Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
"
3 14 Cartman "The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
"
3 14 Cartman "Hahahaha haa ha!
"
3 15 Cartman "Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3 15 Cartman "Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

"
3 15 Cartman "Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
"
3 16 Cartman "You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
"
3 16 Cartman "I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
"
3 16 Cartman "Yes! I really did.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
"
3 16 Cartman "My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
"
3 16 Cartman "You did?
"
3 16 Cartman "Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
"
3 16 Cartman "Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
"
3 16 Cartman "Tampon? What's a tampon?
"
3 16 Cartman "Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
3 16 Cartman "All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
"
3 16 Cartman "And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
"
3 16 Cartman "Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
"
3 16 Cartman "What's the matter, Kyle?
"
3 16 Cartman "...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
"
3 16 Cartman "Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
"
3 16 Cartman "Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
"
3 16 Cartman "Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
"
3 16 Cartman "Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
"
3 16 Cartman "Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
"
3 16 Cartman "Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
"
3 16 Cartman "Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
"
3 16 Cartman "Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
"
3 17 Cartman "Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "That was pretty cool.
"
3 17 Cartman "Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "No? How about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
"
3 17 Cartman "We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
3 17 Cartman "That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
"
3 17 Cartman "Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
"
3 17 Cartman "How about this one, Kenny? 
"
3 17 Cartman "That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
"
3 17 Cartman "Stan, what's a queef?
"
3 17 Cartman "Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
"
3 17 Cartman "Aaaa-
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""
"
3 17 Cartman """An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?
"
3 17 Cartman "How about geebo, or, or mung?
"
3 17 Cartman "Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
"
3 17 Cartman "You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
"
3 17 Cartman "Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
"
3 17 Cartman "I told you guys!
"
3 17 Cartman "That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
"
3 17 Cartman "Ooooh.
"
3 17 Cartman "They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
"
3 17 Cartman "Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
"
3 17 Cartman "Uh-oh. 
"
3 17 Cartman "Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
"
