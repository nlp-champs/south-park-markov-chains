"
16 2 Kenny "(Fuck yeah!)
"
16 3 Kenny "(Totally!)
"
16 3 Kenny "(Yeah, dude!)
"
16 3 Kenny "(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 
"
16 3 Kenny "(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"
16 3 Kenny "(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
"
16 3 Kenny "(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
"
16 3 Kenny "(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
"
16 3 Kenny "(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
"
16 4 Kenny "(Me, too.)
"
16 6 Kenny "(What?!)
"
16 6 Kenny "(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
"
16 6 Kenny "(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
"
16 6 Kenny "(I can't take it!)
"
16 6 Kenny "I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
"
16 6 Kenny "Beavers! 
"
16 6 Kenny "Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.
"
16 7 Kenny "(Yeah, what's her name?)
"
16 11 Kenny "(I'm not his best friend.)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Butters, come on.)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Me?)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 
"
16 11 Kenny "My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
"
16 11 Kenny "To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
"
16 11 Kenny "(What about me?)
"
16 11 Kenny "(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
"
16 11 Kenny "(Whoops!)
"
16 11 Kenny "My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
"
16 11 Kenny "The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
"
16 11 Kenny "With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
"
16 11 Kenny "(You do?)
"
16 12 Kenny "(Yeah.)
"
16 12 Kenny "What's going on, Kyle?
"
16 12 Kenny "Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
"
16 12 Kenny "Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! 
"
16 12 Kenny "Yes. We saw their faces.
"
16 12 Kenny "Yeah, Stan?
"
16 13 Kenny "(I told you it was a bad idea.)
"
16 14 Kenny "(At Red Lobster.)
"
16 14 Kenny "(Red Lobster!)
