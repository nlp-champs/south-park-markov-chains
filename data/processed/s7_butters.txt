7 2 Butters "Hey Jimmy.
"
7 2 Butters "Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
"
7 2 Butters "You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
"
7 2 Butters "Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
"
7 2 Butters "Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
"
7 3 Butters "I love our class!
"
7 3 Butters "Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
"
7 3 Butters "I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
"
7 3 Butters "Ha-ey fellas. 
"
7 3 Butters "Hey fellas!
"
7 3 Butters "Yep. I'm in jail.
"
7 3 Butters "Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
"
7 3 Butters "Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
"
7 3 Butters "Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
"
7 3 Butters "You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
"
7 3 Butters "Hi, Dad.
"
7 3 Butters "Yeah.
"
7 3 Butters "Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.

Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
"
7 11 Butters "You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
"
7 11 Butters "HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?

7 11 Butters "You're not a cannibal, are you?
"
7 11 Butters "Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
"
7 11 Butters "I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
"
7 11 Butters "Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
"
7 11 Butters "Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?

"
7 14 Butters "This place is awesome!
"
7 14 Butters "Whoa!
"
7 14 Butters "W-we are.
"
7 14 Butters "You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
"
7 14 Butters "Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
"
7 14 Butters "When do you wanna see me?
"
7 14 Butters "Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
"
7 14 Butters "Waa... ahaaah... 
"
7 14 Butters "She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
"
7 14 Butters "Lexus! 
"
7 14 Butters "I waited all night for you to get off work.
"
7 14 Butters "I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
"
7 14 Butters "It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
"
7 14 Butters "Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
"
7 14 Butters "O-kay!
"
7 14 Butters "Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.
"
7 14 Butters "Hi! Is Lexus here?
"
7 14 Butters "Darling!
"
7 14 Butters "Oh God. I missed you so much.
"
7 14 Butters "Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
"
7 14 Butters "Hey Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Wuh it's me, Butters.
"
7 14 Butters "I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
"
7 14 Butters "Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
"
7 14 Butters "Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
"
7 14 Butters "Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
"
7 14 Butters "Uh but I spent it all.
"
7 14 Butters "On my girlfriend.
"
7 14 Butters "Yeah.
"
7 14 Butters "Yup!
"
7 14 Butters "Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
"
7 14 Butters "Okay. 
"
7 14 Butters "Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
"
7 14 Butters "Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
"
7 14 Butters "Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
"
7 14 Butters "Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Huh?
"
7 14 Butters "Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
"
7 14 Butters "... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
"
7 14 Butters "So that's it? We're broken up now?
"
7 14 Butters "Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
"
7 14 Butters "Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
"
7 14 Butters "Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"
7 14 Butters "Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
"
7 14 Butters "Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
"
7 14 Butters "Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
"
7 2 Butters "Hey Jimmy.

And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
"
7 11 Butters "Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
"
7 11 Butters "Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
"
7 12 Butters "He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
"
7 12 Butters "Let him have it, Stan!
"
7 14 Butters "Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
"
7 14 Butters "We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
"
7 14 Butters "Well what do we do now?
"
7 14 Butters "What's Raisins?
"
7 14 Butters "This place is awesome!
"
7 14 Butters "Whoa!
"
7 14 Butters "W-we are.
"
7 14 Butters "You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
"
7 14 Butters "Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
"
7 14 Butters "When do you wanna see me?
"
7 14 Butters "Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
"
7 14 Butters "Waa... ahaaah... 
"
7 14 Butters "She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
"
7 14 Butters "Lexus! 
"
7 14 Butters "I waited all night for you to get off work.
"
7 14 Butters "I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
"
7 14 Butters "It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
"
7 14 Butters "Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
"
7 14 Butters "O-kay!
"
7 14 Butters "Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.
"
7 14 Butters "Hi! Is Lexus here?
"
7 14 Butters "Darling!
"
7 14 Butters "Oh God. I missed you so much.
"
7 14 Butters "Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
"
7 14 Butters "Hey Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Wuh it's me, Butters.
"
7 14 Butters "I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
"
7 14 Butters "Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
"
7 14 Butters "Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
"
7 14 Butters "Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
"
7 14 Butters "Uh but I spent it all.
"
7 14 Butters "On my girlfriend.
"
7 14 Butters "Yeah.
"
7 14 Butters "Yup!
"
7 14 Butters "Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
"
7 14 Butters "Okay. 
"
7 14 Butters "Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
"
7 14 Butters "Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
"
7 14 Butters "Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
"
7 14 Butters "Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
"
7 14 Butters "Huh?
"
7 14 Butters "Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
"
7 14 Butters "... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
"
7 14 Butters "So that's it? We're broken up now?
"
7 14 Butters "Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"
7 14 Butters "Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
"
7 14 Butters "Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
"
7 14 Butters "Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"
7 14 Butters "Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
"
7 14 Butters "Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
"
7 14 Butters "Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.
