1 1 Kyle "Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, what?
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
1 1 Kyle "Kick the baby. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
1 1 Kyle "Totally!
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, fat boy saw it!
"
1 1 Kyle "What's an anal probe?
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
"
1 1 Kyle "Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "No, Ike, go home.
"
1 1 Kyle "This is it. This one's for the game.
"
1 1 Kyle "Kick the baby! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Damn it, he's still there.
"
1 1 Kyle "No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike! Go home!
"
1 1 Kyle "Oh, my God! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
"
1 1 Kyle "But I have to get off!
"
1 1 Kyle "No.
"
1 1 Kyle "But I...
"
1 1 Kyle "Arrghh!
"
1 1 Kyle "I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
"
1 1 Kyle "What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?""
"
1 1 Kyle """You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?""
"
1 1 Kyle "Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
"
1 1 Kyle "No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
"
1 1 Kyle "I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
"
1 1 Kyle "Damn it!
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude!
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, he's farting fire!
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, what does the note say?
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
"
1 1 Kyle "Bad.
"
1 1 Kyle "Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
"
1 1 Kyle "No!
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
"
1 1 Kyle "That was cool!
"
1 1 Kyle "Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
"
1 1 Kyle "Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
"
1 1 Kyle "He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey!
"
1 1 Kyle "If you visitors can hear me- 
"
1 1 Kyle "-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
"
1 1 Kyle "Give me back my brother! 
"
1 1 Kyle "You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
"
1 1 Kyle "Now do you believe us, Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "Cartman, they killed Kenny!
"
1 1 Kyle "He's dead, Cartman! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
"
1 1 Kyle "You're all I have left, Stan.
"
1 1 Kyle "You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Rats.
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
"
1 1 Kyle "You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
"
1 1 Kyle "Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
"
1 1 Kyle "Just make sweet love down by the fire.
"
1 1 Kyle "...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
"
1 1 Kyle "Why?
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
"
1 1 Kyle "How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
"
1 1 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
1 1 Kyle "Fart, damn you!
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa, look at that.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
"
1 1 Kyle "Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
"
1 1 Kyle "Did it work?
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
"
1 1 Kyle "You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeh, we're running out of friends.
"
1 1 Kyle "Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
"
1 1 Kyle "Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
"
1 2 Kyle "Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
"
1 2 Kyle "Nobody hates rainbows.
"
1 2 Kyle "Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
"
1 2 Kyle "No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
"
1 2 Kyle "Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
"
1 2 Kyle "What was your paper about Wendy?
"
1 2 Kyle "Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
"
1 2 Kyle "Wow, are you gonna do it?
"
1 2 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
"
1 2 Kyle "Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Bulk up to what, fatass?
"
1 2 Kyle "Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
"
1 2 Kyle "You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
"
1 2 Kyle "Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!""
"
1 2 Kyle "I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
"
1 2 Kyle "Stop who?
"
1 2 Kyle "Uh oh, we're losing him. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
"
1 2 Kyle "Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
"
1 3 Kyle "Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
"
1 3 Kyle "Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
"
1 3 Kyle "I like chocolate milk.
"
1 3 Kyle "Wow, that'd be cool.
"
1 3 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
1 3 Kyle "I guess so.
"
1 3 Kyle "What?!
"
1 3 Kyle "Shoot it Stan.
"
1 3 Kyle "Hey, what's that?
"
1 3 Kyle "You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
"
1 3 Kyle "No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
"
1 3 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
"
1 3 Kyle "Deformed how?
"
1 3 Kyle "A knife.
"
1 3 Kyle "Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
"
1 3 Kyle "Yeah, give me that flashlight. 
"
1 3 Kyle "What is that?
"
1 3 Kyle "Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
"
1 3 Kyle "Stan, Stan, wake up!
"
1 3 Kyle "I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
"
1 3 Kyle "They're out fishing with Kenny.
"
1 3 Kyle "Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
"
1 3 Kyle "Look!
"
1 3 Kyle "Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
"
1 3 Kyle "Look, up there.
"
1 3 Kyle "Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
"
1 3 Kyle "Whoa!
"
1 3 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1 3 Kyle "Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
1 3 Kyle "Aaaaah! 
"
1 3 Kyle "Hey look, Kenny's okay.
"
1 3 Kyle "Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
"
1 3 Kyle "Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
"
1 4 Kyle "Who's that?
"
1 4 Kyle "Wow! Cool!
"
1 4 Kyle "You're on, dude. 
"
1 4 Kyle "I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
"
1 4 Kyle "Who's Middle Park?
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
"
1 4 Kyle "You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
"
1 4 Kyle "Did it work?
"
1 4 Kyle "Oolala 
"
1 4 Kyle "Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
"
1 4 Kyle "Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
"
1 4 Kyle "What'd he say?
"
1 4 Kyle "Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
"
1 4 Kyle "Uh, Chef?
"
1 4 Kyle "Chef.
"
1 4 Kyle "Chef!
"
1 4 Kyle "What's the matter dude?
"
1 4 Kyle "Wow, it's been like two days.
"
1 4 Kyle "We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
"
1 4 Kyle "You what?!
"
1 4 Kyle "But I never practiced quarterback.
"
1 4 Kyle "Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
"
1 4 Kyle "Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!
"
1 4 Kyle "Cartman farted!
"
1 4 Kyle "No way dude!
"
1 4 Kyle "Ah, dude, weak.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hut.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hut, hut. 
"
1 4 Kyle "Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
"
1 4 Kyle "Hike!
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.
"
1 4 Kyle "Oof. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
"
1 5 Kyle "You mean this one?
"
1 5 Kyle "He's my new pet elephant.
"
1 5 Kyle "I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
"
1 5 Kyle "No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
"
1 5 Kyle "Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
"
1 5 Kyle "Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Mr. Garrison?
"
1 5 Kyle "With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
"
1 5 Kyle "That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
"
1 5 Kyle "Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
"
1 5 Kyle "I'll bet you can't.
"
1 5 Kyle "Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!
"
1 5 Kyle "We can use Cartman's pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
"
1 5 Kyle "Ready to go Stan?
"
1 5 Kyle "To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
"
1 5 Kyle "We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
"
1 5 Kyle "Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
"
1 5 Kyle "This must be it. 
"
1 5 Kyle "No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
"
1 5 Kyle "It's just a stupid pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
"
1 5 Kyle "There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
"
1 5 Kyle "Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
"
1 5 Kyle "How does that make the world better?
"
1 5 Kyle "Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
"
1 5 Kyle "Which song is that?
"
1 5 Kyle "Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
"
1 5 Kyle "Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
"
1 5 Kyle "No! We're already halfway done.
"
1 5 Kyle "It's more than you've got!
"
1 5 Kyle "Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey Chef.
"
1 5 Kyle "We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
"
1 5 Kyle "I told you guys.
"
1 5 Kyle "You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
"
1 5 Kyle "We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
"
1 5 Kyle "Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you.""
"
1 5 Kyle "Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on Kenny.
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on elephant, keep drinking.
"
1 5 Kyle "Dammit! This is never gonna work.
"
1 5 Kyle "Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey look!  It's working.
"
1 5 Kyle "Aah!
"
1 5 Kyle "Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
"
1 5 Kyle "I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
"
1 5 Kyle "Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
"
1 5 Kyle "Is he bigger than a regular clone?
"
1 5 Kyle "How big do you think he is?
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on, let's go!
"
1 5 Kyle "Wait, Stan, there he goes.
"
1 5 Kyle "He recognizes you dude.
"
1 5 Kyle "What should we do with him?
"
1 5 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
"
1 5 Kyle "Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
"
1 6 Kyle "Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
"
1 6 Kyle "But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
"
1 6 Kyle "Ow! What the hell was that for?!
"
1 6 Kyle "Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
"
1 6 Kyle "But won't your grampa be there?
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
"
1 6 Kyle "I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
"
1 6 Kyle "Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
"
1 6 Kyle "What are they doing in there?
"
1 6 Kyle "Yep, all done.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, stupid!
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, it, it looks like...
"
1 6 Kyle "Why is Death coming after us?
"
1 6 Kyle "What are we gonna do?
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
"
1 6 Kyle "Good point man.
"
1 6 Kyle "Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
1 6 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
"
1 6 Kyle "Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
"
1 6 Kyle "Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
"
1 7 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 7 Kyle "It looks like a UFO.
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
"
1 7 Kyle "Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
"
1 7 Kyle "What uh, what are you supposed to be?
"
1 7 Kyle "Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
"
1 7 Kyle "No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
"
1 7 Kyle "Wow! Cool!
"
1 7 Kyle "Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
"
1 7 Kyle "No it's not cool!
"
1 7 Kyle "Hehe. Sissy.
"
1 7 Kyle "You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
"
1 7 Kyle "Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
"
1 7 Kyle "Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dammit!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
"
1 7 Kyle "Wookies don't live on Endor!
"
1 7 Kyle "Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
"
1 7 Kyle "Aren't you hungry Kenny? 
"
1 7 Kyle "Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
"
1 7 Kyle "Check this out!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, I thought she was dead.
"
1 7 Kyle "What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
"
1 7 Kyle "Hey dudes.
"
1 7 Kyle "Check.
"
1 7 Kyle "What's that?
"
1 7 Kyle "You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 
"
1 7 Kyle "Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
"
1 7 Kyle "If everyone is turned into zombies...
"
1 7 Kyle "Chef, you've gotta help us!
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, I'm scared.
"
1 7 Kyle "I found it! I found it!
"
1 7 Kyle "See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
"
1 7 Kyle "Chef!!! 
"
1 7 Kyle "But the zombies are coming!
"
1 7 Kyle "There's a bunch of zombies here!
"
1 7 Kyle "Uh, okay. Then what?
"
1 7 Kyle "Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
"
1 7 Kyle "Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
"
1 7 Kyle "Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
"
1 7 Kyle "It's working! They're turning back to normal.
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
"
1 7 Kyle "...No, dude, that's Christmas.
"
1 7 Kyle "Costumes and candy.
"
1 7 Kyle "We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
1 8 Kyle "Oh, cool.
"
1 8 Kyle "Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
"
1 8 Kyle "Did they say if it's waterproof?
"
1 8 Kyle "What did she say?
"
1 8 Kyle "Ass-raper.
"
1 8 Kyle "Ask her if we get the watch right away.
"
1 8 Kyle "I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
"
1 8 Kyle "Hey, look you guys.
"
1 8 Kyle "The digital sports watch is here.
"
1 8 Kyle "Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
"
1 8 Kyle "Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
"
1 8 Kyle "What's your name dude?
"
1 8 Kyle "Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
"
1 8 Kyle "Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
"
1 8 Kyle "Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
"
1 8 Kyle "Totally. 
"
1 8 Kyle "We do!
"
1 8 Kyle "This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, that one.
"
1 8 Kyle "Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
"
1 8 Kyle "But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
"
1 8 Kyle "Because why?
"
1 8 Kyle "Then you take care of him.
"
1 8 Kyle "You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
"
1 8 Kyle "Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
"
1 8 Kyle "I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
"
1 8 Kyle "Here you go turkeys! 
"
1 8 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
"
1 9 Kyle "Come on, Mary!  Push!
"
1 9 Kyle "I can see its head!
"
1 9 Kyle "It's a boy! 
"
1 9 Kyle "...Sorry
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, fat boy!
"
1 9 Kyle "I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
"
1 9 Kyle "We can, too!
"
1 9 Kyle "Officer Barbrady!
"
1 9 Kyle "Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
"
1 9 Kyle "Damnit!
"
1 9 Kyle "No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
1 9 Kyle "Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
"
1 9 Kyle "It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
"
1 9 Kyle "What's going on, you guys?
"
1 9 Kyle "Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
1 9 Kyle "It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait...
"
1 9 Kyle "But dad, he always sh...
"
1 9 Kyle "There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
"
1 9 Kyle "I said Ike's on fire!
"
1 9 Kyle "It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm not hearing that.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey?
"
1 9 Kyle "Go away, Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
"
1 9 Kyle "Nothing.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, come here. 
"
1 9 Kyle "Say something, Mr. Hankey! 
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
"
1 9 Kyle "Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
"
1 9 Kyle "Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
"
1 9 Kyle "Yeah!  We'll show them! 
"
1 9 Kyle "Hello, everybodyyy.
"
1 9 Kyle "It's a surprise.
"
1 9 Kyle "O-Okay.  But don't scare him...
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait! You guys!  He's alive!  
"
1 9 Kyle "Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, no!
"
1 9 Kyle "Uuuuuuhh...
"
1 9 Kyle "I don't have a problem.
"
1 9 Kyle "What's that?
"
1 9 Kyle "Mookie-stinks?
"
1 9 Kyle "Wull, not on purpose.
"
1 9 Kyle "Well, sometimes...
"
1 9 Kyle "Well sure.
"
1 9 Kyle "No, dude!
"
1 9 Kyle "But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
"
1 9 Kyle "Here.  Just look more closely at it.
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
"
1 9 Kyle "No.
"
1 9 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...
"
1 9 Kyle "Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
"
1 9 Kyle "Friends? 
"
1 9 Kyle "You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
"
1 9 Kyle "Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
"
1 10 Kyle "What is this, Cartman?
"
1 10 Kyle "Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
"
1 10 Kyle "Damn, what a freak!
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, that's weak!
"
1 10 Kyle "You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
"
1 10 Kyle "Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
"
1 10 Kyle "Bad.
"
1 10 Kyle "Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
"
1 10 Kyle "The new kid.
"
1 10 Kyle "We told you, dude. 
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
1 10 Kyle "... K.
"
1 10 Kyle "Ohh, dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
"
1 10 Kyle "See ya.
"
1 10 Kyle "We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, you have to hit him.
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, you just got here, Chef!
"
1 10 Kyle "And neither were you, Pip!
"
1 10 Kyle "Wow!
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
"
1 10 Kyle "It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
"
1 10 Kyle "Aaaaa!
"
1 10 Kyle "They were all out of 'em dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "Aaaaaaaa!
"
1 10 Kyle "Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
"
1 10 Kyle "Uuuuh. Stan?
"
1 10 Kyle "Stan.
"
1 10 Kyle "Stan!
"
1 10 Kyle "Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
"
1 10 Kyle "Hmmm.
"
1 10 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
"
1 11 Kyle "We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
"
1 11 Kyle "Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
"
1 11 Kyle "Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
"
1 11 Kyle "Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 
"
1 11 Kyle "Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
"
1 11 Kyle "My laundry detergent?
"
1 11 Kyle "Yup!
"
1 11 Kyle "Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
"
1 11 Kyle "Where's your present, Cartman?
"
1 11 Kyle "Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
"
1 11 Kyle "No, she wasn't!
"
1 11 Kyle "Oh cool.
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.
"
1 11 Kyle "How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
1 11 Kyle "A plebeian?
"
1 11 Kyle "Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
"
1 11 Kyle "Hey, yeah!
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
"
1 11 Kyle "Really?
"
1 11 Kyle "And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
"
1 11 Kyle "Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah!
"
1 11 Kyle "So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
1 11 Kyle "Down by the fire?
"
1 11 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 11 Kyle "Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
"
1 11 Kyle "I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
"
1 11 Kyle "How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
"
1 11 Kyle "Wendy! You didn't!
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
"
1 12 Kyle "I don't know. 
"
1 12 Kyle "That was cool!
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
"
1 12 Kyle "No way, fatty, it's mine!
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, fatso!
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
"
1 12 Kyle "You liar, Cartman!
"
1 12 Kyle "I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
"
1 12 Kyle "What would we use a marble sack for?
"
1 12 Kyle "I didn't steal anything.
"
1 12 Kyle "Good! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa!
"
1 12 Kyle "No.
"
1 12 Kyle "Aagh! Stop that!
"
1 12 Kyle "Yyeeaahh.
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, Cartman!
"
1 12 Kyle "Yeah. How'd you know?
"
1 12 Kyle "Triangle of Zinthar?
"
1 12 Kyle "AAAAAA!
"
1 12 Kyle "Cartman?
"
1 12 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
"
1 12 Kyle "Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
"
1 12 Kyle "If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
"
1 12 Kyle "Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
"
1 12 Kyle "Your triangle?
"
1 12 Kyle "Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
"
1 12 Kyle "Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
"
1 12 Kyle "Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
"
1 12 Kyle "Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
"
1 12 Kyle "Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa, that was cool!
"
1 12 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 12 Kyle "The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
"
1 12 Kyle "No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!
"
1 12 Kyle "Disintegration is the best album everrr!
"
1 12 Kyle "We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
1 12 Kyle "But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah.
"
1 13 Kyle "Whoa, dude.
"
1 13 Kyle "Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
"
1 13 Kyle "Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
"
1 13 Kyle "Really?
"
1 13 Kyle "Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
"
1 13 Kyle "Woo-whataya mean?
"
1 13 Kyle "How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Hunh?
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
"
1 13 Kyle "Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
"
1 13 Kyle "Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
"
1 13 Kyle "If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
"
1 13 Kyle "You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
"
1 13 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah, with butterscotch. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Woohoo!
"
1 13 Kyle "We're gonna win $10,000! 
"
1 13 Kyle "I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
"
1 13 Kyle "Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
1 13 Kyle "Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
"
1 13 Kyle "They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
"
1 13 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 13 Kyle "Dammit!
"
1 13 Kyle "Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
"
1 13 Kyle "Dad, how could you?!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, what?
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
1 1 Kyle "Kick the baby. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
1 1 Kyle "Totally!
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah, fat boy saw it!
"
1 1 Kyle "What's an anal probe?
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
"
1 1 Kyle "Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "No, Ike, go home.
"
1 1 Kyle "This is it. This one's for the game.
"
1 1 Kyle "Kick the baby! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Damn it, he's still there.
"
1 1 Kyle "No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike! Go home!
"
1 1 Kyle "Oh, my God! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
"
1 1 Kyle "But I have to get off!
"
1 1 Kyle "No.
"
1 1 Kyle "But I...
"
1 1 Kyle "Arrghh!
"
1 1 Kyle "I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
"
1 1 Kyle "What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?""
"
1 1 Kyle """You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?""
"
1 1 Kyle "Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
"
1 1 Kyle "No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
"
1 1 Kyle "I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
"
1 1 Kyle "Damn it!
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude!
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, he's farting fire!
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
"
1 1 Kyle "Dude, what does the note say?
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
"
1 1 Kyle "Bad.
"
1 1 Kyle "Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
"
1 1 Kyle "No!
"
1 1 Kyle "Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
"
1 1 Kyle "That was cool!
"
1 1 Kyle "Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
"
1 1 Kyle "Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
"
1 1 Kyle "He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey!
"
1 1 Kyle "If you visitors can hear me- 
"
1 1 Kyle "-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
"
1 1 Kyle "Give me back my brother! 
"
1 1 Kyle "You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
"
1 1 Kyle "Now do you believe us, Cartman?
"
1 1 Kyle "Cartman, they killed Kenny!
"
1 1 Kyle "He's dead, Cartman! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
"
1 1 Kyle "You're all I have left, Stan.
"
1 1 Kyle "You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
"
1 1 Kyle "Rats.
"
1 1 Kyle "Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
"
1 1 Kyle "You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
"
1 1 Kyle "Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
"
1 1 Kyle "Just make sweet love down by the fire.
"
1 1 Kyle "...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
"
1 1 Kyle "Why?
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
"
1 1 Kyle "How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
"
1 1 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
1 1 Kyle "Fart, damn you!
"
1 1 Kyle "Whoa, look at that.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
"
1 1 Kyle "Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
"
1 1 Kyle "Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
"
1 1 Kyle "Did it work?
"
1 1 Kyle "Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
"
1 1 Kyle "You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike!
"
1 1 Kyle "Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
"
1 1 Kyle "Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
"
1 1 Kyle "Yeh, we're running out of friends.
"
1 1 Kyle "Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
"
1 1 Kyle "Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
"
1 2 Kyle "Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
"
1 2 Kyle "Nobody hates rainbows.
"
1 2 Kyle "Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
"
1 2 Kyle "No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
"
1 2 Kyle "Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
"
1 2 Kyle "What was your paper about Wendy?
"
1 2 Kyle "Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
"
1 2 Kyle "Wow, are you gonna do it?
"
1 2 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
"
1 2 Kyle "Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Bulk up to what, fatass?
"
1 2 Kyle "Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
"
1 2 Kyle "You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
"
1 2 Kyle "Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!""
"
1 2 Kyle "I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
"
1 2 Kyle "Stop who?
"
1 2 Kyle "Uh oh, we're losing him. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
"
1 2 Kyle "Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
"
1 2 Kyle "Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
"
1 3 Kyle "Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
"
1 3 Kyle "Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
"
1 3 Kyle "I like chocolate milk.
"
1 3 Kyle "Wow, that'd be cool.
"
1 3 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
1 3 Kyle "I guess so.
"
1 3 Kyle "What?!
"
1 3 Kyle "Shoot it Stan.
"
1 3 Kyle "Hey, what's that?
"
1 3 Kyle "You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
"
1 3 Kyle "No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
"
1 3 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
"
1 3 Kyle "Deformed how?
"
1 3 Kyle "A knife.
"
1 3 Kyle "Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
"
1 3 Kyle "Yeah, give me that flashlight. 
"
1 3 Kyle "What is that?
"
1 3 Kyle "Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
"
1 3 Kyle "Stan, Stan, wake up!
"
1 3 Kyle "I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
"
1 3 Kyle "They're out fishing with Kenny.
"
1 3 Kyle "Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
"
1 3 Kyle "Look!
"
1 3 Kyle "Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
"
1 3 Kyle "Look, up there.
"
1 3 Kyle "Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
"
1 3 Kyle "Whoa!
"
1 3 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1 3 Kyle "Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
1 3 Kyle "Aaaaah! 
"
1 3 Kyle "Hey look, Kenny's okay.
"
1 3 Kyle "Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
"
1 3 Kyle "Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
"
1 4 Kyle "Who's that?
"
1 4 Kyle "Wow! Cool!
"
1 4 Kyle "You're on, dude. 
"
1 4 Kyle "I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
"
1 4 Kyle "Who's Middle Park?
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
"
1 4 Kyle "You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
"
1 4 Kyle "Did it work?
"
1 4 Kyle "Oolala 
"
1 4 Kyle "Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
"
1 4 Kyle "Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
"
1 4 Kyle "What'd he say?
"
1 4 Kyle "Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
"
1 4 Kyle "Uh, Chef?
"
1 4 Kyle "Chef.
"
1 4 Kyle "Chef!
"
1 4 Kyle "What's the matter dude?
"
1 4 Kyle "Wow, it's been like two days.
"
1 4 Kyle "We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
"
1 4 Kyle "You what?!
"
1 4 Kyle "But I never practiced quarterback.
"
1 4 Kyle "Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
"
1 4 Kyle "Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!
"
1 4 Kyle "Cartman farted!
"
1 4 Kyle "No way dude!
"
1 4 Kyle "Ah, dude, weak.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hut.
"
1 4 Kyle "Hut, hut. 
"
1 4 Kyle "Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
"
1 4 Kyle "Hike!
"
1 4 Kyle "Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.
"
1 4 Kyle "Oof. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
"
1 5 Kyle "You mean this one?
"
1 5 Kyle "He's my new pet elephant.
"
1 5 Kyle "I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
"
1 5 Kyle "No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
"
1 5 Kyle "Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
"
1 5 Kyle "Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Mr. Garrison?
"
1 5 Kyle "With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
"
1 5 Kyle "That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
"
1 5 Kyle "Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
"
1 5 Kyle "I'll bet you can't.
"
1 5 Kyle "Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!
"
1 5 Kyle "We can use Cartman's pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
"
1 5 Kyle "Ready to go Stan?
"
1 5 Kyle "To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
"
1 5 Kyle "We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
"
1 5 Kyle "Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
"
1 5 Kyle "This must be it. 
"
1 5 Kyle "No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
"
1 5 Kyle "It's just a stupid pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
"
1 5 Kyle "There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
"
1 5 Kyle "Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
"
1 5 Kyle "How does that make the world better?
"
1 5 Kyle "Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
"
1 5 Kyle "Which song is that?
"
1 5 Kyle "Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
"
1 5 Kyle "Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
"
1 5 Kyle "No! We're already halfway done.
"
1 5 Kyle "It's more than you've got!
"
1 5 Kyle "Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey Chef.
"
1 5 Kyle "We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
"
1 5 Kyle "I told you guys.
"
1 5 Kyle "You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
"
1 5 Kyle "We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
"
1 5 Kyle "Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you.""
"
1 5 Kyle "Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on Kenny.
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on elephant, keep drinking.
"
1 5 Kyle "Dammit! This is never gonna work.
"
1 5 Kyle "Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey look!  It's working.
"
1 5 Kyle "Aah!
"
1 5 Kyle "Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
"
1 5 Kyle "I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
"
1 5 Kyle "Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
"
1 5 Kyle "Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
"
1 5 Kyle "Is he bigger than a regular clone?
"
1 5 Kyle "How big do you think he is?
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
"
1 5 Kyle "Come on, let's go!
"
1 5 Kyle "Wait, Stan, there he goes.
"
1 5 Kyle "He recognizes you dude.
"
1 5 Kyle "What should we do with him?
"
1 5 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
"
1 5 Kyle "Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
"
1 5 Kyle "Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
"
1 5 Kyle "Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
"
1 6 Kyle "Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
"
1 6 Kyle "But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
"
1 6 Kyle "Ow! What the hell was that for?!
"
1 6 Kyle "Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
"
1 6 Kyle "But won't your grampa be there?
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
"
1 6 Kyle "I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
"
1 6 Kyle "Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
"
1 6 Kyle "What are they doing in there?
"
1 6 Kyle "Yep, all done.
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, stupid!
"
1 6 Kyle "Well, it, it looks like...
"
1 6 Kyle "Why is Death coming after us?
"
1 6 Kyle "What are we gonna do?
"
1 6 Kyle "Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
"
1 6 Kyle "Good point man.
"
1 6 Kyle "Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
1 6 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
"
1 6 Kyle "Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
"
1 6 Kyle "Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
"
1 7 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 7 Kyle "It looks like a UFO.
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
"
1 7 Kyle "Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
"
1 7 Kyle "What uh, what are you supposed to be?
"
1 7 Kyle "Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
"
1 7 Kyle "No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
"
1 7 Kyle "Wow! Cool!
"
1 7 Kyle "Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
"
1 7 Kyle "No it's not cool!
"
1 7 Kyle "Hehe. Sissy.
"
1 7 Kyle "You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
"
1 7 Kyle "Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
"
1 7 Kyle "Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dammit!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
"
1 7 Kyle "Wookies don't live on Endor!
"
1 7 Kyle "Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
"
1 7 Kyle "Aren't you hungry Kenny? 
"
1 7 Kyle "Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
"
1 7 Kyle "Check this out!
"
1 7 Kyle "I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
"
1 7 Kyle "Dude, I thought she was dead.
"
1 7 Kyle "What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
"
1 7 Kyle "Hey dudes.
"
1 7 Kyle "Check.
"
1 7 Kyle "What's that?
"
1 7 Kyle "You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 
"
1 7 Kyle "Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
"
1 7 Kyle "If everyone is turned into zombies...
"
1 7 Kyle "Chef, you've gotta help us!
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, I'm scared.
"
1 7 Kyle "I found it! I found it!
"
1 7 Kyle "See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
"
1 7 Kyle "Chef!!! 
"
1 7 Kyle "But the zombies are coming!
"
1 7 Kyle "There's a bunch of zombies here!
"
1 7 Kyle "Uh, okay. Then what?
"
1 7 Kyle "Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
"
1 7 Kyle "Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
"
1 7 Kyle "Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
"
1 7 Kyle "It's working! They're turning back to normal.
"
1 7 Kyle "Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
"
1 7 Kyle "...No, dude, that's Christmas.
"
1 7 Kyle "Costumes and candy.
"
1 7 Kyle "We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
1 8 Kyle "Oh, cool.
"
1 8 Kyle "Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
"
1 8 Kyle "Did they say if it's waterproof?
"
1 8 Kyle "What did she say?
"
1 8 Kyle "Ass-raper.
"
1 8 Kyle "Ask her if we get the watch right away.
"
1 8 Kyle "I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
"
1 8 Kyle "Hey, look you guys.
"
1 8 Kyle "The digital sports watch is here.
"
1 8 Kyle "Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
"
1 8 Kyle "Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
"
1 8 Kyle "What's your name dude?
"
1 8 Kyle "Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
"
1 8 Kyle "Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
"
1 8 Kyle "Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
"
1 8 Kyle "Totally. 
"
1 8 Kyle "We do!
"
1 8 Kyle "This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, that one.
"
1 8 Kyle "Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
"
1 8 Kyle "But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
"
1 8 Kyle "Because why?
"
1 8 Kyle "Then you take care of him.
"
1 8 Kyle "You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
"
1 8 Kyle "Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
"
1 8 Kyle "I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
"
1 8 Kyle "Here you go turkeys! 
"
1 8 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
"
1 8 Kyle "Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
"
1 9 Kyle "Come on, Mary!  Push!
"
1 9 Kyle "I can see its head!
"
1 9 Kyle "It's a boy! 
"
1 9 Kyle "...Sorry
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, fat boy!
"
1 9 Kyle "I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
"
1 9 Kyle "We can, too!
"
1 9 Kyle "Officer Barbrady!
"
1 9 Kyle "Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
"
1 9 Kyle "Damnit!
"
1 9 Kyle "No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
1 9 Kyle "Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
"
1 9 Kyle "It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
"
1 9 Kyle "What's going on, you guys?
"
1 9 Kyle "Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
1 9 Kyle "It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait...
"
1 9 Kyle "But dad, he always sh...
"
1 9 Kyle "There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
"
1 9 Kyle "I said Ike's on fire!
"
1 9 Kyle "It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm not hearing that.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey?
"
1 9 Kyle "Go away, Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
"
1 9 Kyle "Nothing.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, come here. 
"
1 9 Kyle "Say something, Mr. Hankey! 
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
"
1 9 Kyle "Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
"
1 9 Kyle "Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
"
1 9 Kyle "Yeah!  We'll show them! 
"
1 9 Kyle "Hello, everybodyyy.
"
1 9 Kyle "It's a surprise.
"
1 9 Kyle "O-Okay.  But don't scare him...
"
1 9 Kyle "Wait! You guys!  He's alive!  
"
1 9 Kyle "Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Shut up, Cartman!
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey.
"
1 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey, no!
"
1 9 Kyle "Uuuuuuhh...
"
1 9 Kyle "I don't have a problem.
"
1 9 Kyle "What's that?
"
1 9 Kyle "Mookie-stinks?
"
1 9 Kyle "Wull, not on purpose.
"
1 9 Kyle "Well, sometimes...
"
1 9 Kyle "Well sure.
"
1 9 Kyle "No, dude!
"
1 9 Kyle "But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
"
1 9 Kyle "Here.  Just look more closely at it.
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
"
1 9 Kyle "No.
"
1 9 Kyle "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
"
1 9 Kyle "I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...
"
1 9 Kyle "Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
"
1 9 Kyle "Friends? 
"
1 9 Kyle "You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
"
1 9 Kyle "Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
"
1 10 Kyle "What is this, Cartman?
"
1 10 Kyle "Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
"
1 10 Kyle "Damn, what a freak!
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, that's weak!
"
1 10 Kyle "You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
"
1 10 Kyle "Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
"
1 10 Kyle "Bad.
"
1 10 Kyle "Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
"
1 10 Kyle "The new kid.
"
1 10 Kyle "We told you, dude. 
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah.
"
1 10 Kyle "... K.
"
1 10 Kyle "Ohh, dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
"
1 10 Kyle "See ya.
"
1 10 Kyle "We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, you have to hit him.
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, you just got here, Chef!
"
1 10 Kyle "And neither were you, Pip!
"
1 10 Kyle "Wow!
"
1 10 Kyle "Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
"
1 10 Kyle "It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
"
1 10 Kyle "Aaaaa!
"
1 10 Kyle "They were all out of 'em dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "Aaaaaaaa!
"
1 10 Kyle "Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
"
1 10 Kyle "Uuuuh. Stan?
"
1 10 Kyle "Stan.
"
1 10 Kyle "Stan!
"
1 10 Kyle "Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude!
"
1 10 Kyle "Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
"
1 10 Kyle "Hmmm.
"
1 10 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 10 Kyle "Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
"
1 11 Kyle "We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
"
1 11 Kyle "Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
"
1 11 Kyle "Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
"
1 11 Kyle "Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 
"
1 11 Kyle "Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
"
1 11 Kyle "My laundry detergent?
"
1 11 Kyle "Yup!
"
1 11 Kyle "Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
"
1 11 Kyle "Where's your present, Cartman?
"
1 11 Kyle "Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
"
1 11 Kyle "No, she wasn't!
"
1 11 Kyle "Oh cool.
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.
"
1 11 Kyle "How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
1 11 Kyle "A plebeian?
"
1 11 Kyle "Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
"
1 11 Kyle "Hey, yeah!
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
"
1 11 Kyle "Really?
"
1 11 Kyle "And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
"
1 11 Kyle "Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
"
1 11 Kyle "Yeah!
"
1 11 Kyle "So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
1 11 Kyle "Down by the fire?
"
1 11 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 11 Kyle "Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
"
1 11 Kyle "I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
"
1 11 Kyle "How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
"
1 11 Kyle "Wendy! You didn't!
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
"
1 12 Kyle "I don't know. 
"
1 12 Kyle "That was cool!
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
"
1 12 Kyle "No way, fatty, it's mine!
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, fatso!
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
"
1 12 Kyle "You liar, Cartman!
"
1 12 Kyle "I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
"
1 12 Kyle "What would we use a marble sack for?
"
1 12 Kyle "I didn't steal anything.
"
1 12 Kyle "Good! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa!
"
1 12 Kyle "No.
"
1 12 Kyle "Aagh! Stop that!
"
1 12 Kyle "Yyeeaahh.
"
1 12 Kyle "You threw it away, Cartman!
"
1 12 Kyle "Yeah. How'd you know?
"
1 12 Kyle "Triangle of Zinthar?
"
1 12 Kyle "AAAAAA!
"
1 12 Kyle "Cartman?
"
1 12 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
"
1 12 Kyle "Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
"
1 12 Kyle "If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
"
1 12 Kyle "Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
"
1 12 Kyle "Your triangle?
"
1 12 Kyle "Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
"
1 12 Kyle "Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
"
1 12 Kyle "Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
"
1 12 Kyle "Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
"
1 12 Kyle "Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
"
1 12 Kyle "Whoa, that was cool!
"
1 12 Kyle "You bastard!
"
1 12 Kyle "The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
"
1 12 Kyle "No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!
"
1 12 Kyle "Disintegration is the best album everrr!
"
1 12 Kyle "We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
"
1 12 Kyle "Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
1 12 Kyle "But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah.
"
1 13 Kyle "Whoa, dude.
"
1 13 Kyle "Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
"
1 13 Kyle "Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
"
1 13 Kyle "Really?
"
1 13 Kyle "Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
"
1 13 Kyle "Woo-whataya mean?
"
1 13 Kyle "How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Hunh?
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
"
1 13 Kyle "Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
"
1 13 Kyle "Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
"
1 13 Kyle "If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
"
1 13 Kyle "You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
"
1 13 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 13 Kyle "Yeah, with butterscotch. 
"
1 13 Kyle "Woohoo!
"
1 13 Kyle "We're gonna win $10,000! 
"
1 13 Kyle "I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
"
1 13 Kyle "Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
1 13 Kyle "Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
"
1 13 Kyle "They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
"
1 13 Kyle "You bastards!
"
1 13 Kyle "Dammit!
"
1 13 Kyle "Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
"
1 13 Kyle "Dad, how could you?!
"
