6 1 Stan "Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
"
6 1 Stan "Hey Kenny
"
6 1 Stan "We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
"
6 1 Stan "What kind of help?
"
6 1 Stan "I'll bet you can.
"
6 1 Stan "Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
"
6 1 Stan "Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
"
6 1 Stan "He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
"
6 1 Stan "You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
"
6 1 Stan "Marry him?
"
6 1 Stan "Chef, we need more food.
"
6 1 Stan "Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
"
6 1 Stan "How do you feel, Butters?
"
6 1 Stan "Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
"
6 1 Stan "We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
"
6 1 Stan "Did you bring the camera?
"
6 1 Stan "That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
"
6 1 Stan "Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
"
6 1 Stan "Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
"
6 1 Stan "All prepared for liposuction surgery?
"
6 1 Stan "Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
"
6 1 Stan "We've gotta hurry this up. 
"
6 1 Stan "He's losing weight. 
"
6 1 Stan "Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
"
6 1 Stan "Dude, bail! 
"
6 1 Stan "Come on, Butters. Time to go.
"
6 1 Stan "What?
"
6 1 Stan "...Kenny would have done it.
"
6 1 Stan "Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
"
6 1 Stan "What?!
"
6 1 Stan "Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
"
6 1 Stan "Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
"
6 1 Stan "No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
"
6 1 Stan "Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
"
6 1 Stan "Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
"
6 1 Stan "Oh God-damnit!
"
6 1 Stan "Why?
"
6 1 Stan "Well, so much for our money.
"
6 2 Stan "He's such a douchebag
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah, and then what?
"
6 2 Stan "They're still asleep.
"
6 2 Stan "What's a Hitler?
"
6 2 Stan "No, I never have.
"
6 2 Stan "Smell what?
"
6 2 Stan "Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
"
6 2 Stan "Uhh... no.
"
6 2 Stan "Stan. Marsh.
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I'm just learning.
"
6 2 Stan "I never said I was.
"
6 2 Stan "...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
"
6 2 Stan "Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
"
6 2 Stan "Oh no.
"
6 2 Stan "Heather? 
"
6 2 Stan "...who are you people?!
"
6 2 Stan "All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
"
6 2 Stan "Okay.
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah, prob'ly
"
6 2 Stan "Fries... fries...
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
"
6 2 Stan "Thanks. Who are you?
"
6 2 Stan "I' seems fine.
"
6 2 Stan "Don't care. 
"
6 2 Stan "I dunno.
"
6 2 Stan "Oh,. God. 
"
6 2 Stan "Gah, let's go you guys. 
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
"
6 2 Stan "I raced you, You won!
"
6 2 Stan "What?
"
6 2 Stan "I'll be there, you queen!
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, he's got Heather!
"
6 2 Stan "I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
"
6 2 Stan "...Thank you.
"
6 2 Stan "This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "That does it! I'm calling the police! 
"
6 2 Stan "Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
"
6 2 Stan "I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "Pizza... pizza... pizza...
"
6 2 Stan "Thanks. 
"
6 2 Stan "Where the hell have you guys been?!
"
6 2 Stan "No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
"
6 3 Stan "Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"
6 3 Stan "Hey Kenny! 
"
6 3 Stan "Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
"
6 3 Stan "Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
"
6 3 Stan "What disease should we say?
"
6 3 Stan "What? 
"
6 3 Stan "This is gonna be so funny!
"
6 3 Stan "We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
"
6 3 Stan "It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
"
6 3 Stan "Kenny woulda done it. 
"
6 3 Stan "Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
"
6 3 Stan "Where's you get the balls from?
"
6 3 Stan "Wow!
"
6 3 Stan "All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
"
6 3 Stan "That's your flight, Butters.
"
6 3 Stan "Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
"
6 3 Stan "Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
"
6 3 Stan "Here he comes.
"
6 3 Stan "But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
"
6 3 Stan "Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
"
6 3 Stan "Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
"
6 3 Stan "I- told them where to find you.
"
6 3 Stan "Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
"
6 4 Stan "Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, I wouldn't have.
"
6 4 Stan "Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.
"
6 4 Stan "Pst, Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Cartman, wake up!
"
6 4 Stan "We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
"
6 4 Stan "So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
"
6 4 Stan "We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
"
6 4 Stan "Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
"
6 4 Stan "Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
"
6 4 Stan "Go on, dude it's the only way.
"
6 4 Stan "Just do it really fast, and we can go.
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
"
6 4 Stan "I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
"
6 4 Stan "Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
"
6 4 Stan "They aren't leaving.
"
6 4 Stan "Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
"
6 4 Stan "I don't know.
"
6 4 Stan "We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
"
6 4 Stan "We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
"
6 4 Stan "Butters!  Did you bring it?
"
6 4 Stan "What?
"
6 4 Stan "Aw crap!
"
6 4 Stan "That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
"
6 4 Stan "They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
"
6 4 Stan "No!
"
6 4 Stan "You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
"
6 4 Stan "Kiss my ass!
"
6 4 Stan "I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
"
6 4 Stan "Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
"
6 4 Stan "Shut up, Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
"
6 4 Stan "This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
"
6 4 Stan "Round one is over. We made it. 
"
6 4 Stan "Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
"
6 4 Stan "Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
"
6 4 Stan "We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
"
6 4 Stan "No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
"
6 4 Stan "Wait, what is that?  Dude!
"
6 4 Stan "See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
"
6 4 Stan "Wha? 
"
6 4 Stan "Dude, what are you guys doing?
"
6 4 Stan "You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
"
6 4 Stan "That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
"
6 4 Stan "No, this is exactly what we wanted.
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
"
6 4 Stan "...I don't believe it.
"
6 4 Stan "Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
"
6 4 Stan "What are they doing here?
"
6 4 Stan "Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
"
6 4 Stan "No!
"
6 4 Stan "Hello?
"
6 4 Stan "Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
"
6 4 Stan "What do I say??
"
6 4 Stan "Cartman, no!
"
6 4 Stan "O-ogh...
"
6 4 Stan "It... did?
"
6 4 Stan "Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
"
6 4 Stan "We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
"
6 4 Stan "Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
"
6 5 Stan "This is gonna be so awesome!
"
6 5 Stan "Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
"
6 5 Stan "Alright, here we go.
"
6 5 Stan "Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
"
6 5 Stan "No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 
"
6 5 Stan "It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
"
6 5 Stan "But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
"
6 5 Stan "But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
"
6 5 Stan "Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
"
6 5 Stan "O-K, deal.
"
6 5 Stan "Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, I'm not going.
"
6 5 Stan "Stan.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
"
6 5 Stan "They look fine to me. 
"
6 5 Stan "That's worse!
"
6 5 Stan "Dude!
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, the commercials could start any time!
"
6 5 Stan "Get all the stuff! 
"
6 5 Stan "We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
"
6 5 Stan "Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
"
6 5 Stan "Huff, huff
"
6 5 Stan "Aww! 
"
6 5 Stan "AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
"
6 5 Stan "Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
"
6 5 Stan "We made it!
"
6 5 Stan "Here they come!
"
6 5 Stan "I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
"
6 5 Stan "Oh God-dammit!
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 
"
6 5 Stan "The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
"
6 5 Stan "We made it.
"
6 5 Stan "But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
"
6 5 Stan "Commercial Break Number Two! 
"
6 5 Stan "I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
"
6 5 Stan "Oh, God, it's horrible! 
"
6 5 Stan "We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
"
6 5 Stan "Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
"
6 5 Stan "Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
"
6 5 Stan "She has to! 
"
6 5 Stan "Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
"
6 5 Stan "What?
"
6 5 Stan "The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
"
6 5 Stan "We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
"
6 5 Stan "We made it! 
"
6 5 Stan "Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
"
6 5 Stan "Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!
"
6 5 Stan "That looks AWEsome! 
"
6 5 Stan "Oh, dude, let's go!
"
6 5 Stan "I wonder if it's all a western?
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, here he comes. 
"
6 6 Stan "Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
"
6 6 Stan "All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
"
6 6 Stan "So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
"
6 6 Stan "One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
"
6 6 Stan "All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, next? 
"
6 6 Stan "Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 
"
6 6 Stan "Shut up, fatass! 
"
6 6 Stan "I like it. 
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, let's try this. 
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
"
6 6 Stan "Oh, this is giving me a headache.
"
6 6 Stan "You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
"
6 6 Stan "How about Token? 
"
6 6 Stan "That's great.
"
6 6 Stan "Suckup.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 
"
6 7 Stan "Just put it between his eyes.
"
6 7 Stan "Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
"
6 7 Stan "Oh, hey Butters.
"
6 7 Stan "Uh oh.
"
6 7 Stan "Alright, I'll chip in.
"
6 7 Stan "Ready. Let's see 'em.
"
6 7 Stan "Are they playing basketball? 
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
"
6 7 Stan "What are we gonna do with them?
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, that'd be funny.
"
6 7 Stan "Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
"
6 7 Stan "Oh jeez, change the channel.
"
6 7 Stan "They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
"
6 7 Stan "We're dead!
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
"
6 7 Stan "Chef, we did something kind of bad.
"
6 7 Stan "We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
"
6 7 Stan "We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
"
6 7 Stan "So what should we do? 
"
6 7 Stan "This is it.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, stupid.
"
6 7 Stan "Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
"
6 7 Stan "What do we do now?
"
6 7 Stan "Do you see the sea people.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 7 Stan "Aaah!
"
6 7 Stan "Let's go! 
"
6 7 Stan "The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
"
6 7 Stan "...and then we put them back in the tank.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 
"
6 7 Stan "Oh no, what now? 
"
6 7 Stan "Wow. How did that happen?
"
6 7 Stan "They've already accomplished so much.
"
6 7 Stan "Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
"
6 7 Stan "Well, drop them in! 
"
6 7 Stan "That's cool.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
"
6 7 Stan "...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
"
6 7 Stan "Hm.
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
"
6 7 Stan "The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
"
6 8 Stan "That sounds pretty fun.
"
6 8 Stan "What are they talking about?
"
6 8 Stan "Um, cool.
"
6 8 Stan "...Like ...money? What?
"
6 8 Stan "What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
"
6 8 Stan "We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
"
6 8 Stan "We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
"
6 8 Stan "Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
"
6 8 Stan "What?
"
6 8 Stan "Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
"
6 8 Stan "You've had five, dude!
"
6 8 Stan "Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
"
6 8 Stan "What? He did.
"
6 8 Stan "Yeah it does.
"
6 8 Stan "Yeah. It does. 
"
6 8 Stan "So?
"
6 8 Stan "Dude, look.
"
6 8 Stan "Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"
6 9 Stan "Oh, cool. A preview. 
"
6 9 Stan "Aw, dude, why would they do that?
"
6 9 Stan "That's gay. 
"
6 9 Stan "Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
"
6 9 Stan "Goddamnit, that pissed me off!
"
6 9 Stan "Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
"
6 9 Stan "We have to do something. Let's form a club.
"
6 9 Stan "No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
"
6 9 Stan "Well what's wrong with it?
"
6 9 Stan "Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
"
6 9 Stan "What?
"
6 9 Stan "Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
"
6 9 Stan "Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
"
6 9 Stan "Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
"
6 9 Stan "Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
"
6 9 Stan "You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
"
6 9 Stan "Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
"
6 9 Stan "Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
"
6 9 Stan "Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
"
6 9 Stan "...212, 213, 214 members!
"
6 9 Stan "Really? That's great.
"
6 9 Stan "If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
"
6 9 Stan "When did we do dibs for it?
"
6 9 Stan "Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
"
6 9 Stan "Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
"
6 9 Stan "That is our understanding.
"
6 9 Stan "It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
"
6 9 Stan "Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"
6 9 Stan "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
"
6 9 Stan "Okay, go. 
"
6 9 Stan "Over here! 
"
6 9 Stan "Aw, really?
"
6 9 Stan "Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"
6 9 Stan "So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song
"
6 9 Stan "Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
"
6 9 Stan "You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
"
6 9 Stan "Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
"
6 9 Stan "Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
"
6 9 Stan "He's definitely lost it
"
6 9 Stan "You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
"
6 9 Stan "Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
"
6 9 Stan "Yuh, you guys okay. 
"
6 9 Stan "Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
6 9 Stan "Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
"
6 9 Stan "Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
"
6 10 Stan "Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
"
6 10 Stan "Ah, hey, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
"
6 10 Stan "Hellafun
"
6 10 Stan "Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
"
6 10 Stan "So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "...Wait, what were we doing again?
"
6 10 Stan "Hey, that's what I wrote about!
"
6 10 Stan "Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
"
6 10 Stan "That's such a great paper! 
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 10 Stan "Uh huh.
"
6 10 Stan "That would be best.
"
6 10 Stan "Kyle??
"
6 10 Stan "Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
"
6 10 Stan "No!
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 10 Stan "Sure thing, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
"
6 10 Stan "Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
"
6 10 Stan "Is Bebe home?
"
6 10 Stan "Cartman's?
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh! 
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! 
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh. Hoh?
"
6 10 Stan "Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
"
6 10 Stan "Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta. Ah, ahta!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahah
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta? 
"
6 10 Stan "Friend. Ahta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta! 
"
6 10 Stan "Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
"
6 10 Stan "Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
"
6 10 Stan "I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
"
6 11 Stan "I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
"
6 11 Stan "Child Tracker?
"
6 11 Stan "...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
"
6 11 Stan "I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
"
6 11 Stan "Huh?
"
6 11 Stan "But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
"
6 11 Stan "I'm not done with my pizza.
"
6 11 Stan "Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
"
6 11 Stan "But why do I have to leave?
"
6 11 Stan "Where are we supposed to go?
"
6 11 Stan "Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
"
6 11 Stan "Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 
"
6 11 Stan "Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
"
6 11 Stan "Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
"
6 11 Stan "Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
"
6 12 Stan "We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
"
6 12 Stan "Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
"
6 12 Stan "Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
"
6 12 Stan "We've gotta find that ticket!
"
6 12 Stan "You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
"
6 12 Stan "Where's Kenny??
"
6 12 Stan "Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
"
6 12 Stan "Did you get it? 
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
"
6 12 Stan "I can't see. 
"
6 12 Stan "It wa a trick!
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
"
6 12 Stan "We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
"
6 12 Stan "Cartman, come on!
"
6 12 Stan "Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
"
6 12 Stan "Because we wanna see Kenny again. 
"
6 12 Stan "Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
"
6 12 Stan "Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
"
6 12 Stan "Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
"
6 12 Stan "We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
"
6 12 Stan "No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
"
6 12 Stan "No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
"
6 12 Stan "What??
"
6 12 Stan "Hey Kenny.
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
"
6 12 Stan "Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
"
6 12 Stan "No, we have to see Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "Cremated? What's that?
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!"
6 12 Stan "Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
"
6 12 Stan "Where??
"
6 12 Stan "Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
"
6 12 Stan "Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
"
6 12 Stan "Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
"
6 12 Stan "Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
"
6 12 Stan "Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, come back here! 
"
6 13 Stan "O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
"
6 13 Stan "You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
"
6 13 Stan "Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
"
6 13 Stan "How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
"
6 13 Stan "Good job, wizard.
"
6 13 Stan "My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
"
6 13 Stan "The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
"
6 13 Stan "We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
"
6 13 Stan "Woww.
"
6 13 Stan "We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
"
6 13 Stan "No, we have to return it! 
"
6 13 Stan "Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
"
6 13 Stan "Nothing.  Hey, kid!
"
6 13 Stan "Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
"
6 13 Stan "There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
"
6 13 Stan "Oh crap, dude!
"
6 13 Stan "Ogh. 
"
6 13 Stan "Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
"
6 13 Stan "We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Stan "Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
"
6 13 Stan "But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
"
6 13 Stan "Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
"
6 13 Stan "What do we do with it?
"
6 13 Stan "I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
"
6 13 Stan "No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
"
6 13 Stan "True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
"
6 13 Stan "Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
"
6 13 Stan "Jimmy didn't stop them!
"
6 13 Stan "Just get across the river! They're coming! 
"
6 13 Stan "Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
"
6 13 Stan "This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
"
6 13 Stan "Where?!
"
6 13 Stan "Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
"
6 13 Stan "Closed?
"
6 13 Stan "Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
"
6 13 Stan "They're coming!
"
6 13 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
6 13 Stan "Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
"
6 13 Stan "...Wow. 
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6 14 Stan "No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah, I have to remember that.
"
6 14 Stan "I guess.
"
6 14 Stan "Oh, no, no, no no no no.
"
6 14 Stan "Chef, we're intolerant. 
"
6 14 Stan "Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
"
6 14 Stan "Are we homophobes now?
"
6 14 Stan "N-no?
"
6 14 Stan "We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
"
6 14 Stan "Tolerance camp?
"
6 14 Stan "Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
"
6 14 Stan "The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
"
6 14 Stan "Butters!
"
6 14 Stan "Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
"
6 15 Stan "Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
"
6 15 Stan "Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
"
6 15 Stan "No, that's Kenny.
"
6 15 Stan "That's Cartman.
"
6 15 Stan "Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
"
6 15 Stan "Awesome!
"
6 15 Stan "Uh, over here please?
"
6 15 Stan "We told you that.
"
6 15 Stan "No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6 15 Stan "Heh hey wait a minute dude.
"
6 15 Stan "He seemed better on TV?
"
6 15 Stan "Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
"
6 15 Stan "We don't get to go to Scotland?
"
6 15 Stan "Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
"
6 15 Stan "That's us. Come on.
"
6 15 Stan "Huh?
"
6 15 Stan "Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
"
6 15 Stan "Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
"
6 15 Stan "What??
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 
"
6 15 Stan "Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
"
6 15 Stan "I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
"
6 15 Stan "Jesus Christ.
"
6 15 Stan "Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
"
6 15 Stan "Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
"
6 15 Stan "Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
"
6 15 Stan "Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
"
6 15 Stan "No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
"
6 15 Stan "No dude, you're a douche.
"
6 15 Stan "Then you're a stupid douche
"
6 15 Stan "I'm nine years old.
"
6 15 Stan "You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle! Kyle!
"
6 15 Stan "Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
"
6 15 Stan "No, he's not.
"
6 15 Stan "Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
"
6 15 Stan "Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
"
6 15 Stan "Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'""
"
6 15 Stan "See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
"
6 15 Stan "I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""
"
6 15 Stan "No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
"
6 15 Stan "What?! 
"
6 15 Stan "No wait.
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
"
6 15 Stan "No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""
"
6 15 Stan "Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"
6 15 Stan "I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""
"
6 15 Stan "Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!
"
6 15 Stan "Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
"
6 15 Stan "Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
"
6 15 Stan "No, I don't think either of us can. 
"
6 15 Stan "I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
"
6 15 Stan "Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
"
6 15 Stan "Fine, douche! 
"
6 15 Stan "No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
"
6 15 Stan "You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
"
6 15 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 15 Stan "There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
"
6 15 Stan "No, it can't be.
"
6 15 Stan "Oh, dude! 
"
6 15 Stan "Now do you people believe me?
"
6 16 Stan "What's going on?
"
6 16 Stan "So throw it away.
"
6 16 Stan "You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
"
6 16 Stan "It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
"
6 16 Stan "Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
"
6 16 Stan "Aw, come on, Mom.
"
6 16 Stan "It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
"
6 16 Stan "Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
"
6 16 Stan "I'm me from the past?
"
6 16 Stan "Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
"
6 16 Stan "What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
"
6 16 Stan "Stop it.
"
6 16 Stan "No.
"
6 16 Stan "Quit it.
"
6 16 Stan "Hey guys.
"
6 16 Stan "This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
"
6 16 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
6 16 Stan "God-damnit!
"
6 16 Stan "Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
"
6 16 Stan "I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
"
6 16 Stan "I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, how long has your future self been around?
"
6 16 Stan "Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
"
6 16 Stan "Where is he now?
"
6 16 Stan "Liver medicine?
"
6 16 Stan "Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
"
6 16 Stan "Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
"
6 16 Stan "Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
"
6 16 Stan "Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
"
6 16 Stan "What the hell is going on here?
"
6 16 Stan "I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
"
6 16 Stan "They've all been lying to us this whole time!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
"
6 16 Stan "They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
"
6 16 Stan "It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
"
6 16 Stan "Who's that?
"
6 16 Stan "What?
"
6 16 Stan "We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
"
6 16 Stan "...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
"
6 16 Stan "But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
"
6 16 Stan "No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
"
6 16 Stan "Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
"
6 16 Stan "Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
"
6 16 Stan "Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
"
6 16 Stan "Fine, then you can come with me. 
"
6 16 Stan "I guess this is it.
"
6 16 Stan "Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
"
6 16 Stan "Cartman??
"
6 16 Stan "What the hell are you doing here?!
"
6 16 Stan "God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
"
6 16 Stan "Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
"
6 16 Stan "How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
"
6 16 Stan "Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
"
6 16 Stan "How much is this going to cost us?
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 16 Stan "That's not neato, that sucks.
"
6 16 Stan "You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
"
6 16 Stan "Dude!
"
6 16 Stan "No, that's too extreme!
"
6 16 Stan "Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
"
6 16 Stan "Hey future self.
"
6 16 Stan "You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
"
6 16 Stan "You must know what I'm talking about.
"
6 16 Stan "Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
"
6 16 Stan "No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
"
6 16 Stan "What?
"
6 16 Stan "Hide and go seek, huh?!
"
6 16 Stan "I don't believe that he's my future self!
"
6 16 Stan "No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
"
6 16 Stan "But I have to know for sure. 
"
6 16 Stan "Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
"
6 16 Stan "Yes?
"
6 16 Stan "AAAH! 
"
6 16 Stan "That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
"
6 16 Stan "Butters!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, we're running away!
"
6 16 Stan "Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
"
6 16 Stan "Huh?
"
6 16 Stan "Get the fuck out of here. 
"
6 16 Stan "Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
"
6 16 Stan "I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
"
6 16 Stan "I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
"
6 17 Stan "Cartman, why are you doing this?
"
6 17 Stan "Wuh, that smells. 
"
6 17 Stan "Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
"
6 17 Stan "I don't know.
"
6 17 Stan "Awww! 
"
6 17 Stan "God, it took forever!
"
6 17 Stan "Hang on, Santa! 
"
6 17 Stan "Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
"
6 17 Stan "Oh no.
"
6 17 Stan "Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
"
6 17 Stan "I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
"
6 17 Stan "Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
"
6 17 Stan "We're here.
"
6 17 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
6 17 Stan "Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
"
6 17 Stan "Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
"
6 17 Stan "RPG, four o'clock!
"
6 17 Stan "We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"
6 17 Stan "Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
"
6 17 Stan "Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
"
6 17 Stan "Oh, hey Kenny.
"
6 17 Stan "Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
"
6 1 Stan "Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
"
6 1 Stan "Hey Kenny
"
6 1 Stan "We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
"
6 1 Stan "What kind of help?
"
6 1 Stan "I'll bet you can.
"
6 1 Stan "Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
"
6 1 Stan "Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
"
6 1 Stan "He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
"
6 1 Stan "You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
"
6 1 Stan "Marry him?
"
6 1 Stan "Chef, we need more food.
"
6 1 Stan "Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
"
6 1 Stan "How do you feel, Butters?
"
6 1 Stan "Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
"
6 1 Stan "We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
"
6 1 Stan "Did you bring the camera?
"
6 1 Stan "That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
"
6 1 Stan "Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
"
6 1 Stan "Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
"
6 1 Stan "All prepared for liposuction surgery?
"
6 1 Stan "Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
"
6 1 Stan "We've gotta hurry this up. 
"
6 1 Stan "He's losing weight. 
"
6 1 Stan "Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
"
6 1 Stan "Dude, bail! 
"
6 1 Stan "Come on, Butters. Time to go.
"
6 1 Stan "What?
"
6 1 Stan "...Kenny would have done it.
"
6 1 Stan "Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 
"
6 1 Stan "That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
"
6 1 Stan "What?!
"
6 1 Stan "Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
"
6 1 Stan "Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. 
"
6 1 Stan "No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
"
6 1 Stan "Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
"
6 1 Stan "Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
"
6 1 Stan "Oh God-damnit!
"
6 1 Stan "Why?
"
6 1 Stan "Well, so much for our money.
"
6 2 Stan "He's such a douchebag
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah, and then what?
"
6 2 Stan "They're still asleep.
"
6 2 Stan "What's a Hitler?
"
6 2 Stan "No, I never have.
"
6 2 Stan "Smell what?
"
6 2 Stan "Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
"
6 2 Stan "Uhh... no.
"
6 2 Stan "Stan. Marsh.
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I'm just learning.
"
6 2 Stan "I never said I was.
"
6 2 Stan "...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
"
6 2 Stan "Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
"
6 2 Stan "Oh no.
"
6 2 Stan "Heather? 
"
6 2 Stan "...who are you people?!
"
6 2 Stan "All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
"
6 2 Stan "Okay.
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah, prob'ly
"
6 2 Stan "Fries... fries...
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
"
6 2 Stan "Thanks. Who are you?
"
6 2 Stan "I' seems fine.
"
6 2 Stan "Don't care. 
"
6 2 Stan "I dunno.
"
6 2 Stan "Oh,. God. 
"
6 2 Stan "Gah, let's go you guys. 
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
"
6 2 Stan "I raced you, You won!
"
6 2 Stan "What?
"
6 2 Stan "I'll be there, you queen!
"
6 2 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "Dude, he's got Heather!
"
6 2 Stan "I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
"
6 2 Stan "...Thank you.
"
6 2 Stan "This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "That does it! I'm calling the police! 
"
6 2 Stan "Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
"
6 2 Stan "I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6 2 Stan "Pizza... pizza... pizza...
"
6 2 Stan "Thanks. 
"
6 2 Stan "Where the hell have you guys been?!
"
6 2 Stan "No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
"
6 3 Stan "Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"
6 3 Stan "Hey Kenny! 
"
6 3 Stan "Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
"
6 3 Stan "Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
"
6 3 Stan "What disease should we say?
"
6 3 Stan "What? 
"
6 3 Stan "This is gonna be so funny!
"
6 3 Stan "We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
"
6 3 Stan "It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
"
6 3 Stan "Kenny woulda done it. 
"
6 3 Stan "Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
"
6 3 Stan "Where's you get the balls from?
"
6 3 Stan "Wow!
"
6 3 Stan "All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
"
6 3 Stan "That's your flight, Butters.
"
6 3 Stan "Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
"
6 3 Stan "Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
"
6 3 Stan "Here he comes.
"
6 3 Stan "But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
"
6 3 Stan "Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
"
6 3 Stan "Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
"
6 3 Stan "I- told them where to find you.
"
6 3 Stan "Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
"
6 4 Stan "Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, I wouldn't have.
"
6 4 Stan "Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.
"
6 4 Stan "Pst, Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Cartman, wake up!
"
6 4 Stan "We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
"
6 4 Stan "So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
"
6 4 Stan "We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
"
6 4 Stan "Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
"
6 4 Stan "Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
"
6 4 Stan "Go on, dude it's the only way.
"
6 4 Stan "Just do it really fast, and we can go.
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
"
6 4 Stan "I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
"
6 4 Stan "Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
"
6 4 Stan "They aren't leaving.
"
6 4 Stan "Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
"
6 4 Stan "Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
"
6 4 Stan "I don't know.
"
6 4 Stan "We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
"
6 4 Stan "We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
"
6 4 Stan "Butters!  Did you bring it?
"
6 4 Stan "What?
"
6 4 Stan "Aw crap!
"
6 4 Stan "That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
"
6 4 Stan "They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
"
6 4 Stan "No!
"
6 4 Stan "You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
"
6 4 Stan "Kiss my ass!
"
6 4 Stan "I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
"
6 4 Stan "Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
"
6 4 Stan "Shut up, Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
"
6 4 Stan "Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
"
6 4 Stan "This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
"
6 4 Stan "Round one is over. We made it. 
"
6 4 Stan "Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
"
6 4 Stan "Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
"
6 4 Stan "We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
"
6 4 Stan "No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
"
6 4 Stan "Wait, what is that?  Dude!
"
6 4 Stan "See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
"
6 4 Stan "Wha? 
"
6 4 Stan "Dude, what are you guys doing?
"
6 4 Stan "You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
"
6 4 Stan "That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
"
6 4 Stan "No, this is exactly what we wanted.
"
6 4 Stan "Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
"
6 4 Stan "...I don't believe it.
"
6 4 Stan "Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
"
6 4 Stan "What are they doing here?
"
6 4 Stan "Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
"
6 4 Stan "No!
"
6 4 Stan "Hello?
"
6 4 Stan "Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
"
6 4 Stan "What do I say??
"
6 4 Stan "Cartman, no!
"
6 4 Stan "O-ogh...
"
6 4 Stan "It... did?
"
6 4 Stan "Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
"
6 4 Stan "We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
"
6 4 Stan "Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
"
6 5 Stan "This is gonna be so awesome!
"
6 5 Stan "Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
"
6 5 Stan "Alright, here we go.
"
6 5 Stan "Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
"
6 5 Stan "No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 
"
6 5 Stan "It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
"
6 5 Stan "But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
"
6 5 Stan "But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
"
6 5 Stan "Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
"
6 5 Stan "O-K, deal.
"
6 5 Stan "Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, I'm not going.
"
6 5 Stan "Stan.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
"
6 5 Stan "They look fine to me. 
"
6 5 Stan "That's worse!
"
6 5 Stan "Dude!
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, the commercials could start any time!
"
6 5 Stan "Get all the stuff! 
"
6 5 Stan "We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
"
6 5 Stan "Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
"
6 5 Stan "Huff, huff
"
6 5 Stan "Aww! 
"
6 5 Stan "AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
"
6 5 Stan "Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
"
6 5 Stan "We made it!
"
6 5 Stan "Here they come!
"
6 5 Stan "I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
"
6 5 Stan "Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
"
6 5 Stan "Oh God-dammit!
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 
"
6 5 Stan "The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
"
6 5 Stan "We made it.
"
6 5 Stan "But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
"
6 5 Stan "Commercial Break Number Two! 
"
6 5 Stan "I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
"
6 5 Stan "Oh, God, it's horrible! 
"
6 5 Stan "We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
"
6 5 Stan "Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
"
6 5 Stan "Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
"
6 5 Stan "She has to! 
"
6 5 Stan "Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
"
6 5 Stan "What?
"
6 5 Stan "The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
"
6 5 Stan "We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
"
6 5 Stan "Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
"
6 5 Stan "We made it! 
"
6 5 Stan "Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
"
6 5 Stan "Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!
"
6 5 Stan "That looks AWEsome! 
"
6 5 Stan "Oh, dude, let's go!
"
6 5 Stan "I wonder if it's all a western?
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, here he comes. 
"
6 6 Stan "Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
"
6 6 Stan "All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
"
6 6 Stan "So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
"
6 6 Stan "One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
"
6 6 Stan "All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, next? 
"
6 6 Stan "Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 
"
6 6 Stan "Shut up, fatass! 
"
6 6 Stan "I like it. 
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, let's try this. 
"
6 6 Stan "Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
"
6 6 Stan "Oh, this is giving me a headache.
"
6 6 Stan "You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
"
6 6 Stan "How about Token? 
"
6 6 Stan "That's great.
"
6 6 Stan "Suckup.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 
"
6 7 Stan "Just put it between his eyes.
"
6 7 Stan "Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
"
6 7 Stan "Oh, hey Butters.
"
6 7 Stan "Uh oh.
"
6 7 Stan "Alright, I'll chip in.
"
6 7 Stan "Ready. Let's see 'em.
"
6 7 Stan "Are they playing basketball? 
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
"
6 7 Stan "What are we gonna do with them?
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, that'd be funny.
"
6 7 Stan "Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
"
6 7 Stan "Oh jeez, change the channel.
"
6 7 Stan "They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
"
6 7 Stan "We're dead!
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
"
6 7 Stan "Chef, we did something kind of bad.
"
6 7 Stan "We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
"
6 7 Stan "We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
"
6 7 Stan "So what should we do? 
"
6 7 Stan "This is it.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, stupid.
"
6 7 Stan "Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
"
6 7 Stan "What do we do now?
"
6 7 Stan "Do you see the sea people.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 7 Stan "Aaah!
"
6 7 Stan "Let's go! 
"
6 7 Stan "The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
"
6 7 Stan "...and then we put them back in the tank.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 
"
6 7 Stan "Oh no, what now? 
"
6 7 Stan "Wow. How did that happen?
"
6 7 Stan "They've already accomplished so much.
"
6 7 Stan "Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
"
6 7 Stan "Well, drop them in! 
"
6 7 Stan "That's cool.
"
6 7 Stan "Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
"
6 7 Stan "...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
"
6 7 Stan "Hm.
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
"
6 7 Stan "Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
"
6 7 Stan "Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
"
6 7 Stan "The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
"
6 8 Stan "That sounds pretty fun.
"
6 8 Stan "What are they talking about?
"
6 8 Stan "Um, cool.
"
6 8 Stan "...Like ...money? What?
"
6 8 Stan "What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
"
6 8 Stan "We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
"
6 8 Stan "We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
"
6 8 Stan "Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
"
6 8 Stan "What?
"
6 8 Stan "Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
"
6 8 Stan "You've had five, dude!
"
6 8 Stan "Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
"
6 8 Stan "What? He did.
"
6 8 Stan "Yeah it does.
"
6 8 Stan "Yeah. It does. 
"
6 8 Stan "So?
"
6 8 Stan "Dude, look.
"
6 8 Stan "Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"
6 9 Stan "Oh, cool. A preview. 
"
6 9 Stan "Aw, dude, why would they do that?
"
6 9 Stan "That's gay. 
"
6 9 Stan "Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
"
6 9 Stan "Goddamnit, that pissed me off!
"
6 9 Stan "Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
"
6 9 Stan "We have to do something. Let's form a club.
"
6 9 Stan "No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
"
6 9 Stan "Well what's wrong with it?
"
6 9 Stan "Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
"
6 9 Stan "What?
"
6 9 Stan "Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
"
6 9 Stan "Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
"
6 9 Stan "Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
"
6 9 Stan "Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
"
6 9 Stan "You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
"
6 9 Stan "Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
"
6 9 Stan "Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
"
6 9 Stan "Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
"
6 9 Stan "...212, 213, 214 members!
"
6 9 Stan "Really? That's great.
"
6 9 Stan "If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
"
6 9 Stan "When did we do dibs for it?
"
6 9 Stan "Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
"
6 9 Stan "Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
"
6 9 Stan "That is our understanding.
"
6 9 Stan "It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
"
6 9 Stan "Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"
6 9 Stan "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
"
6 9 Stan "Okay, go. 
"
6 9 Stan "Over here! 
"
6 9 Stan "Aw, really?
"
6 9 Stan "Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"
6 9 Stan "So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song
"
6 9 Stan "Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
"
6 9 Stan "You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
"
6 9 Stan "Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
"
6 9 Stan "Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
"
6 9 Stan "He's definitely lost it
"
6 9 Stan "You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
"
6 9 Stan "Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
"
6 9 Stan "Yuh, you guys okay. 
"
6 9 Stan "Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
6 9 Stan "Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
"
6 9 Stan "Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
"
6 10 Stan "Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
"
6 10 Stan "Ah, hey, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
"
6 10 Stan "Hellafun
"
6 10 Stan "Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
"
6 10 Stan "So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "...Wait, what were we doing again?
"
6 10 Stan "Hey, that's what I wrote about!
"
6 10 Stan "Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
"
6 10 Stan "That's such a great paper! 
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 10 Stan "Uh huh.
"
6 10 Stan "That would be best.
"
6 10 Stan "Kyle??
"
6 10 Stan "Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
"
6 10 Stan "No!
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 10 Stan "Sure thing, Bebe.
"
6 10 Stan "Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
"
6 10 Stan "Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
"
6 10 Stan "Is Bebe home?
"
6 10 Stan "Cartman's?
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh! 
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! 
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh. Hoh?
"
6 10 Stan "Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
"
6 10 Stan "Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta. Ah, ahta!
"
6 10 Stan "Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahah
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta? 
"
6 10 Stan "Friend. Ahta.
"
6 10 Stan "Ahta! 
"
6 10 Stan "Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
"
6 10 Stan "Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
"
6 10 Stan "I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
"
6 11 Stan "I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
"
6 11 Stan "Child Tracker?
"
6 11 Stan "...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
"
6 11 Stan "I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
"
6 11 Stan "Huh?
"
6 11 Stan "But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
"
6 11 Stan "I'm not done with my pizza.
"
6 11 Stan "Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
"
6 11 Stan "But why do I have to leave?
"
6 11 Stan "Where are we supposed to go?
"
6 11 Stan "Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
"
6 11 Stan "Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 
"
6 11 Stan "Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
"
6 11 Stan "Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
"
6 11 Stan "Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
"
6 12 Stan "We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
"
6 12 Stan "Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
"
6 12 Stan "Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
"
6 12 Stan "We've gotta find that ticket!
"
6 12 Stan "You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
"
6 12 Stan "Where's Kenny??
"
6 12 Stan "Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
"
6 12 Stan "Did you get it? 
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
"
6 12 Stan "I can't see. 
"
6 12 Stan "It wa a trick!
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
"
6 12 Stan "We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
"
6 12 Stan "Cartman, come on!
"
6 12 Stan "Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
"
6 12 Stan "Because we wanna see Kenny again. 
"
6 12 Stan "Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
"
6 12 Stan "Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
"
6 12 Stan "Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
"
6 12 Stan "We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
"
6 12 Stan "No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
"
6 12 Stan "No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
"
6 12 Stan "What??
"
6 12 Stan "Hey Kenny.
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
"
6 12 Stan "Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
"
6 12 Stan "No, we have to see Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "Cremated? What's that?
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
"
6 12 Stan "Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
"
6 12 Stan "Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!"
6 12 Stan "Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
"
6 12 Stan "Where??
"
6 12 Stan "Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
"
6 12 Stan "Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
"
6 12 Stan "Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
"
6 12 Stan "Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
"
6 12 Stan "Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"
6 12 Stan "Dude, come back here! 
"
6 13 Stan "O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
"
6 13 Stan "You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
"
6 13 Stan "Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
"
6 13 Stan "How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
"
6 13 Stan "Good job, wizard.
"
6 13 Stan "My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
"
6 13 Stan "The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
"
6 13 Stan "We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
"
6 13 Stan "Woww.
"
6 13 Stan "We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
"
6 13 Stan "No, we have to return it! 
"
6 13 Stan "Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
"
6 13 Stan "Nothing.  Hey, kid!
"
6 13 Stan "Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
"
6 13 Stan "There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
"
6 13 Stan "Oh crap, dude!
"
6 13 Stan "Ogh. 
"
6 13 Stan "Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
"
6 13 Stan "We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Stan "Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
"
6 13 Stan "But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
"
6 13 Stan "Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
"
6 13 Stan "What do we do with it?
"
6 13 Stan "I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
"
6 13 Stan "No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
"
6 13 Stan "True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
"
6 13 Stan "Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
"
6 13 Stan "Jimmy didn't stop them!
"
6 13 Stan "Just get across the river! They're coming! 
"
6 13 Stan "Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
"
6 13 Stan "This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
"
6 13 Stan "Where?!
"
6 13 Stan "Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
"
6 13 Stan "Closed?
"
6 13 Stan "Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
"
6 13 Stan "They're coming!
"
6 13 Stan "Uh-oh.
"
6 13 Stan "Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
"
6 13 Stan "...Wow. 
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6 14 Stan "No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
"
6 14 Stan "Yeah, I have to remember that.
"
6 14 Stan "I guess.
"
6 14 Stan "Oh, no, no, no no no no.
"
6 14 Stan "Chef, we're intolerant. 
"
6 14 Stan "Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
"
6 14 Stan "Are we homophobes now?
"
6 14 Stan "N-no?
"
6 14 Stan "We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
"
6 14 Stan "Tolerance camp?
"
6 14 Stan "Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
"
6 14 Stan "The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
"
6 14 Stan "Butters!
"
6 14 Stan "Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
"
6 15 Stan "Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
"
6 15 Stan "Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
"
6 15 Stan "No, that's Kenny.
"
6 15 Stan "That's Cartman.
"
6 15 Stan "Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
"
6 15 Stan "Awesome!
"
6 15 Stan "Uh, over here please?
"
6 15 Stan "We told you that.
"
6 15 Stan "No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6 15 Stan "Heh hey wait a minute dude.
"
6 15 Stan "He seemed better on TV?
"
6 15 Stan "Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
"
6 15 Stan "We don't get to go to Scotland?
"
6 15 Stan "Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
"
6 15 Stan "That's us. Come on.
"
6 15 Stan "Huh?
"
6 15 Stan "Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
"
6 15 Stan "Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
"
6 15 Stan "What??
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 
"
6 15 Stan "Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
"
6 15 Stan "I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
"
6 15 Stan "Jesus Christ.
"
6 15 Stan "Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
"
6 15 Stan "Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
"
6 15 Stan "Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
"
6 15 Stan "Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
"
6 15 Stan "No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
"
6 15 Stan "No dude, you're a douche.
"
6 15 Stan "Then you're a stupid douche
"
6 15 Stan "I'm nine years old.
"
6 15 Stan "You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle! Kyle!
"
6 15 Stan "Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
"
6 15 Stan "Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
"
6 15 Stan "No, he's not.
"
6 15 Stan "Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
"
6 15 Stan "Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
"
6 15 Stan "Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'""
"
6 15 Stan "See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
"
6 15 Stan "I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""
"
6 15 Stan "No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
"
6 15 Stan "What?! 
"
6 15 Stan "No wait.
"
6 15 Stan "Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
"
6 15 Stan "No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""
"
6 15 Stan "Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"
6 15 Stan "I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""
"
6 15 Stan "Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!
"
6 15 Stan "Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
"
6 15 Stan "Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
"
6 15 Stan "No, I don't think either of us can. 
"
6 15 Stan "I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
"
6 15 Stan "Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
"
6 15 Stan "Fine, douche! 
"
6 15 Stan "No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
"
6 15 Stan "You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
"
6 15 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 15 Stan "There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
"
6 15 Stan "No, it can't be.
"
6 15 Stan "Oh, dude! 
"
6 15 Stan "Now do you people believe me?
"
6 16 Stan "What's going on?
"
6 16 Stan "So throw it away.
"
6 16 Stan "You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
"
6 16 Stan "It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
"
6 16 Stan "Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
"
6 16 Stan "Aw, come on, Mom.
"
6 16 Stan "It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
"
6 16 Stan "Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
"
6 16 Stan "I'm me from the past?
"
6 16 Stan "Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
"
6 16 Stan "What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
"
6 16 Stan "Stop it.
"
6 16 Stan "No.
"
6 16 Stan "Quit it.
"
6 16 Stan "Hey guys.
"
6 16 Stan "This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
"
6 16 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
6 16 Stan "God-damnit!
"
6 16 Stan "Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
"
6 16 Stan "I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
"
6 16 Stan "I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, how long has your future self been around?
"
6 16 Stan "Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
"
6 16 Stan "Where is he now?
"
6 16 Stan "Liver medicine?
"
6 16 Stan "Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
"
6 16 Stan "Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
"
6 16 Stan "Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
"
6 16 Stan "Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
"
6 16 Stan "What the hell is going on here?
"
6 16 Stan "I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
"
6 16 Stan "They've all been lying to us this whole time!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
"
6 16 Stan "They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
"
6 16 Stan "It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
"
6 16 Stan "Who's that?
"
6 16 Stan "What?
"
6 16 Stan "We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
"
6 16 Stan "...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
"
6 16 Stan "But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
"
6 16 Stan "No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
"
6 16 Stan "Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
"
6 16 Stan "Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
"
6 16 Stan "Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
"
6 16 Stan "Fine, then you can come with me. 
"
6 16 Stan "I guess this is it.
"
6 16 Stan "Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
"
6 16 Stan "Cartman??
"
6 16 Stan "What the hell are you doing here?!
"
6 16 Stan "God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
"
6 16 Stan "Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
"
6 16 Stan "How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
"
6 16 Stan "Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
"
6 16 Stan "How much is this going to cost us?
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah!
"
6 16 Stan "That's not neato, that sucks.
"
6 16 Stan "You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
"
6 16 Stan "Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
"
6 16 Stan "Dude!
"
6 16 Stan "No, that's too extreme!
"
6 16 Stan "Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
"
6 16 Stan "Hey future self.
"
6 16 Stan "You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
"
6 16 Stan "You must know what I'm talking about.
"
6 16 Stan "Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
"
6 16 Stan "No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
"
6 16 Stan "What?
"
6 16 Stan "Hide and go seek, huh?!
"
6 16 Stan "I don't believe that he's my future self!
"
6 16 Stan "No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
"
6 16 Stan "But I have to know for sure. 
"
6 16 Stan "Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
"
6 16 Stan "Yes?
"
6 16 Stan "AAAH! 
"
6 16 Stan "That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
"
6 16 Stan "Butters!
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
"
6 16 Stan "Butters, we're running away!
"
6 16 Stan "Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
"
6 16 Stan "Huh?
"
6 16 Stan "Get the fuck out of here. 
"
6 16 Stan "Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
"
6 16 Stan "I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
"
6 16 Stan "I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
"
6 16 Stan "Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
"
6 17 Stan "Cartman, why are you doing this?
"
6 17 Stan "Wuh, that smells. 
"
6 17 Stan "Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
"
6 17 Stan "I don't know.
"
6 17 Stan "Awww! 
"
6 17 Stan "God, it took forever!
"
6 17 Stan "Hang on, Santa! 
"
6 17 Stan "Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
"
6 17 Stan "Oh no.
"
6 17 Stan "Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
"
6 17 Stan "I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
"
6 17 Stan "Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
"
6 17 Stan "We're here.
"
6 17 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
6 17 Stan "Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
"
6 17 Stan "Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
"
6 17 Stan "RPG, four o'clock!
"
6 17 Stan "We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"
6 17 Stan "Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
"
6 17 Stan "Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
"
6 17 Stan "Oh, hey Kenny.
"
6 17 Stan "Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
