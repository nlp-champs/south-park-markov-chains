9 1 Cartman "This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
"
9 1 Cartman "Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
"
9 1 Cartman "Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
"
9 1 Cartman "You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
"
9 1 Cartman "He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
"
9 2 Cartman "Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
"
9 2 Cartman "Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 
"
9 2 Cartman "These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
"
9 2 Cartman "Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
"
9 2 Cartman "God damn hippie! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Get out of here!
"
9 2 Cartman "Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
"
9 2 Cartman "The college know-it-all hippies.
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, in you go.
"
9 2 Cartman "Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
"
9 2 Cartman "What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
"
9 2 Cartman "Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
"
9 2 Cartman "And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
"
9 2 Cartman "Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
"
9 2 Cartman "I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
"
9 2 Cartman "It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 
"
9 2 Cartman "I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
"
9 2 Cartman "It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
"
9 2 Cartman "What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 
"
9 2 Cartman "I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
"
9 2 Cartman "Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
"
9 2 Cartman "Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Everybody get in a single-file line!
"
9 2 Cartman "Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
"
9 2 Cartman "What?
"
9 2 Cartman "You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
"
9 2 Cartman "No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
"
9 2 Cartman "What did I do?!
"
9 2 Cartman "They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
"
9 2 Cartman "Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
"
9 2 Cartman "You... You what?
"
9 2 Cartman "They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
"
9 2 Cartman "You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
"
9 2 Cartman "How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
"
9 2 Cartman "Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
"
9 2 Cartman "Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
"
9 2 Cartman "Forget it. 
"
9 2 Cartman "It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
"
9 2 Cartman "Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
"
9 2 Cartman "I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
"
9 2 Cartman "In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
"
9 2 Cartman "We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
"
9 2 Cartman "Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 
"
9 2 Cartman "There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
"
9 2 Cartman "I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Primary engine running?
"
9 2 Cartman "Navigation systems?
"
9 2 Cartman "Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
"
9 2 Cartman "Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
"
9 2 Cartman "Come on, come on!
"
9 2 Cartman "No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
"
9 2 Cartman "...All right, fine Chef, go!
"
9 2 Cartman "Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
"
9 2 Cartman "You're the scientist, jackass!
"
9 2 Cartman "Put them in my laptop! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Hold it right there, Kyle! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
"
9 2 Cartman "Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
"
9 3 Cartman "Of course he sings. He's black.
"
9 3 Cartman "You wanna know what it is, guys?
"
9 3 Cartman "That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
"
9 3 Cartman "Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
"
9 3 Cartman "So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
"
9 3 Cartman "We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
"
9 3 Cartman "Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
"
9 3 Cartman "Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
"
9 3 Cartman "Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
"
9 3 Cartman "Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
"
9 3 Cartman "This will only take a second.
"
9 3 Cartman "Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
"
9 3 Cartman "Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
"
9 3 Cartman "I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
"
9 3 Cartman "I'm making it look like important people call us.
"
9 3 Cartman "...well Token doesn't know that.
"
9 3 Cartman "How?!
"
9 3 Cartman "Jew! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
"
9 3 Cartman "Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
"
9 3 Cartman "From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
"
9 3 Cartman "We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
"
9 3 Cartman "Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
"
9 3 Cartman "Sweet!
"
9 3 Cartman "You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, you signed with us!
"
9 3 Cartman "What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
"
9 3 Cartman "...Oooo...
"
9 3 Cartman "...Goddamnit! 
"
9 3 Cartman "This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
"
9 3 Cartman "You've ...already done all the work?
"
9 3 Cartman "We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Excuse us!
"
9 3 Cartman "Dude, how long is the wait?
"
9 3 Cartman "Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
"
9 3 Cartman "Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
"
9 3 Cartman "Stupid assholes! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
"
9 3 Cartman "Come on, Wing!
"
9 3 Cartman "She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Gay.
"
9 3 Cartman "Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Four thousand dollars? 
"
9 3 Cartman "That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let the dogs out?
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let the dogs out?
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let-?
"
9 3 Cartman "Naw, sh-she was with you!
"
9 3 Cartman "Wing? Wing?
"
9 3 Cartman "Wing? Here, Wing!
"
9 3 Cartman "Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
"
9 3 Cartman "Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
"
9 3 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
"
9 3 Cartman "Aw aw guys, come on!
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, you're... waiting tables?
"
9 3 Cartman "Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
"
9 4 Cartman "Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
"
9 4 Cartman "Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
"
9 4 Cartman "Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
"
9 4 Cartman "I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
"
9 4 Cartman "Kenny, when did you get here?
"
9 4 Cartman "Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
"
9 4 Cartman "Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
"
9 4 Cartman "YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
"
9 4 Cartman "JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!
"
9 4 Cartman "(looking bored) Fags!
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
"
9 4 Cartman "Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
"
9 4 Cartman "Yes!
"
9 4 Cartman "Well... well then he's NOT alive.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
"
9 4 Cartman "Um, it was um, this one time...
"
9 4 Cartman "Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
"
9 4 Cartman "Did so!
"
9 4 Cartman "Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
"
9 4 Cartman "You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
"
9 4 Cartman "I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
"
9 4 Cartman "He's right in here.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's right. Respect our authoritah.
"
9 4 Cartman "I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
"
9 4 Cartman "You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
"
9 4 Cartman "What?
"
9 5 Cartman "We're done! No more baseball!
"
9 5 Cartman "All right, we did it! 
"
9 5 Cartman "Post-season?
"
9 5 Cartman "Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
"
9 5 Cartman "All right, hit one out of the park!
"
9 5 Cartman "Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
"
9 5 Cartman "All right! 
"
9 5 Cartman "Ball. Balll. 
"
9 5 Cartman "That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
"
9 5 Cartman "What?!
"
9 5 Cartman "Aw Goddamnit! 
"
9 5 Cartman "How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
"
9 5 Cartman "What happens if we win the State Championship game?
"
9 5 Cartman "Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
"
9 5 Cartman "Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
"
9 5 Cartman "I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
"
9 5 Cartman "We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
"
9 6 Cartman "Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
"
9 6 Cartman "She's got Colonel!
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh boy!
"
9 6 Cartman "Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
"
9 6 Cartman "Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
"
9 6 Cartman "Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!
"
9 6 Cartman "No! No!!
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
"
9 6 Cartman "Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
"
9 6 Cartman "What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
"
9 6 Cartman "...What did you say?
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, and you can hear me??
"
9 6 Cartman "Because, Butters, I'm... dead. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
"
9 6 Cartman "I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
"
9 6 Cartman "I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters...
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters, you have to help me!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters.
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
"
9 6 Cartman "Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
"
9 6 Cartman "What do you mean?
"
9 6 Cartman "I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
"
9 6 Cartman "Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
"
9 6 Cartman "This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Tell her, tell her that I love her.
"
9 6 Cartman "Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
"
9 6 Cartman "It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
"
9 6 Cartman "Just the good times.
"
9 6 Cartman "I can't! Don't you understand?!
"
9 6 Cartman "God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
"
9 6 Cartman "G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
"
9 6 Cartman "What else do I have to do?!
"
9 6 Cartman "Atone?
"
9 6 Cartman "Not really...
"
9 6 Cartman "Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
"
9 6 Cartman "I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
"
9 6 Cartman "Really?
"
9 6 Cartman "I know how.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
"
9 6 Cartman "Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
"
9 6 Cartman "I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
"
9 6 Cartman "I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
"
9 6 Cartman "She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
"
9 6 Cartman "I told you, Butters. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't worry. I have a plan. 
"
9 6 Cartman "They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Yes, it's working! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
"
9 6 Cartman "My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
"
9 6 Cartman "We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
"
9 6 Cartman "Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
"
9 6 Cartman "You sonofabitch Butters!
"
9 6 Cartman "You told me I was a ghost!
"
9 6 Cartman "How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
"
9 7 Cartman "Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
"
9 7 Cartman "No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
"
9 7 Cartman "Up yours, Butters.
"
9 7 Cartman "Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
"
9 7 Cartman "Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
"
9 7 Cartman "Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
"
9 7 Cartman "I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
"
9 7 Cartman "Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
"
9 7 Cartman "Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
"
9 7 Cartman "Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""
"
9 7 Cartman "All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.""
"
9 7 Cartman "All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""
"
9 7 Cartman "Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
"
9 7 Cartman "Aaagh!
"
9 7 Cartman "D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
"
9 8 Cartman "Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
"
9 8 Cartman "You know how?
"
9 8 Cartman "Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
"
9 8 Cartman "Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
"
9 8 Cartman "Awesome.
"
9 8 Cartman "We're not moving.
"
9 8 Cartman "Maybe you have the parking brake on.
"
9 8 Cartman "Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
"
9 8 Cartman "Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
"
9 8 Cartman "I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
"
9 8 Cartman "Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Yeah.
"
9 8 Cartman "Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
"
9 8 Cartman "Well they should've gotten out of there!
"
9 8 Cartman "We did!
"
9 8 Cartman "Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
"
9 8 Cartman "Hngh, totally.
"
9 8 Cartman "Aw crap!
"
9 8 Cartman "Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
"
9 8 Cartman "Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
"
9 8 Cartman "Why?
"
9 8 Cartman "Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.""
"
9 8 Cartman "Help! Help! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Not so fast, Kyle.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hand over the gold!
"
9 8 Cartman "You know what I'm talkng about!
"
9 8 Cartman "All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
"
9 8 Cartman "I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
"
9 8 Cartman "Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
"
9 8 Cartman "I want... your Jew gold! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 
"
9 8 Cartman "...Aw man.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
"
9 9 Cartman "Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
"
9 9 Cartman "What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
"
9 9 Cartman "Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
"
9 9 Cartman "Video playback initialized. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
"
9 9 Cartman "How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
"
9 9 Cartman "Good man. Any luck here?
"
9 9 Cartman "Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
"
9 9 Cartman "Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
"
9 9 Cartman "Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
"
9 9 Cartman "No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
"
9 9 Cartman "No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
"
9 9 Cartman "Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
"
9 9 Cartman "Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Okay. One! Two! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Nice.
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
"
9 9 Cartman "Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
"
9 9 Cartman "God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
"
9 9 Cartman "That son of a bitch!
"
9 9 Cartman "Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
9 9 Cartman "You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
"
9 9 Cartman "Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
"
9 9 Cartman "Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
"
9 9 Cartman "No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
"
9 9 Cartman "Because I do, Clyde.
"
9 9 Cartman "I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
"
9 9 Cartman "Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
"
9 9 Cartman "Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
"
9 9 Cartman "Think of the power!
"
9 9 Cartman "Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
"
9 9 Cartman "Damn, Ken.
"
9 10 Cartman "I broke the egg.
"
9 10 Cartman "I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
"
9 10 Cartman "...No.
"
9 10 Cartman "No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
"
9 10 Cartman "Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
"
9 10 Cartman "Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
"
9 10 Cartman "...Why are you doing this?
"
9 10 Cartman "What do you want from me?
"
9 10 Cartman "...No.
"
9 10 Cartman "Yes teacher.
"
9 11 Cartman "Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
"
9 11 Cartman "Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.
"
9 11 Cartman "I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" 
"
9 11 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
"
9 11 Cartman "Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
"
9 11 Cartman "Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
"
9 11 Cartman "-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
"
9 11 Cartman "I'M GINGER!
"
9 11 Cartman "Help me! Hellp mee!
"
9 11 Cartman "And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
"
9 11 Cartman "So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
"
9 11 Cartman "Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!
"
9 11 Cartman "Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
"
9 11 Cartman "Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
"
9 11 Cartman "What do you mean, Kyle?
"
9 11 Cartman "Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
"
9 11 Cartman "That's fine, just get it out of the way...
"
9 11 Cartman "Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 
"
9 11 Cartman "I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
"
9 11 Cartman "Huh?
"
9 11 Cartman "But... it's me.
"
9 11 Cartman "Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
"
9 11 Cartman "I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
"
9 11 Cartman "Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
"
9 11 Cartman "...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...
"
9 11 Cartman "Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
"
9 11 Cartman "Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power! 
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Better red than dead!
"
9 11 Cartman "Better red than dead!
"
9 11 Cartman "That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
"
9 11 Cartman "The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
"
9 11 Cartman "There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
"
9 11 Cartman "Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
"
9 11 Cartman "Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
"
9 11 Cartman "Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
"
9 11 Cartman "We're fine, thanks.
"
9 11 Cartman "We're fine!
"
9 11 Cartman "You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
"
9 11 Cartman "Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
"
9 11 Cartman "My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
"
9 11 Cartman "What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
"
9 11 Cartman "No, we're fine! Thank you!
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes! We're good!
"
9 11 Cartman "You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
"
9 11 Cartman "Go on then! Say your last words!
"
9 11 Cartman "Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
"
9 11 Cartman "Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
"
9 11 Cartman "D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
"
9 11 Cartman "Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
"
9 11 Cartman "See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
"
9 11 Cartman "... Huh?
"
9 11 Cartman "Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
"
9 11 Cartman "No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
"
9 11 Cartman "That's it! You've got it!
"
9 11 Cartman "Live together!
"
9 11 Cartman "The same, you and I!
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
"
9 12 Cartman "Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
"
9 12 Cartman "HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
"
9 12 Cartman "Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
"
9 12 Cartman "Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
"
9 12 Cartman "Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
"
9 12 Cartman "Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
"
9 13 Cartman "I'm all wet! Sweet!
"
9 13 Cartman "Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
"
9 13 Cartman "Yes! Yeehehehes! 
"
9 13 Cartman "I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
"
9 13 Cartman "Why?
"
9 13 Cartman "Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
"
9 13 Cartman "Killer. 
"
9 13 Cartman "Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
"
9 13 Cartman "Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
"
9 13 Cartman "Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
"
9 13 Cartman "Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
"
9 13 Cartman "You live on the moon?
"
9 13 Cartman "Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
"
9 13 Cartman "Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
"
9 13 Cartman "He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
"
9 13 Cartman "Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
"
9 13 Cartman "We have to hurry!
"
9 13 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
9 13 Cartman "Oh crap! There's more of them! 
"
9 13 Cartman "Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 
"
9 14 Cartman "Ichi banzai
"
9 14 Cartman "Ichi banzai! Kya!
"
9 14 Cartman "I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.
"
9 14 Cartman "Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
"
9 14 Cartman "Yeah, let's go.
"
9 14 Cartman "Dude, what the hell is he doing?
"
9 14 Cartman "You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
"
9 14 Cartman "Man, that was such a bummer.
"
9 14 Cartman "Why?
"
9 14 Cartman "All right, Stan. Sure. 
"
9 1 Cartman "This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
"
9 1 Cartman "Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
"
9 1 Cartman "Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
"
9 1 Cartman "You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
"
9 1 Cartman "He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
"
9 2 Cartman "Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
"
9 2 Cartman "Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 
"
9 2 Cartman "These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
"
9 2 Cartman "Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
"
9 2 Cartman "God damn hippie! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Get out of here!
"
9 2 Cartman "Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
"
9 2 Cartman "The college know-it-all hippies.
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, in you go.
"
9 2 Cartman "Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
"
9 2 Cartman "What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
"
9 2 Cartman "Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
"
9 2 Cartman "And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
"
9 2 Cartman "Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
"
9 2 Cartman "I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
"
9 2 Cartman "It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 
"
9 2 Cartman "I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
"
9 2 Cartman "It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
"
9 2 Cartman "What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 
"
9 2 Cartman "I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
"
9 2 Cartman "Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
"
9 2 Cartman "Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Everybody get in a single-file line!
"
9 2 Cartman "Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
"
9 2 Cartman "What?
"
9 2 Cartman "You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
"
9 2 Cartman "No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
"
9 2 Cartman "What did I do?!
"
9 2 Cartman "They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
"
9 2 Cartman "Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
"
9 2 Cartman "You... You what?
"
9 2 Cartman "They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
"
9 2 Cartman "You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
"
9 2 Cartman "How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
"
9 2 Cartman "Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
"
9 2 Cartman "Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
"
9 2 Cartman "Forget it. 
"
9 2 Cartman "It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
"
9 2 Cartman "Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
"
9 2 Cartman "I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
"
9 2 Cartman "Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
"
9 2 Cartman "In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
"
9 2 Cartman "We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
"
9 2 Cartman "Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
"
9 2 Cartman "All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 
"
9 2 Cartman "There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
"
9 2 Cartman "I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
"
9 2 Cartman "Primary engine running?
"
9 2 Cartman "Navigation systems?
"
9 2 Cartman "Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
"
9 2 Cartman "Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
"
9 2 Cartman "Come on, come on!
"
9 2 Cartman "No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
"
9 2 Cartman "...All right, fine Chef, go!
"
9 2 Cartman "Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
"
9 2 Cartman "You're the scientist, jackass!
"
9 2 Cartman "Put them in my laptop! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Hold it right there, Kyle! 
"
9 2 Cartman "Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
"
9 2 Cartman "Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
"
9 3 Cartman "Of course he sings. He's black.
"
9 3 Cartman "You wanna know what it is, guys?
"
9 3 Cartman "That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
"
9 3 Cartman "Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
"
9 3 Cartman "So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
"
9 3 Cartman "We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
"
9 3 Cartman "Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
"
9 3 Cartman "Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
"
9 3 Cartman "Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
"
9 3 Cartman "Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
"
9 3 Cartman "This will only take a second.
"
9 3 Cartman "Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
"
9 3 Cartman "Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
"
9 3 Cartman "I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
"
9 3 Cartman "I'm making it look like important people call us.
"
9 3 Cartman "...well Token doesn't know that.
"
9 3 Cartman "How?!
"
9 3 Cartman "Jew! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
"
9 3 Cartman "Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
"
9 3 Cartman "From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
"
9 3 Cartman "We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
"
9 3 Cartman "Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
"
9 3 Cartman "Sweet!
"
9 3 Cartman "You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, you signed with us!
"
9 3 Cartman "What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
"
9 3 Cartman "...Oooo...
"
9 3 Cartman "...Goddamnit! 
"
9 3 Cartman "This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
"
9 3 Cartman "You've ...already done all the work?
"
9 3 Cartman "We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Excuse us!
"
9 3 Cartman "Dude, how long is the wait?
"
9 3 Cartman "Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
"
9 3 Cartman "Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
"
9 3 Cartman "Stupid assholes! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
"
9 3 Cartman "Come on, Wing!
"
9 3 Cartman "She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Gay.
"
9 3 Cartman "Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Four thousand dollars? 
"
9 3 Cartman "That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let the dogs out?
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let the dogs out?
"
9 3 Cartman "Who let-?
"
9 3 Cartman "Naw, sh-she was with you!
"
9 3 Cartman "Wing? Wing?
"
9 3 Cartman "Wing? Here, Wing!
"
9 3 Cartman "Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
"
9 3 Cartman "Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
"
9 3 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
"
9 3 Cartman "Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
"
9 3 Cartman "Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
"
9 3 Cartman "Aw aw guys, come on!
"
9 3 Cartman "Token, you're... waiting tables?
"
9 3 Cartman "Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
"
9 4 Cartman "Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
"
9 4 Cartman "Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
"
9 4 Cartman "Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
"
9 4 Cartman "I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
"
9 4 Cartman "Kenny, when did you get here?
"
9 4 Cartman "Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
"
9 4 Cartman "Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
"
9 4 Cartman "YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
"
9 4 Cartman "JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!
"
9 4 Cartman "(looking bored) Fags!
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
"
9 4 Cartman "Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
"
9 4 Cartman "Yes!
"
9 4 Cartman "Well... well then he's NOT alive.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
"
9 4 Cartman "Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
"
9 4 Cartman "Um, it was um, this one time...
"
9 4 Cartman "Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
"
9 4 Cartman "Did so!
"
9 4 Cartman "Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
"
9 4 Cartman "You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
"
9 4 Cartman "I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
"
9 4 Cartman "He's right in here.
"
9 4 Cartman "That's right. Respect our authoritah.
"
9 4 Cartman "I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
"
9 4 Cartman "You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
"
9 4 Cartman "What?
"
9 5 Cartman "We're done! No more baseball!
"
9 5 Cartman "All right, we did it! 
"
9 5 Cartman "Post-season?
"
9 5 Cartman "Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
"
9 5 Cartman "All right, hit one out of the park!
"
9 5 Cartman "Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
"
9 5 Cartman "All right! 
"
9 5 Cartman "Ball. Balll. 
"
9 5 Cartman "That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
"
9 5 Cartman "What?!
"
9 5 Cartman "Aw Goddamnit! 
"
9 5 Cartman "How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
"
9 5 Cartman "What happens if we win the State Championship game?
"
9 5 Cartman "Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
"
9 5 Cartman "Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
"
9 5 Cartman "I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
"
9 5 Cartman "We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
"
9 6 Cartman "Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
"
9 6 Cartman "She's got Colonel!
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh boy!
"
9 6 Cartman "Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
"
9 6 Cartman "Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
"
9 6 Cartman "Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!
"
9 6 Cartman "No! No!!
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
"
9 6 Cartman "Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
"
9 6 Cartman "What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
"
9 6 Cartman "...What did you say?
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, and you can hear me??
"
9 6 Cartman "Because, Butters, I'm... dead. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
"
9 6 Cartman "I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
"
9 6 Cartman "I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters...
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters, you have to help me!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters.
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
"
9 6 Cartman "Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
"
9 6 Cartman "What do you mean?
"
9 6 Cartman "I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
"
9 6 Cartman "Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
"
9 6 Cartman "This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Tell her, tell her that I love her.
"
9 6 Cartman "Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
"
9 6 Cartman "It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
"
9 6 Cartman "Just the good times.
"
9 6 Cartman "I can't! Don't you understand?!
"
9 6 Cartman "God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
"
9 6 Cartman "G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
"
9 6 Cartman "What else do I have to do?!
"
9 6 Cartman "Atone?
"
9 6 Cartman "Not really...
"
9 6 Cartman "Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
"
9 6 Cartman "I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
"
9 6 Cartman "Really?
"
9 6 Cartman "I know how.
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
"
9 6 Cartman "Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
"
9 6 Cartman "I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
"
9 6 Cartman "Butters.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
"
9 6 Cartman "I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
"
9 6 Cartman "She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
"
9 6 Cartman "I told you, Butters. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
"
9 6 Cartman "All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
"
9 6 Cartman "Don't worry. I have a plan. 
"
9 6 Cartman "They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
"
9 6 Cartman "Yes, it's working! 
"
9 6 Cartman "Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
"
9 6 Cartman "My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
"
9 6 Cartman "We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
"
9 6 Cartman "Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
"
9 6 Cartman "You sonofabitch Butters!
"
9 6 Cartman "You told me I was a ghost!
"
9 6 Cartman "How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
"
9 7 Cartman "Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
"
9 7 Cartman "No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
"
9 7 Cartman "Up yours, Butters.
"
9 7 Cartman "Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
"
9 7 Cartman "Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
"
9 7 Cartman "Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
"
9 7 Cartman "I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
"
9 7 Cartman "Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
"
9 7 Cartman "Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
"
9 7 Cartman "Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""
"
9 7 Cartman "All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.""
"
9 7 Cartman "All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""
"
9 7 Cartman "Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
"
9 7 Cartman "Aaagh!
"
9 7 Cartman "D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
"
9 8 Cartman "Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
"
9 8 Cartman "You know how?
"
9 8 Cartman "Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
"
9 8 Cartman "Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
"
9 8 Cartman "Awesome.
"
9 8 Cartman "We're not moving.
"
9 8 Cartman "Maybe you have the parking brake on.
"
9 8 Cartman "Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
"
9 8 Cartman "Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
"
9 8 Cartman "I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
"
9 8 Cartman "Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Yeah.
"
9 8 Cartman "Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
"
9 8 Cartman "Well they should've gotten out of there!
"
9 8 Cartman "We did!
"
9 8 Cartman "Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
"
9 8 Cartman "Hngh, totally.
"
9 8 Cartman "Aw crap!
"
9 8 Cartman "Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
"
9 8 Cartman "Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
"
9 8 Cartman "Why?
"
9 8 Cartman "Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.""
"
9 8 Cartman "Help! Help! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Not so fast, Kyle.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hand over the gold!
"
9 8 Cartman "You know what I'm talkng about!
"
9 8 Cartman "All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
"
9 8 Cartman "I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
"
9 8 Cartman "Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
"
9 8 Cartman "I want... your Jew gold! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
"
9 8 Cartman "Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 
"
9 8 Cartman "...Aw man.
"
9 8 Cartman "Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
"
9 9 Cartman "Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
"
9 9 Cartman "What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
"
9 9 Cartman "Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
"
9 9 Cartman "Video playback initialized. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
"
9 9 Cartman "How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
"
9 9 Cartman "Good man. Any luck here?
"
9 9 Cartman "Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
"
9 9 Cartman "Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
"
9 9 Cartman "Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
"
9 9 Cartman "No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
"
9 9 Cartman "No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
"
9 9 Cartman "Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
"
9 9 Cartman "Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Okay. One! Two! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Nice.
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
"
9 9 Cartman "Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
"
9 9 Cartman "Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
"
9 9 Cartman "God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
"
9 9 Cartman "That son of a bitch!
"
9 9 Cartman "Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
9 9 Cartman "You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
"
9 9 Cartman "Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
"
9 9 Cartman "Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
"
9 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
"
9 9 Cartman "No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
"
9 9 Cartman "Because I do, Clyde.
"
9 9 Cartman "I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
"
9 9 Cartman "Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
"
9 9 Cartman "Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
"
9 9 Cartman "Think of the power!
"
9 9 Cartman "Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
"
9 9 Cartman "Damn, Ken.
"
9 10 Cartman "I broke the egg.
"
9 10 Cartman "I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
"
9 10 Cartman "...No.
"
9 10 Cartman "No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
"
9 10 Cartman "Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
"
9 10 Cartman "Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
"
9 10 Cartman "...Why are you doing this?
"
9 10 Cartman "What do you want from me?
"
9 10 Cartman "...No.
"
9 10 Cartman "Yes teacher.
"
9 11 Cartman "Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
"
9 11 Cartman "Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.
"
9 11 Cartman "I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" 
"
9 11 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
"
9 11 Cartman "Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
"
9 11 Cartman "Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
"
9 11 Cartman "-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
"
9 11 Cartman "I'M GINGER!
"
9 11 Cartman "Help me! Hellp mee!
"
9 11 Cartman "And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
"
9 11 Cartman "So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
"
9 11 Cartman "Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!
"
9 11 Cartman "Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
"
9 11 Cartman "Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
"
9 11 Cartman "What do you mean, Kyle?
"
9 11 Cartman "Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
"
9 11 Cartman "That's fine, just get it out of the way...
"
9 11 Cartman "Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 
"
9 11 Cartman "I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
"
9 11 Cartman "Huh?
"
9 11 Cartman "But... it's me.
"
9 11 Cartman "Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
"
9 11 Cartman "I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
"
9 11 Cartman "Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
"
9 11 Cartman "...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...
"
9 11 Cartman "Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
"
9 11 Cartman "Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power! 
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Red Power!
"
9 11 Cartman "Better red than dead!
"
9 11 Cartman "Better red than dead!
"
9 11 Cartman "That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
"
9 11 Cartman "The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
"
9 11 Cartman "There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
"
9 11 Cartman "Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
"
9 11 Cartman "Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
"
9 11 Cartman "Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
"
9 11 Cartman "We're fine, thanks.
"
9 11 Cartman "We're fine!
"
9 11 Cartman "You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
"
9 11 Cartman "Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
"
9 11 Cartman "My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
"
9 11 Cartman "What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
"
9 11 Cartman "No, we're fine! Thank you!
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes! We're good!
"
9 11 Cartman "You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
"
9 11 Cartman "Go on then! Say your last words!
"
9 11 Cartman "Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
"
9 11 Cartman "Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
"
9 11 Cartman "D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
"
9 11 Cartman "Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
"
9 11 Cartman "See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
"
9 11 Cartman "... Huh?
"
9 11 Cartman "Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
"
9 11 Cartman "No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
"
9 11 Cartman "That's it! You've got it!
"
9 11 Cartman "Live together!
"
9 11 Cartman "The same, you and I!
"
9 11 Cartman "Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
"
9 12 Cartman "Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
"
9 12 Cartman "HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
"
9 12 Cartman "Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
"
9 12 Cartman "Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
"
9 12 Cartman "Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
"
9 12 Cartman "Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
"
9 13 Cartman "I'm all wet! Sweet!
"
9 13 Cartman "Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
"
9 13 Cartman "Yes! Yeehehehes! 
"
9 13 Cartman "I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
"
9 13 Cartman "Why?
"
9 13 Cartman "Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
"
9 13 Cartman "Killer. 
"
9 13 Cartman "Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
"
9 13 Cartman "Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
"
9 13 Cartman "Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
"
9 13 Cartman "Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
"
9 13 Cartman "You live on the moon?
"
9 13 Cartman "Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
"
9 13 Cartman "Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
"
9 13 Cartman "He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
"
9 13 Cartman "Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
"
9 13 Cartman "We have to hurry!
"
9 13 Cartman "Uh oh.
"
9 13 Cartman "Oh crap! There's more of them! 
"
9 13 Cartman "Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 
"
9 14 Cartman "Ichi banzai
"
9 14 Cartman "Ichi banzai! Kya!
"
9 14 Cartman "I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.
"
9 14 Cartman "Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
"
9 14 Cartman "Yeah, let's go.
"
9 14 Cartman "Dude, what the hell is he doing?
"
9 14 Cartman "You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
"
9 14 Cartman "Man, that was such a bummer.
"
9 14 Cartman "Why?
"
9 14 Cartman "All right, Stan. Sure. 
"
