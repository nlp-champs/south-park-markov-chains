And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
17 1 Butters "Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
"
17 1 Butters "Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?
"
17 1 Butters "Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?

17 1 Butters "Sure, I love the Truth.
"
17 1 Butters "Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
"
17 1 Butters "Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"
17 1 Butters "Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
"
17 1 Butters "Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"
17 1 Butters "Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
"
17 1 Butters "Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17 1 Butters "We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
17 1 Butters "Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
"
17 1 Butters "Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"
17 1 Butters "Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
"
17 1 Butters "Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
"
17 1 Butters "I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
17 1 Butters "Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17 1 Butters "It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"
17 1 Butters "Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
17 1 Butters "Yes.
"
17 1 Butters "Yes!
"
17 1 Butters "That's right.
"
17 1 Butters "We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
"
17 1 Butters "Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
"
17 1 Butters "Hallelujah!
"
17 2 Butters "Murder porn?
"
17 2 Butters "I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
"
17 2 Butters "I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!
"
17 2 Butters "Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
"
17 2 Butters "I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
"
17 2 Butters "Huh?
"
17 3 Butters "Yes.
"
17 3 Butters "Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
"
17 3 Butters "Holy Moly.
"
17 3 Butters "Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
"
17 5 Butters "Heheh, yeah. 
"
17 6 Butters "Whoa, look at it!
"
17 6 Butters "Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
"
17 6 Butters "Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
"
17 6 Butters "Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
"
17 6 Butters "Busted!
"
17 6 Butters "Just stop, please.
"
17 7 Butters "Woo, spooky.
"
17 7 Butters "Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
"
17 7 Butters "Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
"
17 7 Butters "Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
"
17 7 Butters "Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
"
17 7 Butters "Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
"
17 7 Butters "Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
"
17 7 Butters "Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
"
17 7 Butters "I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
"
17 8 Butters "Yeah!
"
17 8 Butters "You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
"
17 8 Butters "They don't!
"
17 8 Butters "Yeah, I finished it!
"
17 8 Butters "Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
"
17 8 Butters "Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
17 8 Butters "Who's George R. R. Martin?
"
17 8 Butters "Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
"
17 8 Butters "Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"
17 8 Butters "Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"
17 8 Butters "Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
"
17 8 Butters "We're not fans!
"
17 8 Butters "We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
17 8 Butters "Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
"
17 8 Butters "Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
"
17 8 Butters "When?
"
17 8 Butters "Please. It's urgent.

17 8 Butters "No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
"
17 8 Butters "Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
17 8 Butters "He's diabetic.
"
17 8 Butters "Oh. Okay, thanks.
"
17 8 Butters "OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
"
17 8 Butters "But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"
17 8 Butters "Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
17 8 Butters "What kind do we want?!
"
17 8 Butters "Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
"
17 8 Butters "NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
"
17 8 Butters "Whatoyou mean?
"
17 9 Butters "Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
"
17 9 Butters "What's that?  Awww! 
"
17 9 Butters "Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
"
17 9 Butters "The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"
17 9 Butters "Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!

17 10 Butters "So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-

17 10 Butters "Oh. Yes?

17 10 Butters "Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
"
17 10 Butters "Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"
17 10 Butters "I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
"
17 10 Butters "You're a liar!
"
17 10 Butters "You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh, she said it again!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
17 10 Butters "Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream!

17 10 Butters "Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
17 10 Butters "II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.

17 10 Butters "You're a liar!
"
17 10 Butters "You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh, she said it again!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
17 10 Butters "Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
"
17 10 Butters "Okay.
"
17 10 Butters "That's Lisa Berger?
"
17 10 Butters "She's pretty!
"
17 10 Butters "Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
"
17 10 Butters "And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
"
17 10 Butters "Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
17 10 Butters "II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
"
17 10 Butters "What?! Well since when?
"
17 10 Butters "No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
"
17 10 Butters "I do love water balloons. 
"
17 1 Butters "Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
"
17 1 Butters "The government watches everything we do?
"
17 1 Butters "Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
17 1 Butters "Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
"
17 1 Butters "Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?
"
17 1 Butters "Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?
"
17 1 Butters "Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
"
17 1 Butters "Sure, I love the Truth.
"
17 1 Butters "Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
"
17 1 Butters "Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"
17 1 Butters "Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
"
17 1 Butters "Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"
17 1 Butters "Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
"
17 1 Butters "Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17 1 Butters "We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
17 1 Butters "Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
"
17 1 Butters "Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"
17 1 Butters "Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
"
17 1 Butters "Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
"
17 1 Butters "I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
17 1 Butters "Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17 1 Butters "It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
"
17 1 Butters "It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"
17 1 Butters "Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
17 1 Butters "Yes.
"
17 1 Butters "Yes!
"
17 1 Butters "That's right.
"
17 1 Butters "We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
"
17 1 Butters "Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
"
17 1 Butters "Hallelujah!
"
17 2 Butters "Murder porn?
"
17 2 Butters "I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
"
17 2 Butters "I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!
"
17 2 Butters "Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
"
17 2 Butters "I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
"
17 2 Butters "Huh?
"
17 3 Butters "Yes.
"
17 3 Butters "Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
"
17 3 Butters "Holy Moly.
"
17 3 Butters "Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
"
17 5 Butters "Heheh, yeah. 
"
17 6 Butters "Whoa, look at it!
"
17 6 Butters "Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
"
17 6 Butters "Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
"
17 6 Butters "Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
"
17 6 Butters "Busted!
"
17 6 Butters "Just stop, please.
"
17 7 Butters "Woo, spooky.
"
17 7 Butters "Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
"
17 7 Butters "Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
"
17 7 Butters "Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
"
17 7 Butters "Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
"
17 7 Butters "Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
"
17 7 Butters "Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
"
17 7 Butters "Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
"
17 7 Butters "I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
"
17 8 Butters "Yeah!
"
17 8 Butters "You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
"
17 8 Butters "They don't!
"
17 8 Butters "Yeah, I finished it!
"
17 8 Butters "Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
"
17 8 Butters "Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
17 8 Butters "Who's George R. R. Martin?
"
17 8 Butters "Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
"
17 8 Butters "Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"
17 8 Butters "Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"
17 8 Butters "Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
"
17 8 Butters "We're not fans!
"
17 8 Butters "We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
17 8 Butters "Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
"
17 8 Butters "Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
"
17 8 Butters "When?
"
17 8 Butters "Please. It's urgent.
"
17 8 Butters "No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
"
17 8 Butters "Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
17 8 Butters "He's diabetic.
"
17 8 Butters "Oh. Okay, thanks.
"
17 8 Butters "OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
"
17 8 Butters "But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"
17 8 Butters "Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
17 8 Butters "What kind do we want?!
"
17 8 Butters "Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
"
17 8 Butters "NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
"
17 8 Butters "Whatoyou mean?
"
17 9 Butters "Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
"
17 9 Butters "What's that?  Awww! 
"
17 9 Butters "Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
"
17 9 Butters "The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"
17 9 Butters "Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
"
17 10 Butters "So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-
"
17 10 Butters "Oh. Yes?
"
17 10 Butters "Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
"
17 10 Butters "See ya, Lisa! 
"
17 10 Butters "Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
"
17 10 Butters "Oh. Hey Wendy.
"
17 10 Butters "Am I just an asshole?
"
17 10 Butters "Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
"
17 10 Butters "Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
"
17 10 Butters "Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"
17 10 Butters "I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
"
17 10 Butters "You're a liar!
"
17 10 Butters "You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh, she said it again!
"
17 10 Butters "Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
17 10 Butters "Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
"
17 10 Butters "Okay.
"
17 10 Butters "That's Lisa Berger?
"
17 10 Butters "She's pretty!
"
17 10 Butters "Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
"
17 10 Butters "And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her.

17 10 Butters "Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
17 10 Butters "II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
"
17 10 Butters "What?! Well since when?
"
17 10 Butters "No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim!

17 10 Butters "I do love water balloons.
