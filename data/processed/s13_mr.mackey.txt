13 4 "Mr. Mackey" "M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face.

13 12 "Mr. Mackey" "Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!

"
13 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Get lost, you little dirtball!
"
13 13 "Mr. Mackey" "I said take a hike!
"
13 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
"
13 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Well, because he was being murdered.
"
13 13 "Mr. Mackey" "Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
