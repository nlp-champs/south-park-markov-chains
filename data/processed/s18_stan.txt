"
18 9 Stan "I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18 9 Stan "I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18 9 Stan "What are you talking about?
"
18 9 Stan "Hey, what's up?
"
18 9 Stan "Oh no, what now?
"
18 9 Stan "Yeah?
"
18 9 Stan "Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
18 9 Stan "Grandpa?
"
18 9 Stan "Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
18 9 Stan "We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
"
18 9 Stan "Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
"
18 9 Stan "Tell me about it.
"
18 1 Stan "Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
"
18 1 Stan "Nah.
"
18 1 Stan "Uh huh.
"
18 1 Stan "Angry Clit Spasm
"
18 1 Stan "Whooping Fart Balls.
"
18 1 Stan "Lubricated Titty Burgers.
"
18 1 Stan "Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
"
18 1 Stan "Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
"
18 1 Stan "No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
"
18 1 Stan "No, we don't wanna do anything.
"
18 1 Stan "...Nnnno, there isn't. 
"
18 1 Stan "What?
"
18 1 Stan "I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
"
18 1 Stan "Washington Redskins.  I like it!
"
18 1 Stan "You alright dude?
"
18 1 Stan "What?! 
"
18 1 Stan "I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
"
18 1 Stan "Yeah...
"
18 1 Stan "I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.""
"
18 1 Stan "Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?
"
18 1 Stan "Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
"
18 1 Stan "I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
"
18 1 Stan "Good luck with your company, dude.
"
18 1 Stan "It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
"
18 1 Stan "And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
"
18 1 Stan "Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
"
18 1 Stan "But you all thought our name was sweet.
"
18 2 Stan "Morning!
"
18 2 Stan "Hey Wendy.
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
"
18 2 Stan "So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
"
18 2 Stan "Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
"
18 2 Stan "Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
"
18 2 Stan "For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
"
18 2 Stan "What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
"
18 2 Stan "Sweet!
"
18 2 Stan "Excuse me?
"
18 2 Stan "Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
"
18 2 Stan "We can't let our party suck.
"
18 2 Stan "I'll be back. 
"
18 2 Stan "Dad? Dad!
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
"
18 2 Stan "Nonono, not yet. DAD!
"
18 2 Stan "Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
"
18 2 Stan "Let me talk to my dad! 
"
18 2 Stan "There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
"
18 2 Stan "I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
"
18 2 Stan "Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
"
18 2 Stan "We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
"
18 2 Stan "Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
"
18 2 Stan "Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
"
18 2 Stan "What does that mean?
"
18 3 Stan "What is that?
"
18 3 Stan "Cartman's a girl now?
"
18 3 Stan "What?
"
18 3 Stan "Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
"
18 3 Stan "Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
"
18 3 Stan "...What?
"
18 3 Stan "Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
"
18 3 Stan "The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
"
18 3 Stan "Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
"
18 3 Stan "Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
"
18 3 Stan "...I don't know where I belong...
"
18 3 Stan "I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
"
18 3 Stan "To the bathroom?
"
18 3 Stan "Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
"
18 5 Stan "Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
"
18 5 Stan "I know. 
"
18 5 Stan "Sup? 
"
18 5 Stan "What?
"
18 5 Stan "Let me see.
"
18 5 Stan "How'd you get that on your phone?
"
18 6 Stan "I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
"
18 6 Stan "You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"
18 6 Stan "I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
"
18 6 Stan "I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
"
18 6 Stan "Ohhh hey guys.
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
"
18 6 Stan "Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
"
18 6 Stan "Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
"
18 6 Stan "You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
"
18 6 Stan "It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
"
18 6 Stan "It's just...
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah, it's fun.
"
18 6 Stan "Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
"
18 6 Stan "...Free? 
"
18 6 Stan "I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
"
18 6 Stan "One?
"
18 6 Stan "No, no, it's not.
"
18 6 Stan "I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
"
18 6 Stan "Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
"
18 6 Stan "It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
"
18 6 Stan "How?
"
18 6 Stan "I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
"
18 6 Stan "Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
"
18 6 Stan "Okay.
"
18 6 Stan "So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
"
18 6 Stan "So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
"
18 6 Stan "The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah, no, this is great.
"
18 6 Stan "I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
"
18 6 Stan "That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
"
18 6 Stan "Ah, Canada?
"
18 6 Stan "...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!
"
18 6 Stan "I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
18 6 Stan "Hey.
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
18 6 Stan "I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
"
18 6 Stan "We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
18 6 Stan "That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
"
18 6 Stan "Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
"
18 7 Stan "Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
18 7 Stan "Sound pretty typical to me.
"
18 7 Stan "Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"
18 7 Stan "Kyle, maybe this is for real.
"
18 7 Stan "In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!
"
18 7 Stan """Fuck you"" what?
"
18 7 Stan "Oh fuck you!
"
18 7 Stan "No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
18 7 Stan "It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
"
18 7 Stan "No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
"
18 7 Stan "How do you know?
"
18 7 Stan "What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
"
18 7 Stan "Butters called Customer Service first?
"
18 7 Stan "Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 
"
18 7 Stan "Butters.
"
18 7 Stan "So now we are in th real world.
"
18 7 Stan "Yes, we're here.
"
18 7 Stan "Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
"
18 7 Stan "What?! 
"
18 7 Stan "That doesn't make sense! 
"
18 7 Stan "Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
"
18 7 Stan "Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
"
18 7 Stan "Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"
18 7 Stan "Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
"
18 7 Stan "It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
"
18 8 Stan "Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
18 8 Stan "Shhh!
"
18 8 Stan "What's that?
"
18 8 Stan "This late?
"
18 8 Stan "It was seriously almost hard to watch. 
"
18 8 Stan "Wendy, did you hear about last night?
"
18 8 Stan "Not that. Did you actually go to that?
"
18 8 Stan "Pfft whatever.
"
18 8 Stan "We're men.
"
18 8 Stan "Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
"
18 8 Stan "That was freakin' hardcore.
"
18 8 Stan "It was just decimation.
"
18 8 Stan "Hell yeah! 
"
18 8 Stan "What's mean about it?
"
18 8 Stan "Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
"
18 8 Stan "Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
18 8 Stan "Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
"
18 8 Stan "Do you think they're happy?
"
18 8 Stan "Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18 8 Stan "Hey, how about this little guy?
"
18 8 Stan "Yeah!
"
18 8 Stan "Gee, thanks!
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
"
18 8 Stan "What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
"
18 8 Stan "Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
"
18 8 Stan "What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
"
18 8 Stan "Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
"
18 8 Stan "Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
"
18 8 Stan "A way to finally do something good for other people.
"
18 10 Stan "Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
"
18 10 Stan "Who did?
"
18 10 Stan "That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
18 10 Stan "That self-promoting asshole!
"
18 10 Stan "Because my dad's an idiot!
"
18 10 Stan "Nnnothing, nothing.
"
18 10 Stan "We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah, you damn kids!
"
18 10 Stan "Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
"
18 10 Stan "Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
"
18 10 Stan "He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
"
18 10 Stan "It just all seemed so... stupid.
"
18 10 Stan "Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"
18 10 Stan "What?? 
"
18 10 Stan "Dude. You're such a grandpa.
"
18 10 Stan "I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah, I think that's great too.
"
18 9 Stan "I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18 9 Stan "I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18 9 Stan "I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18 9 Stan "What are you talking about?
"
18 9 Stan "Hey, what's up?
"
18 9 Stan "Oh no, what now?
"
18 9 Stan "Yeah?
"
18 9 Stan "Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
18 9 Stan "Grandpa?
"
18 9 Stan "Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
18 9 Stan "We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!

18 6 Stan "I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
"
18 6 Stan "Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
"
18 6 Stan "Okay.
"
18 6 Stan "So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
"
18 6 Stan "So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
"
18 6 Stan "The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah, no, this is great.
"
18 6 Stan "I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
"
18 6 Stan "That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
"
18 6 Stan "Ah, Canada?
"
18 6 Stan "...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!
"
18 6 Stan "I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
18 6 Stan "Hey.
"
18 6 Stan "Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
18 6 Stan "I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
"
18 6 Stan "We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
18 6 Stan "That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
"
18 6 Stan "Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
"
18 7 Stan "Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
18 7 Stan "Sound pretty typical to me.
"
18 7 Stan "Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"
18 7 Stan "Kyle, maybe this is for real.
"
18 7 Stan "In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!
"
18 7 Stan """Fuck you"" what?
"
18 7 Stan "Oh fuck you!
"
18 7 Stan "No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
18 7 Stan "It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
"
18 7 Stan "No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
"
18 7 Stan "How do you know?
"
18 7 Stan "What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
"
18 7 Stan "Butters called Customer Service first?
"
18 7 Stan "Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 
"
18 7 Stan "Butters.
"
18 7 Stan "So now we are in th real world.
"
18 7 Stan "Yes, we're here.
"
18 7 Stan "Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
"
18 7 Stan "What?! 
"
18 7 Stan "That doesn't make sense! 
"
18 7 Stan "Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
"
18 7 Stan "Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
"
18 7 Stan "Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"
18 7 Stan "Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
"
18 7 Stan "It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
"
18 8 Stan "Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
18 8 Stan "Shhh!
"
18 8 Stan "What's that?
"
18 8 Stan "This late?
"
18 8 Stan "It was seriously almost hard to watch. 
"
18 8 Stan "Wendy, did you hear about last night?
"
18 8 Stan "Not that. Did you actually go to that?
"
18 8 Stan "Pfft whatever.
"
18 8 Stan "We're men.
"
18 8 Stan "Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
"
18 8 Stan "That was freakin' hardcore.
"
18 8 Stan "It was just decimation.
"
18 8 Stan "Hell yeah! 
"
18 8 Stan "What's mean about it?
"
18 8 Stan "Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
"
18 8 Stan "Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
18 8 Stan "Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
"
18 8 Stan "Do you think they're happy?
"
18 8 Stan "Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18 8 Stan "Hey, how about this little guy?
"
18 8 Stan "Yeah!
"
18 8 Stan "Gee, thanks!
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
"
18 8 Stan "Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
"
18 8 Stan "What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
"
18 8 Stan "Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
"
18 8 Stan "What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
"
18 8 Stan "Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
"
18 8 Stan "Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
"
18 8 Stan "A way to finally do something good for other people.
"
18 10 Stan "Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
"
18 10 Stan "Who did?
"
18 10 Stan "That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
18 10 Stan "That self-promoting asshole!
"
18 10 Stan "Because my dad's an idiot!
"
18 10 Stan "Nnnothing, nothing.
"
18 10 Stan "We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah, you damn kids!
"
18 10 Stan "Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
"
18 10 Stan "Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
"
18 10 Stan "He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
"
18 10 Stan "It just all seemed so... stupid.
"
18 10 Stan "Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"
18 10 Stan "What?? 
"
18 10 Stan "Dude. You're such a grandpa.
"
18 10 Stan "I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
18 10 Stan "Yeah, I think that's great too.
"
