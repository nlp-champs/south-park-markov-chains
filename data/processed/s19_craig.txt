19 2 Craig "Yeah, kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another.
"
19 6 Craig "Dude, what the fuck?
"
19 6 Craig "Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? 
"
19 6 Craig "What? Well what did she say?
"
19 6 Craig "Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
"
19 6 Craig "But we aren't! I'm not!
"
19 6 Craig "But I'm not gay!
"
19 6 Craig "No you may not!
"
19 6 Craig "Got a fuckin' problem man?! 
"
19 6 Craig "I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
"
19 6 Craig "Goddammit!
"
19 6 Craig "Is Tweek home?
"
19 6 Craig "No thank you, I just want to see Tweek.
"
19 6 Craig "Hey dude. 
"
19 6 Craig "Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this.
"
19 6 Craig "Me too, dude. But there's something we can do.
"
19 6 Craig "We have to come out and say we're gay.
"
19 6 Craig "Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures. We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls.
"
19 6 Craig "You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think.
"
19 6 Craig "You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?
"
19 6 Craig "Hey Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. 
"
19 6 Craig "I'm sorry Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore.  Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together.
"
19 6 Craig "It's just that people are different. That's all.
"
19 6 Craig "What? What are you, what are you talking about?
"
19 6 Craig "Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened.
"
19 6 Craig "No.  Uh look, we both know this is for the better.
"
19 6 Craig "Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
"
19 6 Craig "You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary.
"
19 6 Craig "This wasn't part of the plan!
"
19 6 Craig "Dude, seriously? Seriously?
"
19 6 Craig "What do you want?
"
19 6 Craig "Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!
"
19 6 Craig "You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?
"
19 6 Craig "Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
"
19 6 Craig "I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
