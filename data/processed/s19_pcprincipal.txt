19 1 "PC Principal" "All right, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word ""retarded""! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "A chef ""person of color"" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom!  A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Woowoowoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow  anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You'll have toe excuse my language.  ""I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.""  This kind of transphobic and  bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing,  beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Get the fuck out of here, dude! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Hey! What seems to be the problem here, gentlemen?!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "I'm PC Principal.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "No way! There's more PC bros here?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Sweet, bro. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What the fuck are you talking about?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What did you just say?
"
19 1 "PC Principal" """Capisce""?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?!  You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Did you just say ""spokesman"" instead of ""spokesperson""?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?!  Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You dare use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with biases like yours on a daily basis?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "All right pledges, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You know, there's still some people out there that say ""What does being PC really mean?"" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making it to the final cuts. 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do to prove you belong with PC, is just go out there, and check someone's privilege.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Topher, can you explain ""check your privilege"" please.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Yeah, see, there's some people out there like Brett fucking Favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPY Awards, he can get away with one of these bullshit claps!  It's called ""clapping"" Favre! What the fuck are you doing?! Washing your hands?! You're either on board, or you're NOT, bro! Now, if he's gonna bring shame on someone, then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "No. 'Cause there's somebody even worse now.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You're not only PC, you've actually changed my PC.  Congrats. Here's your Oakleys.
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a ""Canuck""?!
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione?  Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs.
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and  HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH!  - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "Garrison, what do you think you're-?
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal.
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "That's right.
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey! You got a fuckin' problem Mackey!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school!  Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there.  You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put what Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more os a safe space for him.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "That's right.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "You sure about that?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4!  And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations!  So, any comment that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Do you want detention?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a-  HEY LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT!  We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty.  So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I thank can help.  So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Your safe space.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe space. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up.  Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE!  -from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "If there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to tough Craig's penis, you just can't go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like ""Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?"" Okay? Let's try it out.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say ""You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that.""  Or of course, you could say ""No, you may not touch my penis at this time.""
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what should you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You  see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries.  That one. Right there. You remove her from my school.
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "Get her out of here! 
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "Waaaah!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked!  When I find out who did this!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this!  Broflovski! Was it you?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word ""retarded"" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word ""retarded"" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper.  You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts.  Can you understand that at all?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What'd you say?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Okay, well, no, you are confused-
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word ""retarded""?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... 
And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up.  Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities.  I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! 
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "McKinsey, you got consent forms?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Nice.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What, bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Naturally.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What the fuck is this bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "That's not true!!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "That little fucker, dude!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space.  No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out.  All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Nooo!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called...  Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat.  Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Dude!  What the fuck, bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What the hell is going on, bro?!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father?  I didn't think you were human. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Huh, ain't that a peach?
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "HEY LESLIE!  Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes.  THAT PISSES ME OFF!  You're expelled. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species.  We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die.  They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair.  But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months.  The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "All right, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word ""retarded""! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "A chef ""person of color"" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom!  A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Woowoowoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow  anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You'll have toe excuse my language.  ""I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.""  This kind of transphobic and  bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing,  beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
"

"
19 1 "PC Principal" """Capisce""?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?!  You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Did you just say ""spokesman"" instead of ""spokesperson""?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?!  Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! 
"
19 1 "PC Principal" "You dare use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with biases like yours on a daily basis?!

SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH!  - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "Garrison, what do you think you're-?
"
19 2 "PC Principal" "That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal.
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "That's right.
"
19 3 "PC Principal" "You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey! You got a fuckin' problem Mackey!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school!  Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there.  You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put what Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more os a safe space for him.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "That's right.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "You sure about that?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4!  And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations!  So, any comment that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Do you want detention?
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a-  HEY LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT!  We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty.  So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I thank can help.  So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Your safe space.
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe space. 
"
19 5 "PC Principal" "I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up.  Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE!  -from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "If there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to tough Craig's penis, you just can't go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like ""Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?"" Okay? Let's try it out.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say ""You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that.""  Or of course, you could say ""No, you may not touch my penis at this time.""
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what should you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
"
19 6 "PC Principal" "There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You  see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries.  That one. Right there. You remove her from my school.
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "Get her out of here! 
"
19 7 "PC Principal" "Waaaah!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked!  When I find out who did this!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this!  Broflovski! Was it you?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word ""retarded"" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word ""retarded"" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper.  You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts.  Can you understand that at all?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What'd you say?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Okay, well, no, you are confused-
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word ""retarded""?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... 
And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up.  Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities.  I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! 
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "McKinsey, you got consent forms?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Nice.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What, bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Naturally.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What the fuck is this bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "That's not true!!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "That little fucker, dude!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space.  No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out.  All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Nooo!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called...  Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat.  Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Yeah?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Dude!  What the fuck, bro?
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "What the hell is going on, bro?!
"
19 8 "PC Principal" "Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father?  I didn't think you were human. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet.
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Huh, ain't that a peach?
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "HEY LESLIE!  Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes.  THAT PISSES ME OFF!  You're expelled. 
"
19 10 "PC Principal" "Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species.  We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die.  They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair.  But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months.  The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
