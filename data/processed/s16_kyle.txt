16 1 Kyle "Is your mom always like that dude?
"
16 1 Kyle "Cartman, it was actually really lame.
"
16 1 Kyle "I know, fatass. I was there.
"
16 1 Kyle "That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
16 1 Kyle "Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
"
16 1 Kyle "Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
"
16 1 Kyle "What's going on?
"
16 1 Kyle "From what?
"
16 1 Kyle "Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
"
16 1 Kyle "So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"
16 1 Kyle "All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
16 1 Kyle "Aw, he's dead?
"
16 1 Kyle "You hear that Clyde?
"
16 1 Kyle "Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
"
16 1 Kyle "What?
"
16 2 Kyle "That... was six grand?
"
16 2 Kyle "Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.
"
16 2 Kyle "Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
"
16 2 Kyle "Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
"
16 2 Kyle "You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"
16 2 Kyle "Dude, that's terrible!
"
16 2 Kyle "That's the chemical equation for gold?
"
16 2 Kyle "...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
16 2 Kyle "Yeah!
"
16 2 Kyle "What does that mean?
"
16 2 Kyle "Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""
"
16 2 Kyle "We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
"
16 2 Kyle "What's he doing?
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
16 3 Kyle "Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "Go Cartman! 
"
16 3 Kyle "So, what do you want to do now?
"
16 3 Kyle "You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
"
16 3 Kyle "How can that be? Already?
"
16 3 Kyle "How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
16 3 Kyle "But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yep, that's great. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
16 3 Kyle "W-what's the matter, Kenny?
"
16 3 Kyle "Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
16 3 Kyle "We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
16 3 Kyle "Benedict Arnold. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Kenny?
"
16 3 Kyle "You guys are sellouts.
"
16 3 Kyle "You're freaking sellouts!
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, good idea. 
"
16 3 Kyle "We have to face it, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "I really thought it was gonna last.
"
16 3 Kyle "It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
"
16 3 Kyle "I-It's good that it became something else.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, that's awesome.
"
16 3 Kyle "What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
"
16 3 Kyle "It's super awesome.
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
"
16 3 Kyle "Two, one. Go Cartman!
"
16 3 Kyle "Cartman? Go, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
"
16 4 Kyle "Get out of here.
"
16 4 Kyle "Get. Outta here! 
"
16 4 Kyle "What are you gonna do?
"
16 4 Kyle "No?
"
16 4 Kyle "What does that have to do with Passover?
"
16 4 Kyle "Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
"
16 4 Kyle "I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"
16 4 Kyle "If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
"
16 4 Kyle "Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"
16 4 Kyle "These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
"
16 4 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
16 4 Kyle "Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
"
16 4 Kyle "Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
16 4 Kyle "That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
"
16 4 Kyle "It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
"
16 4 Kyle "It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
"
16 4 Kyle "That's just how God is.
"
16 4 Kyle "This is what God told us to do!
"
16 4 Kyle "You'll see! 
"
16 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
16 4 Kyle "I know, you're not.
"
16 4 Kyle "Happy Passover, Cartman. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Where's your lunch, Butters?
"
16 5 Kyle "Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
"
16 5 Kyle "Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
"
16 5 Kyle "Pansy.
"
16 5 Kyle "He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
"
16 5 Kyle "Why are you doing this, Stan?
"
16 5 Kyle "You're gonna stop bullying.
"
16 5 Kyle "With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"
16 5 Kyle "Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"
16 5 Kyle "Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
"
16 5 Kyle "I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
"
16 5 Kyle "Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
"
16 5 Kyle "What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
16 5 Kyle "Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
"
16 5 Kyle "If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
"
16 5 Kyle "If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
16 5 Kyle "Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
"
16 6 Kyle "We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
"
16 6 Kyle "We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"
16 6 Kyle "And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
"
16 6 Kyle "We've definitely not done that before!
"
16 6 Kyle "Cool! Ziplining.
"
16 6 Kyle "And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
16 6 Kyle "So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
"
16 6 Kyle "We don't mind.
"
16 6 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
16 6 Kyle "How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
"
16 6 Kyle "Dude, did you fart?!
"
16 6 Kyle "Well? How was it, Cartman?
"
16 6 Kyle "Zipline. 
"
16 6 Kyle "It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"
16 6 Kyle "E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
"
16 6 Kyle "STOP!
"
16 6 Kyle "Wugh!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
16 6 Kyle "It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
"
16 6 Kyle "Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
"
16 6 Kyle "Me?!
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
"
16 6 Kyle "You fat piece of shit!
"
16 6 Kyle "DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"
16 6 Kyle "The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
16 6 Kyle "You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"
16 6 Kyle "Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh, thank God!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAH! 
"
16 6 Kyle "Can we please go faster?!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16 6 Kyle "Just go. Go without me.
"
16 6 Kyle "I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.
"
16 6 Kyle "What's the point?
"
16 6 Kyle "Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"
16 6 Kyle "Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
"
16 6 Kyle "Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"
16 6 Kyle "I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
16 6 Kyle "IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
"
16 6 Kyle "So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
"
16 6 Kyle "You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"
16 6 Kyle "You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
"
16 6 Kyle "How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
"
16 6 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!
"
16 7 Kyle "Just tell us, Butters.
"
16 7 Kyle "Will you shut the hell up?! 
"
16 7 Kyle "Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
16 7 Kyle "Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
"
16 7 Kyle "Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
16 7 Kyle "Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
"
16 7 Kyle "Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
"
16 7 Kyle "It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
"
16 7 Kyle "You motherfucker! 
"
16 7 Kyle "What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"
16 7 Kyle "The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
"
16 7 Kyle "Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
"
16 7 Kyle "What?!
"
16 7 Kyle "Who is Cupid Me?!
"
16 7 Kyle "You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
"
16 7 Kyle "God-damnit! 
"
16 7 Kyle "Hey man. You okay?
"
16 7 Kyle "What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
16 7 Kyle "So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
"
16 7 Kyle "So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
"
16 7 Kyle "Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
16 7 Kyle "Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
"
16 7 Kyle "That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
"
16 8 Kyle "We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
"
16 8 Kyle "This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
"
16 8 Kyle "We don't even understand how this game is played.
"
16 8 Kyle "Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?
"
16 8 Kyle "But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
"
16 8 Kyle "We can't.
"
16 8 Kyle "We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
16 9 Kyle "Right, you're not fat.
"
16 9 Kyle "Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
"
16 9 Kyle "Why do they even allow those things in stored?
"
16 9 Kyle "You've gotta be kidding me!
"
16 9 Kyle "Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Why? 
"
16 9 Kyle "Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
"
16 9 Kyle "Oh no!
"
16 9 Kyle "You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
16 9 Kyle "That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
"
16 9 Kyle "What??
"
16 9 Kyle "So take a shit somewhere else!
"
16 9 Kyle "You have got to be kidding me!
"
16 9 Kyle "We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
16 9 Kyle "So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
16 9 Kyle "Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
16 9 Kyle "Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
16 9 Kyle "Come on, hurry it up in there! 
"
16 9 Kyle "This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
16 9 Kyle "Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
16 9 Kyle "Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
16 9 Kyle "You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
"
16 9 Kyle "Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
"
16 9 Kyle "Fatty Doo Doo?
"
16 9 Kyle "What?
"
16 9 Kyle "What have you done?
"
16 9 Kyle "When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16 9 Kyle "You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
16 9 Kyle "When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
16 9 Kyle "I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
16 9 Kyle "Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
16 9 Kyle "What?
"
16 9 Kyle "What? Oh my God.
"
16 9 Kyle "I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
"
16 9 Kyle "You found a network to buy it?
"
16 9 Kyle "I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
"
16 9 Kyle "Huh?
"
16 9 Kyle "I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
"
16 10 Kyle "Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
"
16 10 Kyle "I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
"
16 10 Kyle "Oh no...
"
16 10 Kyle "You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
"
16 10 Kyle "Take a look. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah dude. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
"
16 10 Kyle "I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
"
16 10 Kyle "What?
"
16 10 Kyle "It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
16 10 Kyle "I know...
"
16 10 Kyle "What?!
"
16 10 Kyle "Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
16 10 Kyle "The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
"
16 10 Kyle "Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
"
16 10 Kyle "And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
"
16 10 Kyle "Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
"
16 10 Kyle "You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
16 10 Kyle "Dude, come down here!
"
16 10 Kyle "Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
"
16 11 Kyle "Butters?  Why?
"
16 11 Kyle "Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
"
16 11 Kyle "What?
"
16 11 Kyle "Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
"
16 11 Kyle "Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
16 12 Kyle "But what about the costume contest?!
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan can't come.
"
16 12 Kyle "Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
"
16 12 Kyle "Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
"
16 12 Kyle "All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
"
16 12 Kyle "He looks fine.
"
16 12 Kyle "We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
16 12 Kyle "Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
"
16 12 Kyle "Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
"
16 12 Kyle "Oh, sorry dude.
"
16 12 Kyle "For Odin! For Asgard!
"
16 12 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
16 12 Kyle "And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan! 
"
16 12 Kyle "What happened to you?
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan?
"
16 12 Kyle "The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"
16 12 Kyle "You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
"
16 13 Kyle "Did you do it?
"
16 13 Kyle "What are you people talking about?
"
16 13 Kyle "Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
"
16 13 Kyle "You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
"
16 13 Kyle "Because you kind of made it matter.
"
16 13 Kyle "S-so you did superglue it.
"
16 13 Kyle "Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
"
16 13 Kyle "Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"
16 14 Kyle "Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
"
16 14 Kyle "Nothing, watching the election results.
"
16 14 Kyle "What?!
"
16 14 Kyle "Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
"
16 14 Kyle "It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
"
16 14 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
16 14 Kyle "Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
"
16 14 Kyle "What the hell is this?
"
16 14 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
16 14 Kyle "Why do you have these?
"
16 14 Kyle "Dude!
"
16 14 Kyle "Knock it off, Cartman!
"
16 14 Kyle "You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
"
16 14 Kyle "This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
"
16 14 Kyle "Upstairs! First door to the left!
"
16 14 Kyle "But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
16 14 Kyle "Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
"
16 14 Kyle "Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
"
16 14 Kyle "Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
"
16 14 Kyle "Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
"
16 14 Kyle "God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
"
16 14 Kyle "Butters, you know something, don't you?!
"
16 14 Kyle "What did Cartman tell you?!
"
16 14 Kyle "Tell us what you know right now!
"
16 14 Kyle "Then you have to tell us!
"
16 14 Kyle "Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 
"
16 14 Kyle "Can we please just try and talk to him?
"
16 14 Kyle "Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
"
16 14 Kyle "I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
"
16 14 Kyle "Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
"
16 14 Kyle "What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
"
16 14 Kyle "Where?
"
16 14 Kyle "What?
"
16 14 Kyle "All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
"
16 14 Kyle "Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
"
16 14 Kyle "Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
"
16 14 Kyle "Well keep looking.
"
16 14 Kyle "Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
"
16 14 Kyle "We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
"
16 14 Kyle "Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 
"
16 14 Kyle "What?
"
16 14 Kyle "I... what? 
"
16 14 Kyle "It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
"
16 14 Kyle "It matters, Stan. It it matters.
"
16 14 Kyle "Oh my God.
"
16 14 Kyle "Look! There they are!
"
16 14 Kyle "We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
"
16 14 Kyle "No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
"
16 14 Kyle "Protect it?
"
16 14 Kyle "Well... if you put it that way...
"
16 1 Kyle "Is your mom always like that dude?
"
16 1 Kyle "Cartman, it was actually really lame.
"
16 1 Kyle "I know, fatass. I was there.
"
16 1 Kyle "That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
16 1 Kyle "Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
"
16 1 Kyle "Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
"
16 1 Kyle "What's going on?
"
16 1 Kyle "From what?
"
16 1 Kyle "Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
"
16 1 Kyle "So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"
16 1 Kyle "All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
16 1 Kyle "Aw, he's dead?
"
16 1 Kyle "You hear that Clyde?
"
16 1 Kyle "Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
"
16 1 Kyle "What?
"
16 2 Kyle "That... was six grand?
"
16 2 Kyle "Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.
"
16 2 Kyle "Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
"
16 2 Kyle "Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
"
16 2 Kyle "You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"
16 2 Kyle "Dude, that's terrible!
"
16 2 Kyle "That's the chemical equation for gold?
"
16 2 Kyle "...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
16 2 Kyle "Yeah!
"
16 2 Kyle "What does that mean?
"
16 2 Kyle "Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""
"
16 2 Kyle "We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
"
16 2 Kyle "What's he doing?
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
16 3 Kyle "Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "Go Cartman! 
"
16 3 Kyle "So, what do you want to do now?
"
16 3 Kyle "You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
"
16 3 Kyle "How can that be? Already?
"
16 3 Kyle "How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
16 3 Kyle "But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yep, that's great. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
16 3 Kyle "W-what's the matter, Kenny?
"
16 3 Kyle "Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
16 3 Kyle "We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
16 3 Kyle "Benedict Arnold. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Kenny?
"
16 3 Kyle "You guys are sellouts.
"
16 3 Kyle "You're freaking sellouts!
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, good idea. 
"
16 3 Kyle "We have to face it, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "I really thought it was gonna last.
"
16 3 Kyle "It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
"
16 3 Kyle "I-It's good that it became something else.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah, that's awesome.
"
16 3 Kyle "What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
"
16 3 Kyle "It's super awesome.
"
16 3 Kyle "Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
"
16 3 Kyle "Two, one. Go Cartman!
"
16 3 Kyle "Cartman? Go, Cartman.
"
16 3 Kyle "Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
"
16 4 Kyle "Get out of here.
"
16 4 Kyle "Get. Outta here! 
"
16 4 Kyle "What are you gonna do?
"
16 4 Kyle "No?
"
16 4 Kyle "What does that have to do with Passover?
"
16 4 Kyle "Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
"
16 4 Kyle "I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"
16 4 Kyle "If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
"
16 4 Kyle "Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"
16 4 Kyle "These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
"
16 4 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
16 4 Kyle "Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
"
16 4 Kyle "Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
16 4 Kyle "That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
"
16 4 Kyle "It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
"
16 4 Kyle "It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
"
16 4 Kyle "That's just how God is.
"
16 4 Kyle "This is what God told us to do!
"
16 4 Kyle "You'll see! 
"
16 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
16 4 Kyle "I know, you're not.
"
16 4 Kyle "Happy Passover, Cartman. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Where's your lunch, Butters?
"
16 5 Kyle "Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
"
16 5 Kyle "Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
"
16 5 Kyle "Pansy.
"
16 5 Kyle "He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
"
16 5 Kyle "Why are you doing this, Stan?
"
16 5 Kyle "You're gonna stop bullying.
"
16 5 Kyle "With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"
16 5 Kyle "Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"
16 5 Kyle "Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
"
16 5 Kyle "I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
"
16 5 Kyle "Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
"
16 5 Kyle "Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
"
16 5 Kyle "What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
16 5 Kyle "Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
"
16 5 Kyle "If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
"
16 5 Kyle "If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
16 5 Kyle "Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
"
16 6 Kyle "We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
"
16 6 Kyle "We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"
16 6 Kyle "And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
"
16 6 Kyle "We've definitely not done that before!
"
16 6 Kyle "Cool! Ziplining.
"
16 6 Kyle "And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
16 6 Kyle "So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
"
16 6 Kyle "We don't mind.
"
16 6 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
16 6 Kyle "How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
"
16 6 Kyle "Dude, did you fart?!
"
16 6 Kyle "Well? How was it, Cartman?
"
16 6 Kyle "Zipline. 
"
16 6 Kyle "It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"
16 6 Kyle "E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
"
16 6 Kyle "STOP!
"
16 6 Kyle "Wugh!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
16 6 Kyle "It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
"
16 6 Kyle "Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
"
16 6 Kyle "Me?!
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
"
16 6 Kyle "You fat piece of shit!
"
16 6 Kyle "DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"
16 6 Kyle "The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
16 6 Kyle "You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"
16 6 Kyle "Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh, thank God!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAH! 
"
16 6 Kyle "Can we please go faster?!
"
16 6 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16 6 Kyle "Just go. Go without me.
"
16 6 Kyle "I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.
"
16 6 Kyle "What's the point?
"
16 6 Kyle "Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"
16 6 Kyle "Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
"
16 6 Kyle "Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"
16 6 Kyle "I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
16 6 Kyle "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
16 6 Kyle "IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
"
16 6 Kyle "So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
"
16 6 Kyle "You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"
16 6 Kyle "You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
"
16 6 Kyle "How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
"
16 6 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!
"
16 7 Kyle "Just tell us, Butters.
"
16 7 Kyle "Will you shut the hell up?! 
"
16 7 Kyle "Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
16 7 Kyle "Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
"
16 7 Kyle "Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
16 7 Kyle "Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
"
16 7 Kyle "Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
"
16 7 Kyle "It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
"
16 7 Kyle "You motherfucker! 
"
16 7 Kyle "What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"
16 7 Kyle "The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
"
16 7 Kyle "Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
"
16 7 Kyle "What?!
"
16 7 Kyle "Who is Cupid Me?!
"
16 7 Kyle "You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
"
16 7 Kyle "God-damnit! 
"
16 7 Kyle "Hey man. You okay?
"
16 7 Kyle "What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
16 7 Kyle "So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
"
16 7 Kyle "So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
"
16 7 Kyle "Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
16 7 Kyle "Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
"
16 7 Kyle "That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
"
16 8 Kyle "We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
"
16 8 Kyle "This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
"
16 8 Kyle "We don't even understand how this game is played.
"
16 8 Kyle "Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?
"
16 8 Kyle "But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
"
16 8 Kyle "We can't.
"
16 8 Kyle "We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
16 9 Kyle "Right, you're not fat.
"
16 9 Kyle "Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
"
16 9 Kyle "Why do they even allow those things in stored?
"
16 9 Kyle "You've gotta be kidding me!
"
16 9 Kyle "Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Why? 
"
16 9 Kyle "Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
"
16 9 Kyle "Oh no!
"
16 9 Kyle "You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
16 9 Kyle "That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
"
16 9 Kyle "What??
"
16 9 Kyle "So take a shit somewhere else!
"
16 9 Kyle "You have got to be kidding me!
"
16 9 Kyle "We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
16 9 Kyle "So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
16 9 Kyle "Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
16 9 Kyle "Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
16 9 Kyle "Come on, hurry it up in there! 
"
16 9 Kyle "This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
16 9 Kyle "Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
16 9 Kyle "Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
16 9 Kyle "You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
"
16 9 Kyle "Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
16 9 Kyle "Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
"
16 9 Kyle "Fatty Doo Doo?
"
16 9 Kyle "What?
"
16 9 Kyle "What have you done?
"
16 9 Kyle "When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16 9 Kyle "You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
16 9 Kyle "When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
16 9 Kyle "I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
16 9 Kyle "Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
16 9 Kyle "What?
"
16 9 Kyle "What? Oh my God.
"
16 9 Kyle "I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
"
16 9 Kyle "You found a network to buy it?
"
16 9 Kyle "I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
"
16 9 Kyle "Huh?
"
16 9 Kyle "I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
"
16 10 Kyle "Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
"
16 10 Kyle "I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
"
16 10 Kyle "Oh no...
"
16 10 Kyle "You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
"
16 10 Kyle "Take a look. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah dude. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
"
16 10 Kyle "I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
"
16 10 Kyle "What?
"
16 10 Kyle "It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
16 10 Kyle "I know...
"
16 10 Kyle "What?!
"
16 10 Kyle "Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
16 10 Kyle "The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
"
16 10 Kyle "Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
"
16 10 Kyle "And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
16 10 Kyle "Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
"
16 10 Kyle "Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
"
16 10 Kyle "You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
16 10 Kyle "Dude, come down here!
"
16 10 Kyle "Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
"
16 11 Kyle "Butters?  Why?
"
16 11 Kyle "Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
"
16 11 Kyle "What?
"
16 11 Kyle "Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
"
16 11 Kyle "Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
16 12 Kyle "But what about the costume contest?!
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan can't come.
"
16 12 Kyle "Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
"
16 12 Kyle "Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
"
16 12 Kyle "All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
"
16 12 Kyle "He looks fine.
"
16 12 Kyle "We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
16 12 Kyle "Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
"
16 12 Kyle "Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
"
16 12 Kyle "Oh, sorry dude.
"
16 12 Kyle "For Odin! For Asgard!
"
16 12 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
16 12 Kyle "And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan! 
"
16 12 Kyle "What happened to you?
"
16 12 Kyle "Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
"
16 12 Kyle "Stan?
"
16 12 Kyle "The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"
16 12 Kyle "You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
"
16 13 Kyle "Did you do it?
"
16 13 Kyle "What are you people talking about?
"
16 13 Kyle "Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
"
16 13 Kyle "You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
"
16 13 Kyle "Because you kind of made it matter.
"
16 13 Kyle "S-so you did superglue it.
"
16 13 Kyle "Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
"
16 13 Kyle "Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"
16 14 Kyle "Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
"
16 14 Kyle "Nothing, watching the election results.
"
16 14 Kyle "What?!
"
16 14 Kyle "Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
"
16 14 Kyle "It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
"
16 14 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
16 14 Kyle "Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
"
16 14 Kyle "What the hell is this?
"
16 14 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
16 14 Kyle "Why do you have these?
"
16 14 Kyle "Dude!
"
16 14 Kyle "Knock it off, Cartman!
"
16 14 Kyle "You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
"
16 14 Kyle "This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
"
16 14 Kyle "Upstairs! First door to the left!
"
16 14 Kyle "But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
