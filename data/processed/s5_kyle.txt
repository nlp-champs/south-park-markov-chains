5 1 Kyle "Hey you guys! Look what I have!
"
5 1 Kyle "Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
"
5 1 Kyle "Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
"
5 1 Kyle "What, doughboy?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?!
"
5 1 Kyle "Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
5 1 Kyle "They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?
"
5 1 Kyle "Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
"
5 1 Kyle "It's stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
"
5 1 Kyle "Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
5 1 Kyle "How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
"
5 1 Kyle "I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "I don't really give a fuck! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"
5 1 Kyle "Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
"
5 1 Kyle "Oh, whatever. 
"
5 1 Kyle "This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
"
5 1 Kyle "There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
"
5 1 Kyle "Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.
"
5 1 Kyle "I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?
"
5 1 Kyle "No no! The word, ""shit"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.
"
5 1 Kyle "A... curse word.
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, this is serious!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
"
5 1 Kyle "...No.
"
5 1 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 1 Kyle "We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
5 1 Kyle "And asshole.
"
5 1 Kyle "Wait! 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
"
5 1 Kyle "You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
"
5 1 Kyle "We're all saying the S-word too much! 
"
5 1 Kyle "The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's pretty cool, dude!
"
5 3 Kyle "He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
"
5 3 Kyle "Wow, that's cool!
"
5 3 Kyle "Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
"
5 3 Kyle """David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not really happy.
"
5 3 Kyle "My potential hasn't even been reached.
"
5 3 Kyle "Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"
5 3 Kyle "We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
"
5 3 Kyle "So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm Kyle.
"
5 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
"
5 3 Kyle "But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
"
5 3 Kyle "What are we doing?
"
5 3 Kyle "Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
"
5 3 Kyle "It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
"
5 3 Kyle "Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not going anywhere!
"
5 3 Kyle "Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan.
"
5 3 Kyle "Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's right.
"
5 3 Kyle "...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
"
5 3 Kyle "David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
"
5 3 Kyle "How many tickets can we put you down for?
"
5 3 Kyle "Great!
"
5 3 Kyle "That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
5 3 Kyle "This is a really good turnout.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude, no way! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
5 3 Kyle "Yeah. Why is that good news?
"
5 3 Kyle "Mass suicide?
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
5 3 Kyle "It's just me.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
"
5 3 Kyle "Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
"
5 3 Kyle "What have you done, Cartman?!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, no!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Stan!
"
5 3 Kyle "I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Wagh. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"
5 3 Kyle "Haha, hehahaha.
"
5 4 Kyle "What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
5 4 Kyle "...What the hell are you talking about?!
"
5 4 Kyle "What's ""pubes""?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh.  No you didn't!
"
5 4 Kyle "Hell no! 
"
5 4 Kyle "Uh what are those? 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yuh huh!
"
5 4 Kyle "Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, can I give you some advice?
"
5 4 Kyle "Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
"
5 4 Kyle "One please.
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
"
5 4 Kyle "What's in it for us?
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, so what's the plan?
"
5 4 Kyle "...What?
"
5 4 Kyle "You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman?
"
5 4 Kyle "We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause, we're his friends.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause we hate him.
"
5 4 Kyle "Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
"
5 4 Kyle "Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah, sure. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
"
5 5 Kyle "Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
"
5 5 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
5 5 Kyle "Write the number down! Write the number down!!
"
5 5 Kyle "I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
"
5 5 Kyle "What??
"
5 5 Kyle "Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
5 5 Kyle "See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
"
5 5 Kyle "Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
"
5 5 Kyle "Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
"
5 5 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
"
5 5 Kyle "We have to talk to Terrance.
"
5 5 Kyle "Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Phillip, your partner.
"
5 5 Kyle "But the guy who replaced him sucks!
"
5 5 Kyle "But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uuuh, we didn't get them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
"
5 5 Kyle "They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ih-it'll be okay.
"
5 5 Kyle "They said they'd come.
"
5 5 Kyle "He's here! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"
5 5 Kyle "Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
"
5 5 Kyle "See? I told you it would work. 
"
5 5 Kyle "You can't leave! The show starts soon!
"
5 5 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 5 Kyle "Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
5 5 Kyle "Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
"
5 5 Kyle "Haaah! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"
5 6 Kyle """No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""
"
5 6 Kyle """Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!
"
5 6 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 6 Kyle "What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Kenny wasn't lying.
"
5 6 Kyle "Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"
5 6 Kyle "No... No, this isn't possible.
"
5 6 Kyle "No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Great. 
"
5 6 Kyle "It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
"
5 6 Kyle "So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hunh, I guess you're right.
"
5 6 Kyle "Where are we going?
"
5 6 Kyle "Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh God, get me off of here!! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
"
5 6 Kyle "My life can't get any worse!
"
5 6 Kyle "Lucky. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
"
5 6 Kyle "But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
"
5 6 Kyle "No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Agh!  Agghh! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Awesome. 
"
5 6 Kyle "I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
"
5 6 Kyle "Satan talked to God?
"
5 6 Kyle "And that's it? That's the end?
"
5 6 Kyle "That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"
5 6 Kyle "Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "You are up there! 
"
5 7 Kyle """No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""
"
5 7 Kyle """Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""
"
5 7 Kyle """AAAAAAAH!"" 
"
5 7 Kyle "What's this all about, Kenny?
"
5 7 Kyle "No they don't!
"
5 7 Kyle "That's awesome!
"
5 7 Kyle "You ""beat off?""
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?
"
5 7 Kyle "Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
"
5 7 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with them? 
"
5 7 Kyle "No.
"
5 7 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 7 Kyle "Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh my God, dude.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. Quick!
"
5 7 Kyle "Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
"
5 7 Kyle "Uh, what are ""studzes""
"
5 7 Kyle "It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
5 7 Kyle "Sure.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"
5 7 Kyle "You mean, intercourse with a girl?
"
5 7 Kyle "Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah! You get out of town!
"
5 7 Kyle "Man, he's pretty good.
"
5 7 Kyle "Seventeen? 
"
5 8 Kyle "HA! I killed you!
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
"
5 8 Kyle "Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
"
5 8 Kyle "Cool!
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
"
5 8 Kyle "Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!  Oh, crap.
"
5 8 Kyle "I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"
5 8 Kyle "I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Thanks, Towelie.
"
5 8 Kyle "Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay, turn it on.
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh, this is so cool.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
"
5 8 Kyle "She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh no.
"
5 8 Kyle "No we don't wanna get high!
"
5 8 Kyle "Me too.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
"
5 8 Kyle "What? You mean Towelie? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Where is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is it??
"
5 8 Kyle "What? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is he?
"
5 8 Kyle "What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's a towel call?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
"
5 8 Kyle "There he is!
"
5 8 Kyle "Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
5 8 Kyle "Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"
5 8 Kyle "Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
"
5 8 Kyle "Aw, God-damnit!
"
5 8 Kyle "Are we getting close?
"
5 8 Kyle "How long has it been since you've been back there.
"
5 8 Kyle "The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
"
5 8 Kyle "I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
"
5 8 Kyle "We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"
5 8 Kyle "All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
"
5 8 Kyle "Who's they?
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay.
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, I figured it out.
"
5 8 Kyle "If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
"
5 8 Kyle "Seven and a half.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Well let's look in here. 
"
5 8 Kyle "What terrifying secret?
"
5 8 Kyle "And we don't care.
"
5 8 Kyle "Go ahead. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Photon rifle, whatever. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Our GameSphere! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Sweet!
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
"
5 8 Kyle "I've almost got it!
"
5 8 Kyle "I got it! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!
"
5 8 Kyle "Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
"
5 9 Kyle "...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
"
5 9 Kyle "These are gas masks, Butters!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, what's going on?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
5 9 Kyle "Uh oh, they're closing!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey, wait! There are children in here!
"
5 9 Kyle "Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh God, it was horrible!
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"
5 9 Kyle "You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
"
5 9 Kyle "Is this the right house?
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
5 9 Kyle "Then why did you send us the goat?
"
5 9 Kyle "Jawas?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
"
5 9 Kyle "Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Good job, fatass!
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh crap, it's him!
"
5 9 Kyle "But I thought you hate us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, where are you going??
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, he's crazy!
"
5 9 Kyle "Where do we go? 
"
5 9 Kyle "All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
"
5 9 Kyle "Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "I'm confused.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
5 10 Kyle "I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
"
5 10 Kyle "No. This is taking forever.
"
5 10 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "It isn't that funny, Cartman.
"
5 10 Kyle "But I never take off my hat.
"
5 10 Kyle "This is how I look natural.
"
5 10 Kyle "Crap. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Gay-ass. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Why'd you call us?
"
5 10 Kyle "...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"
5 10 Kyle "No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
"
5 10 Kyle "...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
"
5 10 Kyle "...Nuh uh.
"
5 10 Kyle "Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
5 10 Kyle "Uh
"
5 10 Kyle "Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
"
5 10 Kyle "Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5 10 Kyle "Blew a funny fuse?
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
"
5 10 Kyle "You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
"
5 10 Kyle "Alright. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters!
"
5 10 Kyle "They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
"
5 10 Kyle "Dude, that poor kid. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
5 10 Kyle "Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
"
5 10 Kyle "Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
"
5 10 Kyle "Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's he look like?
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Hey dude.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh is, is this beef?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
"
5 11 Kyle "We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "I can't believe how cold it is out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"
5 11 Kyle "Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
5 11 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
"
5 11 Kyle "...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"
5 11 Kyle "Eh, oh, alright. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"
5 11 Kyle "Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 11 Kyle "But it's down in the snow.
"
5 11 Kyle "But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright, then. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh you did what? 
"
5 11 Kyle "You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
"
5 11 Kyle "Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
"
5 11 Kyle "Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Boy it sure is dry out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack!
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "It seems like I might get splinters, though.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
5 11 Kyle "I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a least a couple of hours.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!! 
"
5 11 Kyle "In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm back.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
"
5 11 Kyle "Re- really?
"
5 11 Kyle "Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
"
5 11 Kyle "I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
"
5 12 Kyle "Haha!
"
5 12 Kyle "Aharmani Exchange?
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
"
5 12 Kyle "What's a VHS? 
"
5 12 Kyle "Is that fun?
"
5 12 Kyle "Alright.
"
5 12 Kyle "I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Right.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being fat.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being stupid.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
"
5 12 Kyle "No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, that was pretty good. 
"
5 13 Kyle "'K go! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
"
5 13 Kyle "What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
5 13 Kyle "A trampoline?
"
5 13 Kyle "...What? 
"
5 13 Kyle "I'm leaving right now! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
"
5 13 Kyle "Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
"
5 13 Kyle "They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
"
5 13 Kyle "...I hate you so much. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
"
5 13 Kyle "We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
"
5 13 Kyle "Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
"
5 13 Kyle "Kenny's sick?
"
5 13 Kyle "Wait. Kenny's going to die?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
"
5 13 Kyle "They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey dude, how's it going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Dude, he needs us right now.
"
5 13 Kyle "I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
"
5 13 Kyle "Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan, you can't leave!
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman, were you... crying?
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
"
5 13 Kyle "...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
"
5 13 Kyle "Neat, huh Kenny?
"
5 13 Kyle "He said his wish is not to die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
"
5 13 Kyle "He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
5 13 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
"
5 13 Kyle "AAARGH! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Hey you guys! Look what I have!
"
5 1 Kyle "Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
"
5 1 Kyle "Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
"
5 1 Kyle "What, doughboy?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?!
"
5 1 Kyle "Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
5 1 Kyle "They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?
"
5 1 Kyle "Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
"
5 1 Kyle "It's stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
"
5 1 Kyle "Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
5 1 Kyle "How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
"
5 1 Kyle "I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "I don't really give a fuck! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"
5 1 Kyle "Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
"
5 1 Kyle "Oh, whatever. 
"
5 1 Kyle "This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
"
5 1 Kyle "There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
"
5 1 Kyle "Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.
"
5 1 Kyle "I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?
"
5 1 Kyle "No no! The word, ""shit"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.
"
5 1 Kyle "A... curse word.
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, this is serious!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
"
5 1 Kyle "...No.
"
5 1 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 1 Kyle "We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
5 1 Kyle "And asshole.
"
5 1 Kyle "Wait! 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
"
5 1 Kyle "You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
"
5 1 Kyle "We're all saying the S-word too much! 
"
5 1 Kyle "The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's pretty cool, dude!
"
5 3 Kyle "He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
"
5 3 Kyle "Wow, that's cool!
"
5 3 Kyle "Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
"
5 3 Kyle """David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not really happy.
"
5 3 Kyle "My potential hasn't even been reached.
"
5 3 Kyle "Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"
5 3 Kyle "We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
"
5 3 Kyle "So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm Kyle.
"
5 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
"
5 3 Kyle "But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
"
5 3 Kyle "What are we doing?
"
5 3 Kyle "Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
"
5 3 Kyle "It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
"
5 3 Kyle "Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not going anywhere!
"
5 3 Kyle "Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan.
"
5 3 Kyle "Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's right.
"
5 3 Kyle "...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
"
5 3 Kyle "David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
"
5 3 Kyle "How many tickets can we put you down for?
"
5 3 Kyle "Great!
"
5 3 Kyle "That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
5 3 Kyle "This is a really good turnout.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude, no way! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
5 3 Kyle "Yeah. Why is that good news?
"
5 3 Kyle "Mass suicide?
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
5 3 Kyle "It's just me.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
"
5 3 Kyle "Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
"
5 3 Kyle "What have you done, Cartman?!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, no!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Stan!
"
5 3 Kyle "I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Wagh. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"
5 3 Kyle "Haha, hehahaha.
"
5 4 Kyle "What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
5 4 Kyle "...What the hell are you talking about?!
"
5 4 Kyle "What's ""pubes""?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh.  No you didn't!
"
5 4 Kyle "Hell no! 
"
5 4 Kyle "Uh what are those? 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yuh huh!
"
5 4 Kyle "Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, can I give you some advice?
"
5 4 Kyle "Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
"
5 4 Kyle "One please.
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
"
5 4 Kyle "What's in it for us?
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, so what's the plan?
"
5 4 Kyle "...What?
"
5 4 Kyle "You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman?
"
5 4 Kyle "We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause, we're his friends.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause we hate him.
"
5 4 Kyle "Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
"
5 4 Kyle "Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah, sure. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
"
5 5 Kyle "Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
"
5 5 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
5 5 Kyle "Write the number down! Write the number down!!
"
5 5 Kyle "I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
"
5 5 Kyle "What??
"
5 5 Kyle "Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
5 5 Kyle "See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
"
5 5 Kyle "Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
"
5 5 Kyle "Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
"
5 5 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
"
5 5 Kyle "We have to talk to Terrance.
"
5 5 Kyle "Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Phillip, your partner.
"
5 5 Kyle "But the guy who replaced him sucks!
"
5 5 Kyle "But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uuuh, we didn't get them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
"
5 5 Kyle "They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ih-it'll be okay.
"
5 5 Kyle "They said they'd come.
"
5 5 Kyle "He's here! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"
5 5 Kyle "Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
"
5 5 Kyle "See? I told you it would work. 
"
5 5 Kyle "You can't leave! The show starts soon!
"
5 5 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 5 Kyle "Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
5 5 Kyle "Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
"
5 5 Kyle "Haaah! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"
5 6 Kyle """No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""
"
5 6 Kyle """Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!
"
5 6 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 6 Kyle "What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Kenny wasn't lying.
"
5 6 Kyle "Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"
5 6 Kyle "No... No, this isn't possible.
"
5 6 Kyle "No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Great. 
"
5 6 Kyle "It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
"
5 6 Kyle "So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hunh, I guess you're right.
"
5 6 Kyle "Where are we going?
"
5 6 Kyle "Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh God, get me off of here!! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
"
5 6 Kyle "My life can't get any worse!
"
5 6 Kyle "Lucky. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
"
5 6 Kyle "But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
"
5 6 Kyle "No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Agh!  Agghh! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Awesome. 
"
5 6 Kyle "I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
"
5 6 Kyle "Satan talked to God?
"
5 6 Kyle "And that's it? That's the end?
"
5 6 Kyle "That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"
5 6 Kyle "Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "You are up there! 
"
5 7 Kyle """No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""
"
5 7 Kyle """Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""
"
5 7 Kyle """AAAAAAAH!"" 
"
5 7 Kyle "What's this all about, Kenny?
"
5 7 Kyle "No they don't!
"
5 7 Kyle "That's awesome!
"
5 7 Kyle "You ""beat off?""
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?
"
5 7 Kyle "Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
"
5 7 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with them? 
"
5 7 Kyle "No.
"
5 7 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 7 Kyle "Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh my God, dude.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. Quick!
"
5 7 Kyle "Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
"
5 7 Kyle "Uh, what are ""studzes""
"
5 7 Kyle "It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
5 7 Kyle "Sure.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"
5 7 Kyle "You mean, intercourse with a girl?
"
5 7 Kyle "Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah! You get out of town!
"
5 7 Kyle "Man, he's pretty good.
"
5 7 Kyle "Seventeen? 
"
5 8 Kyle "HA! I killed you!
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
"
5 8 Kyle "Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
"
5 8 Kyle "Cool!
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
"
5 8 Kyle "Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!  Oh, crap.
"
5 8 Kyle "I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"
5 8 Kyle "I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Thanks, Towelie.
"
5 8 Kyle "Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay, turn it on.
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh, this is so cool.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
"
5 8 Kyle "She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh no.
"
5 8 Kyle "No we don't wanna get high!
"
5 8 Kyle "Me too.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
"
5 8 Kyle "What? You mean Towelie? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Where is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is it??
"
5 8 Kyle "What? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is he?
"
5 8 Kyle "What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's a towel call?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
"
5 8 Kyle "There he is!
"
5 8 Kyle "Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
5 8 Kyle "Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"
5 8 Kyle "Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
"
5 8 Kyle "Aw, God-damnit!
"
5 8 Kyle "Are we getting close?
"
5 8 Kyle "How long has it been since you've been back there.
"
5 8 Kyle "The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
"
5 8 Kyle "I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
"
5 8 Kyle "We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"
5 8 Kyle "All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
"
5 8 Kyle "Who's they?
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay.
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, I figured it out.
"
5 8 Kyle "If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
"
5 8 Kyle "Seven and a half.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Well let's look in here. 
"
5 8 Kyle "What terrifying secret?
"
5 8 Kyle "And we don't care.
"
5 8 Kyle "Go ahead. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Photon rifle, whatever. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Our GameSphere! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Sweet!
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
"
5 8 Kyle "I've almost got it!
"
5 8 Kyle "I got it! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!
"
5 8 Kyle "Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
"
5 9 Kyle "...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
"
5 9 Kyle "These are gas masks, Butters!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, what's going on?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
5 9 Kyle "Uh oh, they're closing!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey, wait! There are children in here!
"
5 9 Kyle "Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh God, it was horrible!
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"
5 9 Kyle "You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
"
5 9 Kyle "Is this the right house?
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
5 9 Kyle "Then why did you send us the goat?
"
5 9 Kyle "Jawas?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
"
5 9 Kyle "Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Good job, fatass!
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh crap, it's him!
"
5 9 Kyle "But I thought you hate us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, where are you going??
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, he's crazy!
"
5 9 Kyle "Where do we go? 
"
5 9 Kyle "All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
"
5 9 Kyle "Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "I'm confused.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
5 10 Kyle "I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
"
5 10 Kyle "No. This is taking forever.
"
5 10 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "It isn't that funny, Cartman.
"
5 10 Kyle "But I never take off my hat.
"
5 10 Kyle "This is how I look natural.
"
5 10 Kyle "Crap. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Gay-ass. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Why'd you call us?
"
5 10 Kyle "...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"
5 10 Kyle "No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
"
5 10 Kyle "...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
"
5 10 Kyle "...Nuh uh.
"
5 10 Kyle "Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
5 10 Kyle "Uh
"
5 10 Kyle "Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
"
5 10 Kyle "Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5 10 Kyle "Blew a funny fuse?
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
"
5 10 Kyle "You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
"
5 10 Kyle "Alright. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters!
"
5 10 Kyle "They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
"
5 10 Kyle "Dude, that poor kid. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
5 10 Kyle "Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
"
5 10 Kyle "Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
"
5 10 Kyle "Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's he look like?
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Hey dude.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh is, is this beef?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
"
5 11 Kyle "We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "I can't believe how cold it is out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"
5 11 Kyle "Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
5 11 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
"
5 11 Kyle "...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"
5 11 Kyle "Eh, oh, alright. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"
5 11 Kyle "Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 11 Kyle "But it's down in the snow.
"
5 11 Kyle "But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright, then. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh you did what? 
"
5 11 Kyle "You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
"
5 11 Kyle "Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
"
5 11 Kyle "Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Boy it sure is dry out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack!
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "It seems like I might get splinters, though.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
5 11 Kyle "I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a least a couple of hours.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!! 
"
5 11 Kyle "In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm back.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
"
5 11 Kyle "Re- really?
"
5 11 Kyle "Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
"
5 11 Kyle "I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
"
5 12 Kyle "Haha!
"
5 12 Kyle "Aharmani Exchange?
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
"
5 12 Kyle "What's a VHS? 
"
5 12 Kyle "Is that fun?
"
5 12 Kyle "Alright.
"
5 12 Kyle "I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Right.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being fat.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being stupid.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
"
5 12 Kyle "No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, that was pretty good. 
"
5 13 Kyle "'K go! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
"
5 13 Kyle "What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
5 13 Kyle "A trampoline?
"
5 13 Kyle "...What? 
"
5 13 Kyle "I'm leaving right now! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
"
5 13 Kyle "Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
"
5 13 Kyle "They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
"
5 13 Kyle "...I hate you so much. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
"
5 13 Kyle "We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
"
5 13 Kyle "Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
"
5 13 Kyle "Kenny's sick?
"
5 13 Kyle "Wait. Kenny's going to die?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
"
5 13 Kyle "They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey dude, how's it going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Dude, he needs us right now.
"
5 13 Kyle "I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
"
5 13 Kyle "Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan, you can't leave!
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman, were you... crying?
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
"
5 13 Kyle "...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
"
5 13 Kyle "Neat, huh Kenny?
"
5 13 Kyle "He said his wish is not to die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
"
5 13 Kyle "He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
5 13 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
"
5 13 Kyle "AAARGH! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Hey you guys! Look what I have!
"
5 1 Kyle "Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
"
5 1 Kyle "Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
"
5 1 Kyle "What, doughboy?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?
"
5 1 Kyle "What?!
"
5 1 Kyle "Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
5 1 Kyle "They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?
"
5 1 Kyle "Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
"
5 1 Kyle "It's stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
"
5 1 Kyle "Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
5 1 Kyle "How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
"
5 1 Kyle "I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
"
5 1 Kyle "I don't really give a fuck! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"
5 1 Kyle "Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
"
5 1 Kyle "Oh, whatever. 
"
5 1 Kyle "This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
"
5 1 Kyle "It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
"
5 1 Kyle "There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
"
5 1 Kyle "Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.
"
5 1 Kyle "I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
"
5 1 Kyle "Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?
"
5 1 Kyle "No no! The word, ""shit"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5 1 Kyle "Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.
"
5 1 Kyle "A... curse word.
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, this is serious!!!
"
5 1 Kyle "Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!
"
5 1 Kyle "Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
"
5 1 Kyle "We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
"
5 1 Kyle "...No.
"
5 1 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 1 Kyle "We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
5 1 Kyle "And asshole.
"
5 1 Kyle "Wait! 
"
5 1 Kyle "It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
"
5 1 Kyle "You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
"
5 1 Kyle "We're all saying the S-word too much! 
"
5 1 Kyle "The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's pretty cool, dude!
"
5 3 Kyle "He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
"
5 3 Kyle "Wow, that's cool!
"
5 3 Kyle "Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
"
5 3 Kyle """David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not really happy.
"
5 3 Kyle "My potential hasn't even been reached.
"
5 3 Kyle "Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"
5 3 Kyle "We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
"
5 3 Kyle "So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm Kyle.
"
5 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
"
5 3 Kyle "But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
"
5 3 Kyle "What are we doing?
"
5 3 Kyle "Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
"
5 3 Kyle "It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
"
5 3 Kyle "Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
"
5 3 Kyle "I'm not going anywhere!
"
5 3 Kyle "Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
"
5 3 Kyle "You're Stan.
"
5 3 Kyle "Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
"
5 3 Kyle "That's right.
"
5 3 Kyle "...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
"
5 3 Kyle "David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
"
5 3 Kyle "How many tickets can we put you down for?
"
5 3 Kyle "Great!
"
5 3 Kyle "That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
5 3 Kyle "This is a really good turnout.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude, no way! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
5 3 Kyle "Yeah. Why is that good news?
"
5 3 Kyle "Mass suicide?
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
5 3 Kyle "It's just me.
"
5 3 Kyle "Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
"
5 3 Kyle "I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
"
5 3 Kyle "Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
"
5 3 Kyle "What have you done, Cartman?!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
"
5 3 Kyle "Cartman, no!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 3 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Stan!
"
5 3 Kyle "I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
"
5 3 Kyle "Wagh. 
"
5 3 Kyle "Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"
5 3 Kyle "Haha, hehahaha.
"
5 4 Kyle "What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
5 4 Kyle "...What the hell are you talking about?!
"
5 4 Kyle "What's ""pubes""?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh.  No you didn't!
"
5 4 Kyle "Hell no! 
"
5 4 Kyle "Uh what are those? 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yuh huh!
"
5 4 Kyle "Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 4 Kyle "Cartman, can I give you some advice?
"
5 4 Kyle "Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
"
5 4 Kyle "One please.
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
"
5 4 Kyle "What's in it for us?
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
"
5 4 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!
"
5 4 Kyle "Okay, so what's the plan?
"
5 4 Kyle "...What?
"
5 4 Kyle "You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Scott Tenorman?
"
5 4 Kyle "We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause, we're his friends.
"
5 4 Kyle "'Cause we hate him.
"
5 4 Kyle "Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
"
5 4 Kyle "Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Yeah, sure. 
"
5 4 Kyle "Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
"
5 5 Kyle "Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
"
5 5 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
5 5 Kyle "Write the number down! Write the number down!!
"
5 5 Kyle "I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
"
5 5 Kyle "What??
"
5 5 Kyle "Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
5 5 Kyle "See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
"
5 5 Kyle "Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
"
5 5 Kyle "Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
"
5 5 Kyle "Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
"
5 5 Kyle "We have to talk to Terrance.
"
5 5 Kyle "Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
"
5 5 Kyle "Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Phillip, your partner.
"
5 5 Kyle "But the guy who replaced him sucks!
"
5 5 Kyle "But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
5 5 Kyle "Uuuh, we didn't get them.
"
5 5 Kyle "Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
"
5 5 Kyle "Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
"
5 5 Kyle "They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
"
5 5 Kyle "Ih-it'll be okay.
"
5 5 Kyle "They said they'd come.
"
5 5 Kyle "He's here! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"
5 5 Kyle "Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
"
5 5 Kyle "See? I told you it would work. 
"
5 5 Kyle "You can't leave! The show starts soon!
"
5 5 Kyle "You bastards!
"
5 5 Kyle "Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
5 5 Kyle "Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
"
5 5 Kyle "I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
"
5 5 Kyle "Haaah! 
"
5 5 Kyle "Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"
5 6 Kyle """No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""
"
5 6 Kyle """Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!
"
5 6 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 6 Kyle "What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Kenny wasn't lying.
"
5 6 Kyle "Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"
5 6 Kyle "No... No, this isn't possible.
"
5 6 Kyle "No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
"
5 6 Kyle "Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Great. 
"
5 6 Kyle "It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
"
5 6 Kyle "So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hunh, I guess you're right.
"
5 6 Kyle "Where are we going?
"
5 6 Kyle "Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"
5 6 Kyle "Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh God, get me off of here!! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
"
5 6 Kyle "My life can't get any worse!
"
5 6 Kyle "Lucky. 
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
"
5 6 Kyle "But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
5 6 Kyle "Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
"
5 6 Kyle "No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
"
5 6 Kyle "Agh!  Agghh! 
"
5 6 Kyle "Awesome. 
"
5 6 Kyle "I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
"
5 6 Kyle "Satan talked to God?
"
5 6 Kyle "And that's it? That's the end?
"
5 6 Kyle "That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"
5 6 Kyle "Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
"
5 6 Kyle "Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "Huh?
"
5 6 Kyle "You are up there! 
"
5 7 Kyle """No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""
"
5 7 Kyle """Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""
"
5 7 Kyle """AAAAAAAH!"" 
"
5 7 Kyle "What's this all about, Kenny?
"
5 7 Kyle "No they don't!
"
5 7 Kyle "That's awesome!
"
5 7 Kyle "You ""beat off?""
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?
"
5 7 Kyle "Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
"
5 7 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with them? 
"
5 7 Kyle "No.
"
5 7 Kyle "Nuh uh.
"
5 7 Kyle "Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh my God, dude.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. Quick!
"
5 7 Kyle "Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
5 7 Kyle "Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
"
5 7 Kyle "Uh, what are ""studzes""
"
5 7 Kyle "It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
5 7 Kyle "Sure.
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"
5 7 Kyle "You mean, intercourse with a girl?
"
5 7 Kyle "Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
"
5 7 Kyle "Yeah! You get out of town!
"
5 7 Kyle "Man, he's pretty good.
"
5 7 Kyle "Seventeen? 
"
5 8 Kyle "HA! I killed you!
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
"
5 8 Kyle "Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
"
5 8 Kyle "Cool!
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
"
5 8 Kyle "Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!  Oh, crap.
"
5 8 Kyle "I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"
5 8 Kyle "I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Thanks, Towelie.
"
5 8 Kyle "Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay, turn it on.
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh, this is so cool.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
"
5 8 Kyle "She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh no.
"
5 8 Kyle "No we don't wanna get high!
"
5 8 Kyle "Me too.
"
5 8 Kyle "Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
"
5 8 Kyle "What? You mean Towelie? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Where is it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is it??
"
5 8 Kyle "What? 
"
5 8 Kyle "Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
"
5 8 Kyle "Where the hell is he?
"
5 8 Kyle "What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's a towel call?
"
5 8 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
"
5 8 Kyle "There he is!
"
5 8 Kyle "Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
5 8 Kyle "Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"
5 8 Kyle "Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
"
5 8 Kyle "Aw, God-damnit!
"
5 8 Kyle "Are we getting close?
"
5 8 Kyle "How long has it been since you've been back there.
"
5 8 Kyle "The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
"
5 8 Kyle "I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
"
5 8 Kyle "We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"
5 8 Kyle "All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
"
5 8 Kyle "Who's they?
"
5 8 Kyle "Okay.
"
5 8 Kyle "Dude, I figured it out.
"
5 8 Kyle "If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
"
5 8 Kyle "Seven and a half.
"
5 8 Kyle "That's it?
"
5 8 Kyle "Well let's look in here. 
"
5 8 Kyle "What terrifying secret?
"
5 8 Kyle "And we don't care.
"
5 8 Kyle "Go ahead. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Photon rifle, whatever. 
"
5 8 Kyle "Our GameSphere! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Sweet!
"
5 8 Kyle "Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
"
5 8 Kyle "I've almost got it!
"
5 8 Kyle "I got it! 
"
5 8 Kyle "Awesome!
"
5 8 Kyle "Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
"
5 9 Kyle "...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
"
5 9 Kyle "These are gas masks, Butters!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, what's going on?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
5 9 Kyle "Uh oh, they're closing!
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey, wait! There are children in here!
"
5 9 Kyle "Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh God, it was horrible!
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"
5 9 Kyle "You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
"
5 9 Kyle "Is this the right house?
"
5 9 Kyle "Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
5 9 Kyle "Then why did you send us the goat?
"
5 9 Kyle "Jawas?
"
5 9 Kyle "Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
"
5 9 Kyle "Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
5 9 Kyle "Good job, fatass!
"
5 9 Kyle "Oh crap, it's him!
"
5 9 Kyle "But I thought you hate us.
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, where are you going??
"
5 9 Kyle "Cartman, he's crazy!
"
5 9 Kyle "Where do we go? 
"
5 9 Kyle "All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
"
5 9 Kyle "Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "I'm confused.
"
5 9 Kyle "Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
"
5 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
5 9 Kyle "Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
5 10 Kyle "I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
"
5 10 Kyle "No. This is taking forever.
"
5 10 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "It isn't that funny, Cartman.
"
5 10 Kyle "But I never take off my hat.
"
5 10 Kyle "This is how I look natural.
"
5 10 Kyle "Crap. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Gay-ass. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Hello?
"
5 10 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 10 Kyle "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Why'd you call us?
"
5 10 Kyle "...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"
5 10 Kyle "No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
"
5 10 Kyle "...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
"
5 10 Kyle "...Nuh uh.
"
5 10 Kyle "Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
5 10 Kyle "Uh
"
5 10 Kyle "Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
"
5 10 Kyle "Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5 10 Kyle "Blew a funny fuse?
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
"
5 10 Kyle "You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
"
5 10 Kyle "Alright. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Butters! Hey Butters!
"
5 10 Kyle "They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
"
5 10 Kyle "Dude, that poor kid. 
"
5 10 Kyle "Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
5 10 Kyle "Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
"
5 10 Kyle "Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
"
5 10 Kyle "There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
"
5 10 Kyle "Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's he look like?
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Hey dude.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh is, is this beef?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
"
5 11 Kyle "We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
"
5 11 Kyle "What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "I can't believe how cold it is out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"
5 11 Kyle "Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
5 11 Kyle "Cartman?!
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
"
5 11 Kyle "...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"
5 11 Kyle "Eh, oh, alright. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"
5 11 Kyle "Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
"
5 11 Kyle "Now what?
"
5 11 Kyle "But it's down in the snow.
"
5 11 Kyle "But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"
5 11 Kyle "Alright, then. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh you did what? 
"
5 11 Kyle "You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
"
5 11 Kyle "Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
"
5 11 Kyle "Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Boy it sure is dry out here.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack!
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "It seems like I might get splinters, though.
"
5 11 Kyle "Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
5 11 Kyle "I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
"
5 11 Kyle "It's a least a couple of hours.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm ba-ack.
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
"
5 11 Kyle "I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
"
5 11 Kyle "Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus!! 
"
5 11 Kyle "In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
"
5 11 Kyle "Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
"
5 11 Kyle "Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
"
5 11 Kyle "I'm back.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
"
5 11 Kyle "Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
"
5 11 Kyle "Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
"
5 11 Kyle "Re- really?
"
5 11 Kyle "Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
"
5 11 Kyle "I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
"
5 12 Kyle "Haha!
"
5 12 Kyle "Aharmani Exchange?
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
"
5 12 Kyle "What's a VHS? 
"
5 12 Kyle "Is that fun?
"
5 12 Kyle "Alright.
"
5 12 Kyle "I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
"
5 12 Kyle "Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Right.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being fat.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being stupid.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
"
5 12 Kyle "And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
"
5 12 Kyle "No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
5 12 Kyle "Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, that was pretty good. 
"
5 13 Kyle "'K go! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
"
5 13 Kyle "What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
5 13 Kyle "A trampoline?
"
5 13 Kyle "...What? 
"
5 13 Kyle "I'm leaving right now! 
"
5 13 Kyle "You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
"
5 13 Kyle "Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
"
5 13 Kyle "They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
"
5 13 Kyle "...I hate you so much. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
"
5 13 Kyle "We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
"
5 13 Kyle "Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
"
5 13 Kyle "Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
"
5 13 Kyle "Kenny's sick?
"
5 13 Kyle "Wait. Kenny's going to die?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
"
5 13 Kyle "They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey dude, how's it going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
"
5 13 Kyle "Dude, he needs us right now.
"
5 13 Kyle "I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
"
5 13 Kyle "Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan, you can't leave!
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "Cartman, were you... crying?
"
5 13 Kyle "Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
"
5 13 Kyle "Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
"
5 13 Kyle "...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
5 13 Kyle "Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
"
5 13 Kyle "Neat, huh Kenny?
"
5 13 Kyle "He said his wish is not to die. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
"
5 13 Kyle "He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
"
5 13 Kyle "He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
5 13 Kyle "What, Cartman?
"
5 13 Kyle "I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
"
5 13 Kyle "AAARGH! 
"
