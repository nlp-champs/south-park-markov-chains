5 1 Cartman "You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
"
5 1 Cartman "I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
"
5 1 Cartman "So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
"
5 1 Cartman "No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
"
5 1 Cartman "You'll never guess.
"
5 1 Cartman "Guess.
"
5 1 Cartman "You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit.""
"
5 1 Cartman "It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
"
5 1 Cartman "Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
"
5 1 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!
"
5 1 Cartman "Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
"
5 1 Cartman "Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!
"
5 1 Cartman "I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
"
5 1 Cartman "Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
"
5 1 Cartman "Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
"
5 1 Cartman "Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
"
5 1 Cartman "Huh?
"
5 1 Cartman "I don't get it.
"
5 1 Cartman "Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
"
5 1 Cartman "Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
"
5 1 Cartman "Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
"
5 1 Cartman "You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
"
5 1 Cartman "Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
"
5 1 Cartman "Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
"
5 1 Cartman "You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"
5 1 Cartman "So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh-Ho, gross!
"
5 1 Cartman "Kenny's got it. heh heh.
"
5 1 Cartman "Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
"
5 1 Cartman "But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
"
5 1 Cartman "I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
"
5 1 Cartman "My house, too?
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
"
5 1 Cartman "What a stupid voice.
"
5 1 Cartman "So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Hah, I love you guys.
"
5 2 Cartman "That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, he's excited.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hey, Butters.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hey, yeah!
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
"
5 2 Cartman "Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hehe, I don't sound like that.
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Awww!
"
5 2 Cartman "Man, this guy sucks.
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
"
5 2 Cartman "But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
"
5 2 Cartman "Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight!
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Eh, we kick ass.
"
5 3 Cartman "Who's this asshole?
"
5 3 Cartman "Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
"
5 3 Cartman "Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
"
5 3 Cartman "When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
"
5 3 Cartman "Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
"
5 3 Cartman "Cool.
"
5 3 Cartman "Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
"
5 3 Cartman "Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
"
5 3 Cartman "Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
"
5 3 Cartman "Cool. 
"
5 3 Cartman "Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
"
5 3 Cartman "He's going to eat his own head.
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
"
5 3 Cartman "Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
"
5 3 Cartman "What's he doin' here? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Now how the hell did he do that? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
"
5 3 Cartman "No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
"
5 3 Cartman "What?
"
5 3 Cartman "Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
"
5 3 Cartman "That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
"
5 3 Cartman "I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
"
5 3 Cartman "This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
"
5 3 Cartman "Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
"
5 3 Cartman "At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
"
5 3 Cartman "Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
"
5 3 Cartman "But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
"
5 3 Cartman "Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
"
5 3 Cartman "Hey, I was just about to do it.
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
"
5 3 Cartman "Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
"
5 4 Cartman "You wanna see 'em?
"
5 4 Cartman "Here, check 'em out.
"
5 4 Cartman "There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
"
5 4 Cartman "My pubes.
"
5 4 Cartman "I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
"
5 4 Cartman "Uh oo what?
"
5 4 Cartman "Nuh uh!
"
5 4 Cartman "But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
"
5 4 Cartman "You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
"
5 4 Cartman "Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
"
5 4 Cartman "Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
"
5 4 Cartman "Just give me back my money...
"
5 4 Cartman "Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
"
5 4 Cartman "Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
"
5 4 Cartman "You will? Oh, cool!
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
"
5 4 Cartman "...Okay.
"
5 4 Cartman "Right.
"
5 4 Cartman "Cool.

5 4 Cartman "Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
"
5 4 Cartman "That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?!
"
5 4 Cartman "He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "One please. 
"
5 4 Cartman "O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
"
5 4 Cartman "Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
"
5 4 Cartman "Racist! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
"
5 4 Cartman "I don't believe you.
"
5 4 Cartman "Pube fair?
"
5 4 Cartman "Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
"
5 4 Cartman "Haha, charade you are, Scott! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
"
5 4 Cartman "Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
"
5 4 Cartman "No- no such thing?
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm Eric Cartman!
"
5 4 Cartman "Aaah!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah. Poor grandma...
"
5 4 Cartman "Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! 
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh?
"
5 4 Cartman "Why??
"
5 4 Cartman "Please Scott give me my money.
"
5 4 Cartman "I beg you to give me back my money.
"
5 4 Cartman "What?!
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm a little piggy.
"
5 4 Cartman "Here's my snout.
"
5 4 Cartman "Oink oink oink.
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
"
5 4 Cartman "What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?
"
5 4 Cartman "Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
"
5 4 Cartman "Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!
"
5 4 Cartman "Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
"
5 4 Cartman "Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
"
5 4 Cartman "There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
"
5 4 Cartman "No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
"
5 4 Cartman "He said it was okay.
"
5 4 Cartman "Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
"
5 4 Cartman "Not like that, pony! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Whattayou mean?
"
5 4 Cartman "How do I do that?
"
5 4 Cartman "I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
"
5 4 Cartman "You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
"
5 4 Cartman "So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
"
5 4 Cartman "Whoa!
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
"
5 4 Cartman "Radiohead. Yes, of course. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!
"
5 4 Cartman "You're welcome, Scott. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
"
5 4 Cartman "That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? 
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
"
5 4 Cartman "Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
"
5 4 Cartman "'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' 
"
5 4 Cartman "That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
"
5 4 Cartman "How to get Scott Tenorman back!
"
5 4 Cartman "I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
"
5 4 Cartman "It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
"
5 4 Cartman "So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Hello, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
"
5 4 Cartman "A little penis-biting, perhaps?
"
5 4 Cartman "Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
"
5 4 Cartman "Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
"
5 4 Cartman "Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
"
5 4 Cartman "What's so funny?
"
5 4 Cartman "Not yet, but they will be.
"
5 4 Cartman "Hey, Chef.
"
5 4 Cartman "What contest?
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
"
5 4 Cartman "Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright.  Hey, this is great! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
"
5 4 Cartman "Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 
"
5 4 Cartman "I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""
"
5 4 Cartman "Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Whoa, bummer, dude.
"
5 5 Cartman "Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
"
5 5 Cartman "You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
"
5 5 Cartman "Awesome! Give me mine! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Well yeah, dude.
"
5 5 Cartman "Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
"
5 5 Cartman "I think this new guy's funny.
"
5 5 Cartman "Aw, dude, gay!
"
5 5 Cartman "Racist! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Don't talk to us, kid.
"
5 5 Cartman "Kenny's a random slut. 
"
5 5 Cartman "Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Weak.
"
5 5 Cartman "Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5 5 Cartman "Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
"
5 5 Cartman "We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
"
5 5 Cartman "Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
"
5 5 Cartman "Alright!
"
5 5 Cartman "Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
"
5 6 Cartman "Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
"
5 6 Cartman "Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
"
5 6 Cartman "God! She didn't take this long to die.
"
5 6 Cartman "Great. Now can we go?
"
5 6 Cartman "Ogh! God-damnit..!
"
5 6 Cartman "Mom, I wanna go home!
"
5 6 Cartman "Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"
5 6 Cartman "Hoosajiggawha?
"
5 6 Cartman "Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
"
5 6 Cartman "No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
"
5 6 Cartman "Egh... 
"
5 6 Cartman "Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
"
5 6 Cartman "I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
"
5 6 Cartman "On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
"
5 6 Cartman "Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
"
5 6 Cartman "Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
"
5 6 Cartman "Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
"
5 6 Cartman "Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
"
5 6 Cartman "HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
"
5 6 Cartman "Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
"
5 6 Cartman "My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
"
5 6 Cartman "What?!
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
"
5 6 Cartman "No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
"
5 6 Cartman "Gentlemen, I thank you.
"
5 6 Cartman "Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!

"
5 6 Cartman "Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
"
5 6 Cartman "Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
"
5 6 Cartman "What the hell?
"
5 6 Cartman "You sons of bitches! 
"
5 6 Cartman "What the hell are you doing?!
"
5 6 Cartman "That's right! You stay out!
"
5 6 Cartman "...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
"
5 6 Cartman "But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
"
5 6 Cartman "Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
"
5 6 Cartman "Ugh... Two people?
"
5 6 Cartman "Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
"
5 6 Cartman "Sweet.
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 
"
5 6 Cartman "I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
"
5 6 Cartman "The rest of you will just have to try another day.
"
5 6 Cartman "'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
"
5 6 Cartman "...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
"
5 6 Cartman "Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
"
5 6 Cartman "Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I don't know how it works.
"
5 6 Cartman "Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 
"
5 6 Cartman "Wait a minute! Who are you?
"
5 6 Cartman "HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
"
5 6 Cartman "I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
"
5 6 Cartman "Get him out of here! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
"
5 6 Cartman "...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 
"
5 6 Cartman "AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!
"
5 6 Cartman "Hey, there you are! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Just give me my money back.
"
5 6 Cartman "I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
"
5 6 Cartman "You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
"
5 6 Cartman "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5 6 Cartman "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
5 6 Cartman "He-hey, that's my money!
"
5 6 Cartman "What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
"
5 6 Cartman "Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
"
5 6 Cartman "No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
"
5 6 Cartman "This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
"
5 6 Cartman "It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 
"
5 6 Cartman "You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
"
5 6 Cartman "I'M SO PISSED OFF! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
"
5 6 Cartman "It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
"
5 7 Cartman "Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
"
5 7 Cartman "No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
"
5 7 Cartman "Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
"
5 7 Cartman "I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
"
5 7 Cartman "I told you guys.
"
5 7 Cartman "Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
"
5 7 Cartman "That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
"
5 7 Cartman "AIDS?
"
5 7 Cartman "Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
"
5 7 Cartman "Just put it on, Butters.
"
5 7 Cartman "Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
"
5 7 Cartman "I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
"
5 7 Cartman "Do you feel protected?
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
"
5 7 Cartman "I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
"
5 7 Cartman "So I don't get AIDS.
"
5 7 Cartman "I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
"
5 7 Cartman "Here, talk to them, Butters.
"
5 7 Cartman "Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
"
5 7 Cartman "Oh, bitch!
"
5 7 Cartman "Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
"
5 7 Cartman "Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
"
5 8 Cartman "Let a man take a crap!
"
5 8 Cartman "I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
"
5 8 Cartman "Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
"
5 8 Cartman "Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Why?
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
"
5 8 Cartman "This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
"
5 8 Cartman "Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
"
5 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
"
5 8 Cartman "Bring it, bring it! 
"
5 8 Cartman "Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
"
5 8 Cartman "Date-rape psychosis.
"
5 8 Cartman "Awesome!
"
5 8 Cartman "We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
"
5 8 Cartman "Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! 
"
5 8 Cartman "That's... so... cool!
"
5 8 Cartman "It's Monday?
"
5 8 Cartman "What, dude? 
"
5 8 Cartman "Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
"
5 8 Cartman "No! ...No!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey, towel!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
"
5 8 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
5 8 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
5 8 Cartman "Egh!
"
5 8 Cartman "This is where you came from?
"
5 8 Cartman "Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
"
5 8 Cartman "Alright, I think we go over there. 
"
5 8 Cartman "You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
"
5 8 Cartman "I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
"
5 8 Cartman "Yeah, and you're a towel!
"
5 8 Cartman "We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
"
5 8 Cartman "Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
"
5 8 Cartman "Could you turn it up?
"
5 8 Cartman "Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Kenny!
"
5 8 Cartman "Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hooray!
"
5 8 Cartman "You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
"
5 9 Cartman "...Not really.
"
5 9 Cartman "Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
"
5 9 Cartman "Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
"
5 9 Cartman "God-damnit! 
"
5 9 Cartman "HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
"
5 9 Cartman "That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
"
5 9 Cartman "Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
"
5 9 Cartman "God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
"
5 9 Cartman "Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
"
5 9 Cartman "Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
"
5 9 Cartman "It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh no, not Towelie.
"
5 9 Cartman "No, we don't wanna get high!!
"
5 9 Cartman "That's right!
"
5 9 Cartman "Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
"
5 9 Cartman "Aw, son of a bitch!
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh ho, you guys.
"
5 9 Cartman "It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh, whatever!
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
"
5 9 Cartman "God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
"
5 9 Cartman "What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
"
5 9 Cartman "It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 
"
5 9 Cartman "What did you call us?!
"
5 9 Cartman "I told you! Jawas have no heart.
"
5 9 Cartman "You know, sand people.
"
5 9 Cartman "God, I hate you so much, Stan!
"
5 9 Cartman "Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
"
5 9 Cartman "Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
"
5 9 Cartman "Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
"
5 9 Cartman "I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
"
5 9 Cartman "He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
"
5 9 Cartman "Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh oh! Mmm-mm! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Hey look! An infidel! 
"
5 9 Cartman "So that's what this is all about?
"
5 9 Cartman "Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
"
5 9 Cartman "Woohoo! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu. 
"
5 9 Cartman "There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
"
5 9 Cartman "Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone.

5 9 Cartman "Yeah.

5 10 Cartman "You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!

5 10 Cartman "...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
"
5 10 Cartman "Uh oh. 
"
5 10 Cartman "Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?

5 10 Cartman "Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!

5 10 Cartman "YES! YES!

5 10 Cartman "Let me see! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
"
5 10 Cartman "Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
"
5 10 Cartman "I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
"
5 10 Cartman "Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
"
5 10 Cartman "Yes, I have it right hmya.

5 10 Cartman "You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.

5 10 Cartman "Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!

5 10 Cartman "No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
"
5 10 Cartman "No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh.

5 10 Cartman "Oh God.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh my... God. 
"
5 10 Cartman "You guys, something's wrong.
"
5 10 Cartman "I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
"
5 10 Cartman "It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
"
5 10 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
"
5 10 Cartman "Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
"
5 10 Cartman "You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
"
5 10 Cartman "Ugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh, dude, oh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
"
5 10 Cartman "Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
"
5 10 Cartman "I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, let me have it.
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, why?
"
5 10 Cartman "...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
"
5 10 Cartman "Who's there?
"
5 10 Cartman "Orange who?
"
5 10 Cartman "...naw, that didn't work either.
"
5 10 Cartman "Who's there?
"
5 10 Cartman "An interrupting cow who
"
5 10 Cartman "Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
"
5 10 Cartman "And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
"
5 10 Cartman "Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
"
5 10 Cartman "What's goin' on?
"
5 10 Cartman "Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
"
5 10 Cartman "Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
"
5 10 Cartman "A-heh, what?
"
5 10 Cartman "E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
"
5 10 Cartman "Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 
"
5 11 Cartman "What's that thing?
"
5 11 Cartman "What?
"
5 11 Cartman "Forty bucks?
"
5 11 Cartman "Alright, alright.
"
5 11 Cartman "Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
"
5 11 Cartman "Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
"
5 11 Cartman "...Oh, man.
"
5 11 Cartman "Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
"
5 11 Cartman "Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
"
5 11 Cartman "I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
"
5 11 Cartman "Ugh, ugh!
"
5 11 Cartman "Oh!
"
5 11 Cartman "Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
"
5 11 Cartman "Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
"
5 11 Cartman "Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
"
5 11 Cartman "No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
"
5 11 Cartman "Goddamnit, give me another chance!
"
5 11 Cartman "Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
"
5 11 Cartman "He's faaahn.
"
5 11 Cartman "1, 2, 3, 4...
"
5 11 Cartman "He's faaahn.
"
5 11 Cartman "Heheheheheh. 
"
5 11 Cartman "I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
"
5 11 Cartman "...Good job, Jew!
"
5 12 Cartman "Stand by, please.
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, god dammit!
"
5 12 Cartman "Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
"
5 12 Cartman "I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5 12 Cartman "Nothing! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Aw, that is such bullcrap!
"
5 12 Cartman "No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
"
5 12 Cartman "Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
"
5 12 Cartman "All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
"
5 12 Cartman "Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
"
5 12 Cartman "Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, dude. 
"
5 12 Cartman "What in the hell are they doing?
"
5 12 Cartman "Well, let's just play our game, then.
"
5 12 Cartman "Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Kick his nutsack! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
5 12 Cartman "Yeah.
"
5 12 Cartman "Hey.
"
5 12 Cartman "Ey, you did me already!
"
5 12 Cartman "Pussy. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
"
5 13 Cartman "Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
"
5 13 Cartman "Mint condition, tax free.
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
"
5 13 Cartman "Stem cells, numbnuts!
"
5 13 Cartman "It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
"
5 13 Cartman "Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
"
5 13 Cartman "Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
"
5 13 Cartman "Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
"
5 13 Cartman "You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
"
5 13 Cartman "...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
"
5 13 Cartman "Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
"
5 13 Cartman "Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
"
5 13 Cartman "Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
"
5 13 Cartman "Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
"
5 13 Cartman "Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
"
5 13 Cartman "What is this, a PTA meeting? 
"
5 13 Cartman "In the ...hospital? Why?
"
5 13 Cartman "Die? Kenny?
"
5 13 Cartman "Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
"
5 13 Cartman "We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
"
5 13 Cartman "Heh, sorry. 
"
5 13 Cartman "...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
"
5 13 Cartman "Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
"
5 13 Cartman "' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
"
5 13 Cartman "I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
"
5 13 Cartman "Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
"
5 13 Cartman "Not at all, but go on. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My God...
"
5 13 Cartman "So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
"
5 13 Cartman "Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
"
5 13 Cartman "Hmmm.
"
5 13 Cartman "Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 
"
5 13 Cartman "There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
"
5 13 Cartman "And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
"
5 13 Cartman "Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
"
5 13 Cartman "Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
"
5 13 Cartman "Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
"
5 13 Cartman "You guys! Come quick! 
"
5 13 Cartman "It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
"
5 13 Cartman "I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
"
5 13 Cartman "Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 
"
5 14 Cartman "Huho!
"
5 14 Cartman "We sure are.
"
5 1 Cartman "You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
"
5 1 Cartman "I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
"
5 1 Cartman "So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
"
5 1 Cartman "No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
"
5 1 Cartman "You'll never guess.
"
5 1 Cartman "Guess.
"
5 1 Cartman "You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit.""
"
5 1 Cartman "It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
"
5 1 Cartman "Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
"
5 1 Cartman "Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!
"
5 1 Cartman "Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
"
5 1 Cartman "Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!
"
5 1 Cartman "I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
"
5 1 Cartman "Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
"
5 1 Cartman "Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
"
5 1 Cartman "Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
"
5 1 Cartman "Huh?
"
5 1 Cartman "I don't get it.
"
5 1 Cartman "Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
"
5 1 Cartman "Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
"
5 1 Cartman "Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
"
5 1 Cartman "You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
"
5 1 Cartman "Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
"
5 1 Cartman "Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
"
5 1 Cartman "You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"
5 1 Cartman "So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh-Ho, gross!
"
5 1 Cartman "Kenny's got it. heh heh.
"
5 1 Cartman "Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
"
5 1 Cartman "But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
"
5 1 Cartman "I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
"
5 1 Cartman "My house, too?
"
5 1 Cartman "Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
"
5 1 Cartman "What a stupid voice.
"
5 1 Cartman "So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 
"
5 1 Cartman "Hah, I love you guys.
"
5 2 Cartman "That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, he's excited.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hey, Butters.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hey, yeah!
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
"
5 2 Cartman "Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
"
5 2 Cartman "Hehe, I don't sound like that.
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Awww!
"
5 2 Cartman "Man, this guy sucks.
"
5 2 Cartman "Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
"
5 2 Cartman "But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
"
5 2 Cartman "Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight!
"
5 2 Cartman "Cripple fight! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! 
"
5 2 Cartman "Eh, we kick ass.
"
5 3 Cartman "Who's this asshole?
"
5 3 Cartman "Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
"
5 3 Cartman "Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
"
5 3 Cartman "When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
"
5 3 Cartman "Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
"
5 3 Cartman "Cool.
"
5 3 Cartman "Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
"
5 3 Cartman "Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
"
5 3 Cartman "Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
"
5 3 Cartman "Cool. 
"
5 3 Cartman "Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
"
5 3 Cartman "He's going to eat his own head.
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "No you're not.
"
5 3 Cartman "Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
"
5 3 Cartman "Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
"
5 3 Cartman "What's he doin' here? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Now how the hell did he do that? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
"
5 3 Cartman "No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
"
5 3 Cartman "Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
"
5 3 Cartman "What?
"
5 3 Cartman "Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
"
5 3 Cartman "That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
"
5 3 Cartman "I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
"
5 3 Cartman "This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
"
5 3 Cartman "Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
"
5 3 Cartman "At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
"
5 3 Cartman "Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
"
5 3 Cartman "But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
"
5 3 Cartman "Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
"
5 3 Cartman "Hey, I was just about to do it.
"
5 3 Cartman "Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
"
5 3 Cartman "Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
"
5 4 Cartman "You wanna see 'em?
"
5 4 Cartman "Here, check 'em out.
"
5 4 Cartman "There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
"
5 4 Cartman "My pubes.
"
5 4 Cartman "I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
"
5 4 Cartman "Uh oo what?
"
5 4 Cartman "Nuh uh!
"
5 4 Cartman "But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
"
5 4 Cartman "You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
"
5 4 Cartman "Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
"
5 4 Cartman "Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
"
5 4 Cartman "Just give me back my money...
"
5 4 Cartman "Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
"
5 4 Cartman "Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
"
5 4 Cartman "You will? Oh, cool!
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
"
5 4 Cartman "...Okay.
"
5 4 Cartman "Right.
"
5 4 Cartman "Cool.

5 4 Cartman "Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
"
5 4 Cartman "That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?!

5 4 Cartman "He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "One please. 
"
5 4 Cartman "O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
"
5 4 Cartman "Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
"
5 4 Cartman "Racist! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
"
5 4 Cartman "I don't believe you.
"
5 4 Cartman "Pube fair?
"
5 4 Cartman "Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
"
5 4 Cartman "Haha, charade you are, Scott!

5 4 Cartman "Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!

"
5 4 Cartman "I'm Eric Cartman!
"
5 4 Cartman "Aaah!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah. Poor grandma...
"
5 4 Cartman "Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! 
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh?
"
5 4 Cartman "Why??
"
5 4 Cartman "Please Scott give me my money.
"
5 4 Cartman "I beg you to give me back my money.
"
5 4 Cartman "What?!
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm a little piggy.
"
5 4 Cartman "Here's my snout.
"
5 4 Cartman "Oink oink oink.

5 4 Cartman "I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's

5 4 Cartman "Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
"
5 4 Cartman "Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!
"
5 4 Cartman "Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
"
5 4 Cartman "Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "What?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
"
5 4 Cartman "There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
"
5 4 Cartman "No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
"
5 4 Cartman "He said it was okay.
"
5 4 Cartman "Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
"
5 4 Cartman "Not like that, pony! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Whattayou mean?
"
5 4 Cartman "How do I do that?
"
5 4 Cartman "I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
"
5 4 Cartman "You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
"
5 4 Cartman "So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
"
5 4 Cartman "Whoa!
"
5 4 Cartman "I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
"
5 4 Cartman "Radiohead. Yes, of course. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!
"
5 4 Cartman "You're welcome, Scott. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
"
5 4 Cartman "That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? 
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
"
5 4 Cartman "Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
"
5 4 Cartman "'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' 
"
5 4 Cartman "That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
"
5 4 Cartman "Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
"
5 4 Cartman "How to get Scott Tenorman back!
"
5 4 Cartman "I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
"
5 4 Cartman "It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
"
5 4 Cartman "So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Hello, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
"
5 4 Cartman "Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
"
5 4 Cartman "A little penis-biting, perhaps?
"
5 4 Cartman "Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
"
5 4 Cartman "Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
"
5 4 Cartman "Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
"
5 4 Cartman "What's so funny?
"
5 4 Cartman "Not yet, but they will be.
"
5 4 Cartman "Hey, Chef.
"
5 4 Cartman "What contest?
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
"
5 4 Cartman "Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
"
5 4 Cartman "Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!
"
5 4 Cartman "Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
"
5 4 Cartman "Alright.  Hey, this is great! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
"
5 4 Cartman "What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
"
5 4 Cartman "Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 
"
5 4 Cartman "I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""
"
5 4 Cartman "Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 
"
5 4 Cartman "Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
"
5 4 Cartman "Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Whoa, bummer, dude.
"
5 5 Cartman "Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
"
5 5 Cartman "You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
"
5 5 Cartman "Awesome! Give me mine! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Well yeah, dude.
"
5 5 Cartman "Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
"
5 5 Cartman "I think this new guy's funny.
"
5 5 Cartman "Aw, dude, gay!
"
5 5 Cartman "Racist! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Don't talk to us, kid.
"
5 5 Cartman "Kenny's a random slut. 
"
5 5 Cartman "Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 
"
5 5 Cartman "Weak.
"
5 5 Cartman "Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5 5 Cartman "Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
"
5 5 Cartman "We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
"
5 5 Cartman "Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
"
5 5 Cartman "Alright!
"
5 5 Cartman "Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
"
5 6 Cartman "Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
"
5 6 Cartman "Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
"
5 6 Cartman "God! She didn't take this long to die.
"
5 6 Cartman "Great. Now can we go?
"
5 6 Cartman "Ogh! God-damnit..!
"
5 6 Cartman "Mom, I wanna go home!
"
5 6 Cartman "Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"
5 6 Cartman "Hoosajiggawha?
"
5 6 Cartman "Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
"
5 6 Cartman "No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
"
5 6 Cartman "Egh... 
"
5 6 Cartman "Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
"
5 6 Cartman "I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
"
5 6 Cartman "On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
"
5 6 Cartman "Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
"
5 6 Cartman "Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
"
5 6 Cartman "Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
"
5 6 Cartman "Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
"
5 6 Cartman "HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
"
5 6 Cartman "Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
"
5 6 Cartman "My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
"
5 6 Cartman "What?!
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
"
5 6 Cartman "No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
"
5 6 Cartman "Gentlemen, I thank you.
"
5 6 Cartman "Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa!

"
5 6 Cartman "Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
"
5 6 Cartman "Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
"
5 6 Cartman "What the hell?
"
5 6 Cartman "You sons of bitches! 
"
5 6 Cartman "What the hell are you doing?!
"
5 6 Cartman "That's right! You stay out!
"
5 6 Cartman "...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
"
5 6 Cartman "But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
"
5 6 Cartman "Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
"
5 6 Cartman "Ugh... Two people?
"
5 6 Cartman "Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
"
5 6 Cartman "Sweet.
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 
"
5 6 Cartman "I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
"
5 6 Cartman "The rest of you will just have to try another day.
"
5 6 Cartman "'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
"
5 6 Cartman "...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
"
5 6 Cartman "Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
"
5 6 Cartman "Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!
"
5 6 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I don't know how it works.
"
5 6 Cartman "Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
"
5 6 Cartman "Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 
"
5 6 Cartman "Wait a minute! Who are you?
"
5 6 Cartman "HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
"
5 6 Cartman "I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
"
5 6 Cartman "Get him out of here! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
"
5 6 Cartman "...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 
"
5 6 Cartman "AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!
"
5 6 Cartman "Hey, there you are! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Just give me my money back.
"
5 6 Cartman "I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
"
5 6 Cartman "You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
"
5 6 Cartman "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5 6 Cartman "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Yeah?
"
5 6 Cartman "He-hey, that's my money!
"
5 6 Cartman "What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
"
5 6 Cartman "Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
"
5 6 Cartman "No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
"
5 6 Cartman "But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
"
5 6 Cartman "This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
"
5 6 Cartman "It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 
"
5 6 Cartman "You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
"
5 6 Cartman "I'M SO PISSED OFF! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
"
5 6 Cartman "Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
"
5 6 Cartman "It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
"
5 7 Cartman "Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
"
5 7 Cartman "No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
"
5 7 Cartman "Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
"
5 7 Cartman "I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
"
5 7 Cartman "I told you guys.
"
5 7 Cartman "Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
"
5 7 Cartman "That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
"
5 7 Cartman "AIDS?
"
5 7 Cartman "Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
"
5 7 Cartman "Just put it on, Butters.
"
5 7 Cartman "Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
"
5 7 Cartman "I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
"
5 7 Cartman "Do you feel protected?
"
5 7 Cartman "Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
"
5 7 Cartman "I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
"
5 7 Cartman "So I don't get AIDS.
"
5 7 Cartman "I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
"
5 7 Cartman "Here, talk to them, Butters.
"
5 7 Cartman "Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
"
5 7 Cartman "Oh, bitch!
"
5 7 Cartman "Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
"
5 7 Cartman "Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
"
5 8 Cartman "Let a man take a crap!
"
5 8 Cartman "I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.

5 8 Cartman "Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
"
5 8 Cartman "Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Why?

5 8 Cartman "Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
"
5 8 Cartman "This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
"
5 8 Cartman "Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
"
5 8 Cartman "Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
"
5 8 Cartman "Bring it, bring it! 
"
5 8 Cartman "Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
"
5 8 Cartman "Date-rape psychosis.

5 8 Cartman "Awesome!

5 8 Cartman "We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
"
5 8 Cartman "Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!

5 8 Cartman "That's... so... cool!

5 8 Cartman "Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
"
5 8 Cartman "No! ...No!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey, towel!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
"
5 8 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
5 8 Cartman "No it isn't.
"
5 8 Cartman "Egh!
"
5 8 Cartman "This is where you came from?
"
5 8 Cartman "Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
"
5 8 Cartman "Alright, I think we go over there. 
"
5 8 Cartman "You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
"
5 8 Cartman "I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
"
5 8 Cartman "Yeah, and you're a towel!
"
5 8 Cartman "We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
"
5 8 Cartman "Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
"
5 8 Cartman "Could you turn it up?
"
5 8 Cartman "Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 
"
5 8 Cartman "Kenny!
"
5 8 Cartman "Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
"
5 8 Cartman "Hooray!
"
5 8 Cartman "You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
"
5 9 Cartman "...Not really.
"
5 9 Cartman "Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.

5 9 Cartman "Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
"
5 9 Cartman "God-damnit! 
"
5 9 Cartman "HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
"
5 9 Cartman "That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
"
5 9 Cartman "Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
"
5 9 Cartman "God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
"
5 9 Cartman "Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
"
5 9 Cartman "Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
"
5 9 Cartman "It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh no, not Towelie.
"
5 9 Cartman "No, we don't wanna get high!!
"
5 9 Cartman "That's right!
"
5 9 Cartman "Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
"
5 9 Cartman "Aw, son of a bitch!
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh ho, you guys.
"
5 9 Cartman "It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh, whatever!
"
5 9 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
"
5 9 Cartman "God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
"
5 9 Cartman "What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
"
5 9 Cartman "It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 
"
5 9 Cartman "What did you call us?!
"
5 9 Cartman "I told you! Jawas have no heart.
"
5 9 Cartman "You know, sand people.
"
5 9 Cartman "God, I hate you so much, Stan!
"
5 9 Cartman "Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
"
5 9 Cartman "Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
"
5 9 Cartman "Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
"
5 9 Cartman "I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
"
5 9 Cartman "He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
"
5 9 Cartman "Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh
"
5 9 Cartman "Uh oh! Mmm-mm! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Hey look! An infidel! 
"
5 9 Cartman "So that's what this is all about?
"
5 9 Cartman "Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
"
5 9 Cartman "Woohoo! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu. 
"
5 9 Cartman "There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 
"
5 9 Cartman "Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
"
5 9 Cartman "Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone. 
"
5 9 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
5 10 Cartman "You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!

5 10 Cartman "Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Yes it is! 
"
5 10 Cartman "...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
"
5 10 Cartman "Uh oh. 
"
5 10 Cartman "Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
"
5 10 Cartman "Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!

5 10 Cartman "YES! YES!
"
5 10 Cartman "Let me see! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
"
5 10 Cartman "Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
"
5 10 Cartman "I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
"
5 10 Cartman "Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
"
5 10 Cartman "Yes, I have it right hmya. 
"
5 10 Cartman "You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.

5 10 Cartman "Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye!

5 10 Cartman "Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
"
5 10 Cartman "No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
"
5 10 Cartman "No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh God.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh my... God. 
"
5 10 Cartman "You guys, something's wrong.
"
5 10 Cartman "I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
"
5 10 Cartman "It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
"
5 10 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
"
5 10 Cartman "Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
"
5 10 Cartman "You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
"
5 10 Cartman "Ugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Oh, dude, oh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
"
5 10 Cartman "Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 
"
5 10 Cartman "Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
"
5 10 Cartman "I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, let me have it.
"
5 10 Cartman "Okay, why?
"
5 10 Cartman "...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
"
5 10 Cartman "Who's there?
"
5 10 Cartman "Orange who?
"
5 10 Cartman "...naw, that didn't work either.
"
5 10 Cartman "Who's there?
"
5 10 Cartman "An interrupting cow who
"
5 10 Cartman "Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
"
5 10 Cartman "And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
"
5 10 Cartman "Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
"
5 10 Cartman "What's goin' on?
"
5 10 Cartman "Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
"
5 10 Cartman "Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
"
5 10 Cartman "A-heh, what?
"
5 10 Cartman "E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
"
5 10 Cartman "Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 
"
5 11 Cartman "What's that thing?
"
5 11 Cartman "What?
"
5 11 Cartman "Forty bucks?
"
5 11 Cartman "Alright, alright.
"
5 11 Cartman "Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
"
5 11 Cartman "Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
"
5 11 Cartman "...Oh, man.
"
5 11 Cartman "Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
"
5 11 Cartman "Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
"
5 11 Cartman "I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
"
5 11 Cartman "Ugh, ugh!
"
5 11 Cartman "Oh!
"
5 11 Cartman "Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
"
5 11 Cartman "Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
"
5 11 Cartman "Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
"
5 11 Cartman "No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
"
5 11 Cartman "Goddamnit, give me another chance!
"
5 11 Cartman "Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
"
5 11 Cartman "He's faaahn.
"
5 11 Cartman "1, 2, 3, 4...
"
5 11 Cartman "He's faaahn.
"
5 11 Cartman "Heheheheheh. 
"
5 11 Cartman "I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
"
5 11 Cartman "...Good job, Jew!
"
5 12 Cartman "Stand by, please.
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, god dammit!
"
5 12 Cartman "Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
"
5 12 Cartman "I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5 12 Cartman "Nothing! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Aw, that is such bullcrap!
"
5 12 Cartman "No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
"
5 12 Cartman "Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
"
5 12 Cartman "All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
"
5 12 Cartman "Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
"
5 12 Cartman "Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
"
5 12 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, dude. 
"
5 12 Cartman "What in the hell are they doing?
"
5 12 Cartman "Well, let's just play our game, then.
"
5 12 Cartman "Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Kick his nutsack! 
"
5 12 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
5 12 Cartman "Yeah.
"
5 12 Cartman "Hey.
"
5 12 Cartman "Ey, you did me already!
"
5 12 Cartman "Pussy. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
"
5 13 Cartman "Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Better.
"
5 13 Cartman "Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
"
5 13 Cartman "Mint condition, tax free.
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
"
5 13 Cartman "Stem cells, numbnuts!
"
5 13 Cartman "It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
"
5 13 Cartman "Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
"
5 13 Cartman "Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
"
5 13 Cartman "Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
"
5 13 Cartman "You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
"
5 13 Cartman "...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
"
5 13 Cartman "Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
"
5 13 Cartman "Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
"
5 13 Cartman "Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
"
5 13 Cartman "Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
"
5 13 Cartman "Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
"
5 13 Cartman "What is this, a PTA meeting? 
"
5 13 Cartman "In the ...hospital? Why?
"
5 13 Cartman "Die? Kenny?
"
5 13 Cartman "Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
"
5 13 Cartman "We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
"
5 13 Cartman "Heh, sorry. 
"
5 13 Cartman "...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
"
5 13 Cartman "Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
"
5 13 Cartman "' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
"
5 13 Cartman "I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
"
5 13 Cartman "Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
"
5 13 Cartman "Not at all, but go on. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My God...
"
5 13 Cartman "So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
"
5 13 Cartman "Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
"
5 13 Cartman "Hmmm.
"
5 13 Cartman "Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 
"
5 13 Cartman "There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
"
5 13 Cartman "My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
"
5 13 Cartman "And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
"
5 13 Cartman "Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
"
5 13 Cartman "Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
"
5 13 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
"
5 13 Cartman "Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
"
5 13 Cartman "You guys! Come quick! 
"
5 13 Cartman "It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 
"
5 13 Cartman "Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
"
5 13 Cartman "I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
"
5 13 Cartman "Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 
"
5 14 Cartman "Huho!
"
5 14 Cartman "We sure are.
"
