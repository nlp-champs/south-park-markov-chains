14 1 Kyle "Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
"
14 1 Kyle "Jesus, dude.
"
14 1 Kyle "I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
"
14 1 Kyle "What?!
"
14 1 Kyle "Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
"
14 1 Kyle "So what happens to us now?
"
14 1 Kyle "Oh God, it's true.
"
14 1 Kyle "Butters! Butters, stop it!
"
14 1 Kyle "Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
"
14 1 Kyle "No! Butters, stop! 
"
14 1 Kyle "Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
"
14 1 Kyle "Hello?
"
14 1 Kyle "Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
"
14 1 Kyle "Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
"
14 1 Kyle "Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
"
14 1 Kyle "Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
"
14 1 Kyle "...As soon as what's dead? 
"
14 1 Kyle "I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
"
14 1 Kyle "What?
"
14 1 Kyle "What bastard?
"
14 1 Kyle "I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
"
14 2 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
"
14 2 Kyle "No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
"
14 2 Kyle "I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
"
14 2 Kyle "Why the hell was this book banned?!
"
14 2 Kyle "Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
"
14 2 Kyle "Yeah, sweet.
"
14 2 Kyle "The Tale of... 
"
14 2 Kyle "Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
"
14 2 Kyle "Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
"
14 2 Kyle "What? 
"
14 2 Kyle "Yeah, we wrote that!
"
14 2 Kyle "No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
"
14 2 Kyle "Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
"
14 2 Kyle "Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
"
14 2 Kyle "The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
"
14 2 Kyle "Yes!
"
14 2 Kyle "I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
"
14 2 Kyle "What?! 
"
14 2 Kyle "Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
"
14 2 Kyle "Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
"
14 2 Kyle "Butters wrote a second book!
"
14 2 Kyle "We can get people to believe us now!
"
14 2 Kyle "A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
"
14 2 Kyle "Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"
14 3 Kyle "Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
"
14 3 Kyle "So where's the KFC now?
"
14 3 Kyle "...so no KFC?
"
14 4 Kyle "How the hell do you have more friends than me?
"
14 4 Kyle "How many friends do you have, Kenny?
"
14 4 Kyle "What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
"
14 4 Kyle "Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
"
14 4 Kyle "Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
"
14 4 Kyle "Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
"
14 4 Kyle "Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
"
14 4 Kyle "There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
"
14 4 Kyle "I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
"
14 4 Kyle "Can I come in?
"
14 4 Kyle "I... don't... have... any... friends...
"
14 4 Kyle "I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
"
14 4 Kyle "'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
"
14 4 Kyle "Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
"
14 4 Kyle "You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"
14 4 Kyle "'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
"
14 4 Kyle "Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
"
14 4 Kyle "I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
"
14 4 Kyle "I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
"
14 4 Kyle "I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
"
14 4 Kyle "No. What's chatroulette?
"
14 4 Kyle "Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
"
14 4 Kyle "Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
"
14 4 Kyle "That's just a guy's penis too!
"
14 4 Kyle "Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
"
14 4 Kyle "Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
"
14 4 Kyle "That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
"
14 4 Kyle "Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
"
14 4 Kyle "Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"
14 4 Kyle "Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
"
14 4 Kyle "...What?
"
14 4 Kyle "Dude, w-what are you doing?
"
14 4 Kyle "Profile status?
"
14 4 Kyle "Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
"
14 4 Kyle "Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
"
14 4 Kyle "Café World.
"
14 4 Kyle "An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
"
14 4 Kyle "Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
"
14 4 Kyle "What? Why?
"
14 4 Kyle "Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
"
14 4 Kyle "Unh, that does it!
"
14 4 Kyle "I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
"
14 5 Kyle "You should know, fatass.
"
14 5 Kyle "Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
"
14 5 Kyle "Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
"
14 5 Kyle "Dude, what did you do?
"
14 5 Kyle "Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
"
14 5 Kyle "Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
"
14 5 Kyle "K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
"
14 5 Kyle "Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 
"
14 5 Kyle "A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
"
14 5 Kyle "There doesn't have to be...
"
14 5 Kyle "But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
"
14 5 Kyle "What kind of extremists are these? 
"
14 5 Kyle "We can't give him over to the gingers!
"
14 6 Kyle "Aw crap.
"
14 6 Kyle "Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
14 6 Kyle "Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
"
14 6 Kyle "Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
"
14 6 Kyle "I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
"
14 6 Kyle "Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
"
14 6 Kyle "Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
"
14 6 Kyle "Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
"
14 6 Kyle "Oh, you are not doing that again!
"
14 6 Kyle "Stop talking with your stupid hand!
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude!
"
14 6 Kyle "We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
"
14 6 Kyle "Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"
14 6 Kyle "That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
"
14 6 Kyle "Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
"
14 6 Kyle "Wwait, what?
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
"
14 6 Kyle "You gotta be kidding me!
"
14 6 Kyle "Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
14 7 Kyle "If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
14 7 Kyle "When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
"
14 7 Kyle "Please, sir.
"
14 7 Kyle "Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
14 7 Kyle "If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"
14 7 Kyle "We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
14 7 Kyle "This is serious, you fucking asshole!
"
14 7 Kyle "But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
"
14 7 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
14 8 Kyle "Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
"
14 8 Kyle """What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?
"
14 8 Kyle "Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
"
14 8 Kyle "What?!
"
14 8 Kyle "Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
"
14 8 Kyle "How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"
14 8 Kyle "I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
"
14 9 Kyle "Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? 
"
14 9 Kyle "The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"".
"
14 9 Kyle "She said they're from New Jersey.
"
14 9 Kyle "Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
14 9 Kyle "Know what, Ma?
"
14 9 Kyle "Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
"
14 9 Kyle "Where the hell are they coming from?! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Hey, dudes.
"
14 9 Kyle "What are you talking about?
"
14 9 Kyle "So what?
"
14 9 Kyle "No, it doesn't!
"
14 9 Kyle "I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
"
14 9 Kyle "What's strike three?!
"
14 9 Kyle "Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
14 9 Kyle "Why does it matter?!
"
14 9 Kyle "No, it isn't!
"
14 9 Kyle "No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
"
14 9 Kyle "Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
"
14 9 Kyle "Not now, Mom. Please.
"
14 9 Kyle "All right, all right. 
"
14 9 Kyle "What am I, Mom?
"
14 9 Kyle "What are you saying?!
"
14 9 Kyle "No! I don't wanna look like this!
"
14 9 Kyle "I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"
14 9 Kyle "I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
"
14 9 Kyle "That's enough!
"
14 9 Kyle "Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Why?
"
14 9 Kyle "You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
14 9 Kyle "I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"
14 9 Kyle "All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
14 9 Kyle "No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
"
14 9 Kyle "Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
"
14 9 Kyle "Agggh! Agggh!  No! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
14 9 Kyle "You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
"
14 9 Kyle "It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
"
14 10 Kyle "What's it say?
"
14 10 Kyle "Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
14 10 Kyle "Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"
14 10 Kyle "But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
"
14 10 Kyle "How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
14 14 Kyle "Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
14 14 Kyle "We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
14 14 Kyle "He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
"
14 14 Kyle "He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"
14 14 Kyle "Let's hear it, Cartman!
"
14 14 Kyle "Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"
14 1 Kyle "Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
"
14 1 Kyle "Jesus, dude.

14 1 Kyle "No! Butters, stop! 
"
14 1 Kyle "Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
"
14 1 Kyle "Hello?

14 6 Kyle "Aw crap.
"
14 6 Kyle "Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
14 6 Kyle "Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
"
14 6 Kyle "Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
"
14 6 Kyle "I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
"
14 6 Kyle "Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
"
14 6 Kyle "Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
"
14 6 Kyle "Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
"
14 6 Kyle "Oh, you are not doing that again!
"
14 6 Kyle "Stop talking with your stupid hand!
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude!
"
14 6 Kyle "We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
"
14 6 Kyle "Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"
14 6 Kyle "That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
"
14 6 Kyle "Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
"
14 6 Kyle "Wwait, what?
"
14 6 Kyle "Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
"
14 6 Kyle "You gotta be kidding me!
"
14 6 Kyle "Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
14 7 Kyle "If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
14 7 Kyle "When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
"
14 7 Kyle "Please, sir.
"
14 7 Kyle "Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
14 7 Kyle "If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"
14 7 Kyle "We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
14 7 Kyle "This is serious, you fucking asshole!
"
14 7 Kyle "But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
"
14 7 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
14 8 Kyle "Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
"
14 8 Kyle """What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?
"
14 8 Kyle "Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
"
14 8 Kyle "What?!
"
14 8 Kyle "Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
"
14 8 Kyle "How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"
14 8 Kyle "I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
"
14 9 Kyle "Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? 
"
14 9 Kyle "The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"".
"
14 9 Kyle "She said they're from New Jersey.
"
14 9 Kyle "Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
14 9 Kyle "Know what, Ma?
"
14 9 Kyle "Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
"
14 9 Kyle "Where the hell are they coming from?! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Hey, dudes.
"
14 9 Kyle "What are you talking about?
"
14 9 Kyle "So what?
"
14 9 Kyle "No, it doesn't!
"
14 9 Kyle "I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
"
14 9 Kyle "What's strike three?!
"
14 9 Kyle "Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
14 9 Kyle "Why does it matter?!
"
14 9 Kyle "No, it isn't!
"
14 9 Kyle "No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
"
14 9 Kyle "Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
"
14 9 Kyle "Not now, Mom. Please.
"
14 9 Kyle "All right, all right. 
"
14 9 Kyle "What am I, Mom?
"
14 9 Kyle "What are you saying?!
"
14 9 Kyle "No! I don't wanna look like this!
"
14 9 Kyle "I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"
14 9 Kyle "I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
"
14 9 Kyle "That's enough!
"
14 9 Kyle "Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Why?
"
14 9 Kyle "You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
14 9 Kyle "I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"
14 9 Kyle "All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
14 9 Kyle "No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
"
14 9 Kyle "Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
"
14 9 Kyle "Agggh! Agggh!  No! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
14 9 Kyle "You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
"
14 9 Kyle "Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
"
14 9 Kyle "It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
"
14 10 Kyle "What's it say?
"
14 10 Kyle "Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
14 10 Kyle "Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"
14 10 Kyle "But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
"
14 10 Kyle "How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
14 14 Kyle "Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
14 14 Kyle "We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
14 14 Kyle "He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
"
14 14 Kyle "He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"
14 14 Kyle "Let's hear it, Cartman!
"
14 14 Kyle "Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"
