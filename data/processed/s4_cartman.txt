4 1 Cartman "Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
"
4 1 Cartman "There!

4 1 Cartman "Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.

4 1 Cartman "I'm sorry, Mom.
"
4 1 Cartman "I'm sorry, Token.
"
4 1 Cartman "Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
"
4 1 Cartman "No way!

4 1 Cartman "...What the hell is a hate crime?
"
4 1 Cartman "What? A federal offense?

4 1 Cartman "Oh no??

4 1 Cartman "Uh, yes?

4 1 Cartman "He's a black kid that goes to my school?
"
4 1 Cartman "He is black.
"
4 1 Cartman "I did?
"
4 1 Cartman "No! I hate hippies!
"
4 1 Cartman "I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
4 1 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
"
4 1 Cartman "No!
"
4 1 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
"
4 1 Cartman "They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
"
4 1 Cartman "Calm down, Kenny!
"
4 1 Cartman "Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, come on! I don't have much time!

4 1 Cartman "Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!

4 1 Cartman "We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit!

4 1 Cartman "Huh-who's Romper Stomper?

4 1 Cartman "Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
"
4 1 Cartman "Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
"
4 1 Cartman "Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
"
4 1 Cartman "I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!

4 1 Cartman "Well, okay... here... l'see...

4 1 Cartman "I want my Mo-omm 
"
4 1 Cartman "Mommy, I want my Mommy! 
"
4 1 Cartman "You will?
"
4 1 Cartman "What's the matter?
"
4 1 Cartman "Uhokay. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Oh. Really?
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
4 1 Cartman "Okay. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Oh. I can't take these. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Romper?
"
4 1 Cartman "You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
"
4 1 Cartman "You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
"
4 1 Cartman "O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
4 1 Cartman "You guys! 
"
4 1 Cartman "That's right! I'm back! 
"
4 1 Cartman "What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
"
4 1 Cartman "I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
4 1 Cartman "Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
"
4 1 Cartman "When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
"
4 1 Cartman "Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Sweet.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey, Romper Stomper.
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
"
4 1 Cartman "You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
"
4 1 Cartman "Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! This is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
"
4 2 Cartman "Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
"
4 2 Cartman "Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
"
4 2 Cartman "For one tooth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
"
4 2 Cartman "Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
"
4 2 Cartman "All we need is teeth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
4 2 Cartman "Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.
"
4 2 Cartman "How are we gonna get it from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
4 2 Cartman "Higher, you guys.
"
4 2 Cartman "Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
"
4 2 Cartman "I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 2 Cartman "Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
"
4 2 Cartman "Bull's eye!
"
4 2 Cartman "I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
"
4 2 Cartman "Okay.
"
4 2 Cartman "Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know, huh?
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
4 2 Cartman "Four dollars. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you what this means?
"
4 2 Cartman "Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!
"
4 2 Cartman "You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
"
4 2 Cartman "You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
"
4 2 Cartman "Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
"
4 2 Cartman "How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
"
4 2 Cartman "How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, Mother! No more lies! 
"
4 2 Cartman "There is no money.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know!
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
"
4 2 Cartman "But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle, open your eyes, man!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, man, that's just a TV show.
"
4 2 Cartman "What? That your parents lied to you, too?
"
4 2 Cartman "How?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Wow, look at the size of these houses!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Got it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "What the-? 
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
"
4 2 Cartman "It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
"
4 2 Cartman "We were there first!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, that is tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
"
4 2 Cartman "Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
"
4 2 Cartman "That's right. Keep the change, my man.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure, Kyle.
"
4 2 Cartman "So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
"
4 2 Cartman "How much?
"
4 2 Cartman "Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you think I'm an idiot?
"
4 2 Cartman "These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
"
4 2 Cartman "I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Will somebody take those books away from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
"
4 2 Cartman "I got it!
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle?
"
4 2 Cartman "Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
"
4 2 Cartman "...Tits.

"
4 3 Cartman "Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
"
4 3 Cartman "Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
"
4 3 Cartman "What's going on?
"
4 3 Cartman "No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
"
4 3 Cartman "But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!

4 3 Cartman "You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
"
4 3 Cartman "Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
"
4 3 Cartman "Hooray!
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
"
4 3 Cartman "Damn, we might be screwed.
"
4 3 Cartman "You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
"
4 3 Cartman "And shopping malls! Hooray! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Dude, what the hell happened?

4 4 Cartman "Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
"
4 4 Cartman "No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.

4 4 Cartman "It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
"
4 4 Cartman "Did you guys see that?

4 4 Cartman "What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
"
4 4 Cartman "There you go.

4 4 Cartman "Whah!

4 4 Cartman "I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.

4 6 Cartman "Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I just gave you AIDS.
"
4 6 Cartman "Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
"
4 6 Cartman "God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
4 6 Cartman "...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
"
4 6 Cartman "I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
"
4 6 Cartman "Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
4 6 Cartman "I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hi, are you Tony? 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yeah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
4 6 Cartman "Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell just happened?
"
4 6 Cartman "Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mister Hammerhead?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mr. Garrison??
"
4 6 Cartman "You wanna be my friend?
"
4 6 Cartman "That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
"
4 6 Cartman "Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
"
4 6 Cartman "No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
"
4 6 Cartman "Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
"
4 6 Cartman "YES I AM!! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
"
4 6 Cartman "You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
4 6 Cartman "Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "NAMBLA?
"
4 6 Cartman "Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
"
4 6 Cartman "Sure.
"
4 6 Cartman "...Sweet.
"
4 6 Cartman "Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Thanks, dude. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Really? Awesome!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
"
4 6 Cartman "KIIICK ASS!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
"
4 6 Cartman "We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "You can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
"
4 6 Cartman "Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
"
4 6 Cartman "They're all over the place.
"
4 6 Cartman "Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Now, are you a team player or not?!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
4 6 Cartman "Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, what?
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
"
4 7 Cartman "Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Not with me, man.
"
4 7 Cartman "He's fakin'! 
"
4 7 Cartman "But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"
4 7 Cartman """Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
"
4 7 Cartman "Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
"
4 7 Cartman "No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, mom.
"
4 7 Cartman "What's goin' on, guys?
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh-kay.
"
4 7 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
4 7 Cartman "Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
"
4 7 Cartman "I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
"
4 7 Cartman "Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
"
4 7 Cartman "What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
"
4 7 Cartman "No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
"
4 7 Cartman "Shut up, Fluffy! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
4 7 Cartman "whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
"
4 7 Cartman "Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
"
4 7 Cartman "I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
"
4 7 Cartman "It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
"
4 7 Cartman "You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
"
4 7 Cartman "No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
"
4 7 Cartman "I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
4 8 Cartman "Thaaat's ri-ight.
"
4 8 Cartman "Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes I do!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
4 8 Cartman "It's okay, I'm here.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
"
4 8 Cartman "That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
4 8 Cartman "The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
"
4 8 Cartman "Mmmm.
"
4 8 Cartman "You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
"
4 8 Cartman "Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
"
4 8 Cartman "I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"
4 8 Cartman "Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
4 8 Cartman "You won't let me help.
"
4 8 Cartman "…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
"
4 8 Cartman "I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 8 Cartman "Cool.
"
4 8 Cartman "Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""
"
4 8 Cartman "No way!
"
4 8 Cartman "Me neither. 
"
4 8 Cartman "Huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ahh! 
"
4 8 Cartman "Okay, It will be like this forever.
"
4 8 Cartman "Me, too!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
"
4 9 Cartman "My... girrrrrrrl... 
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
4 9 Cartman "That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
"
4 9 Cartman "Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
"
4 9 Cartman "So?
"
4 9 Cartman "What?
"
4 9 Cartman "Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
"
4 9 Cartman "Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
"
4 9 Cartman "We'll let you know, Butters.
"
4 9 Cartman "Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
"
4 9 Cartman "Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Kyle's brother?
"
4 9 Cartman "Christ's sake..!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next audition!
"
4 9 Cartman "Goddammit, NEXT!
"
4 9 Cartman "Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! 
"
4 9 Cartman "No way!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Dude, she's a chick!
"
4 9 Cartman """Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
4 9 Cartman "We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
"
4 9 Cartman "'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
"
4 9 Cartman "...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
"
4 9 Cartman "You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
"
4 9 Cartman "Since when?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
"
4 9 Cartman "I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?
"
4 9 Cartman "...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
4 9 Cartman "We're goin' to see the mall manager.
"
4 9 Cartman "But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, God, I can't see! 
"
4 9 Cartman "The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
"
4 9 Cartman "We... are Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
"
4 9 Cartman "Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
"
4 9 Cartman "--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, so can we play here?
"
4 9 Cartman "No??
"
4 9 Cartman "Why not?!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
"
4 9 Cartman "I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
"
4 9 Cartman "What's the Gomlich effect?
"
4 9 Cartman "So how do boy bands use that?
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?
"
4 9 Cartman "I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
"
4 9 Cartman "Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
"
4 9 Cartman "Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
"
4 9 Cartman "...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
4 9 Cartman "Roll camera!
"
4 9 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
4 9 Cartman "Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Hello again!
"
4 9 Cartman "I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
4 9 Cartman "If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Son of a bitch!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
"
4 9 Cartman "Really? You will?
"
4 9 Cartman "That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, Mom!
"
4 9 Cartman "Where the hell is Stan?!
"
4 9 Cartman "I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, god-damnit!
"
4 9 Cartman "God damnit! People are walking away! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Just another minute.
"
4 9 Cartman "Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
"
4 9 Cartman "We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
"
4 9 Cartman "No! He can't be dead!
"
4 9 Cartman "No! We were so close!
"
4 9 Cartman "But we have to perform!
"
4 9 Cartman "Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Ok-Okay, okay.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
"
4 9 Cartman "I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" 
"
4 10 Cartman """It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
4 10 Cartman "No no, no. Separation.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
4 10 Cartman "A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, what if we haven't?
"
4 10 Cartman "Jesus was made of crackers?
"
4 10 Cartman "So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
4 10 Cartman "Nno!
"
4 10 Cartman "But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, okay.
"
4 10 Cartman "Right, I already got that one.
"
4 10 Cartman "Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, you're already going to hell.
"
4 10 Cartman "You are, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
"
4 10 Cartman "What'd we do to Timmy?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
"
4 10 Cartman "How was it?
"
4 10 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 10 Cartman "Who's in there?
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, here goes everything. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
"
4 10 Cartman "And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
4 10 Cartman "Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
"
4 10 Cartman "I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
"
4 10 Cartman "Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
4 10 Cartman "What?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, now you've said it, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
"
4 10 Cartman "And he never took Communion!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Come on, hurry up! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
4 10 Cartman "I'm first, I'm first! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What the? 
"
4 10 Cartman "You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
"
4 10 Cartman "We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
"
4 10 Cartman "There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
"
4 10 Cartman "It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
"
4 11 Cartman "I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
"
4 11 Cartman "Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
"
4 11 Cartman "No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
"
4 11 Cartman "Oh my God!!
"
4 11 Cartman "It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
"
4 11 Cartman "Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
"
4 11 Cartman "Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
"
4 11 Cartman "He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
"
4 11 Cartman "Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister, have you read this book?
"
4 11 Cartman "Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
"
4 11 Cartman "We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Well...
"
4 11 Cartman "Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
4 11 Cartman "Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
"
4 11 Cartman "That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Devil be  gone-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Now walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "He walks-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Yes! Praise the Lord!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
"
4 11 Cartman "And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
"
4 11 Cartman "He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!""
"
4 11 Cartman "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
"
4 11 Cartman "Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
"
4 11 Cartman "Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
"
4 11 Cartman "It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
"
4 11 Cartman "Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
"
4 11 Cartman "My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
"
4 11 Cartman "Suck my balls!
"
4 11 Cartman "Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
"
4 11 Cartman "Uh-oh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
"
4 11 Cartman "Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
"
4 11 Cartman "You're gonna send me to hell?
"
4 11 Cartman "Aw, crap!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah,  get out of here! 
"
4 12 Cartman "There, that's better.
"
4 12 Cartman "U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
"
4 12 Cartman "Why, that's PERfect!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
"
4 12 Cartman "KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
"
4 12 Cartman "Oh, I'm sure I do.
"
4 12 Cartman "I'm trying.
"
4 12 Cartman "Fantastic, then.
"
4 12 Cartman "You guys are all such pussies!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
"
4 12 Cartman "Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
4 12 Cartman "I wish I was still there.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
"
4 12 Cartman "Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
"
4 12 Cartman "We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
"
4 12 Cartman "You're damn right they do!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
"
4 12 Cartman "Who the hell cares?!
"
4 12 Cartman "God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
"
4 12 Cartman "Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "There it is! Come on, everybody! 
"
4 12 Cartman "No way, lady!
"
4 12 Cartman "You can suck my balls!
"
4 12 Cartman "...What?
"
4 12 Cartman "Touché, teacher. Touché.
"
4 12 Cartman "What??
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
"
4 13 Cartman "He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
4 13 Cartman "Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, that's me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeahhh, you already know about it?
"
4 13 Cartman "Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""
"
4 13 Cartman "Here, Kyle. 
"
4 13 Cartman "And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
"
4 13 Cartman "Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
"
4 13 Cartman "And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
"
4 13 Cartman "Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
"
4 13 Cartman "Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Okay, that's cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ugh..! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 13 Cartman "You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
"
4 13 Cartman "It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
"
4 13 Cartman "Got ya! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
"
4 13 Cartman "Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
4 13 Cartman "You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
"
4 13 Cartman "What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
4 13 Cartman "Why the hell not?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
"
4 13 Cartman "But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "Whoa...
"
4 13 Cartman "Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
"
4 13 Cartman "Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
"
4 13 Cartman "Huh? 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
"
4 13 Cartman "What are you doing, Kyle?
"
4 13 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, screw you.
"
4 13 Cartman "Agh--! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
"
4 13 Cartman "Awww, man...
"
4 13 Cartman "Alright, alright.  Kyle...
"
4 14 Cartman "Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
"
4 14 Cartman "No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
"
4 14 Cartman "God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
"
4 14 Cartman "How good?
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
"
4 14 Cartman "That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
"
4 14 Cartman "This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
"
4 14 Cartman "Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
"
4 14 Cartman "And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
"
4 14 Cartman "Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
4 14 Cartman "You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""
"
4 14 Cartman "Cool! Can you get it for us?
"
4 14 Cartman "No no! 
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
"
4 14 Cartman "But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
"
4 14 Cartman "Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
4 14 Cartman "OP-pression!
"
4 14 Cartman "Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
"
4 14 Cartman "Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
"
4 14 Cartman "No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
"
4 14 Cartman "Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
"
4 14 Cartman "Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
"
4 14 Cartman "Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
"
4 14 Cartman "Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
"
4 14 Cartman "Like what?
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, that's not a bad idea.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, man!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
"
4 14 Cartman "Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright everybody, let's take our places!
"
4 14 Cartman "I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
"
4 14 Cartman "Union Mafia bastards! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
"
4 14 Cartman "Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
"
4 14 Cartman "...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
"
4 14 Cartman "What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
"
4 14 Cartman "They loved it! They LOVED it!
"
4 14 Cartman "That's it?
"
4 15 Cartman "I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
"
4 15 Cartman "Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
"
4 15 Cartman "God, I have to everything around here!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Fat camp?
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
"
4 15 Cartman "Don't touch me! 
"
4 15 Cartman "No.
"
4 15 Cartman "Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
"
4 15 Cartman "This... is... bullcrap!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
"
4 15 Cartman "Take it! I can't eat this crap!
"
4 15 Cartman "Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
"
4 15 Cartman "Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
"
4 15 Cartman "Hunh?  Uuh! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Memememeee! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
"
4 15 Cartman "Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
"
4 15 Cartman "Suck my balls, 20!
"
4 15 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
"
4 15 Cartman "Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
"
4 15 Cartman "Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
"
4 15 Cartman "...65, 66, 67... 
"
4 15 Cartman "Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
"
4 15 Cartman "You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, screw you, fatasses! 
"
4 16 Cartman "No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
"
4 16 Cartman "Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
"
4 16 Cartman "I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
"
4 16 Cartman "You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
4 16 Cartman "No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
"
4 16 Cartman "Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.
"
4 16 Cartman "Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
"
4 16 Cartman "You guys! Come out here! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Notice anything?  Watch. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
"
4 16 Cartman "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
"
4 16 Cartman "Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
"
4 16 Cartman "Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
"
4 16 Cartman "Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
"
4 16 Cartman "Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
"
4 16 Cartman "So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?
"
4 16 Cartman "Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Where is your husband?
"
4 16 Cartman "Seize her! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Outlander! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
"
4 16 Cartman "Butters, calm down, alright?
"
4 16 Cartman "I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Heh, heheh.
"
4 16 Cartman "We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
"
4 16 Cartman "The Provider awakes!
"
4 16 Cartman "Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
"
4 16 Cartman "Take him down. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Snow igloos kick ass. 
"
4 17 Cartman "Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
"
4 17 Cartman "Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
"
4 17 Cartman "Heh-tchoo!
"
4 17 Cartman "Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
"
4 17 Cartman "Family?
"
4 17 Cartman "My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
"
4 17 Cartman "Anything for more presents!
"
4 17 Cartman "Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
"
4 17 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
"
4 17 Cartman "Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
"

4 1 Cartman "I did?
"
4 1 Cartman "No! I hate hippies!
"
4 1 Cartman "I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
4 1 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
"
4 1 Cartman "No!
"
4 1 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
"
4 1 Cartman "They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!

4 1 Cartman "Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, come on! I don't have much time!

4 1 Cartman "Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
"
4 1 Cartman "Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
"
4 1 Cartman "Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.

4 1 Cartman "Mommy, I want my Mommy!

4 1 Cartman "You will?
"
4 1 Cartman "What's the matter?
"
4 1 Cartman "Uhokay.

4 1 Cartman "Oh. Really?

4 1 Cartman "Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
4 1 Cartman "Okay.

4 1 Cartman "Oh. I can't take these. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Romper?
"
4 1 Cartman "You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
"
4 1 Cartman "You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
"
4 1 Cartman "O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
4 1 Cartman "You guys! 
"
4 1 Cartman "That's right! I'm back! 
"
4 1 Cartman "What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
"
4 1 Cartman "I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
4 1 Cartman "Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
"
4 1 Cartman "When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
"
4 1 Cartman "Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Sweet.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey, Romper Stomper.
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
"
4 1 Cartman "You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
"
4 1 Cartman "Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! This is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
"
4 2 Cartman "Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
"
4 2 Cartman "Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
"
4 2 Cartman "For one tooth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
"
4 2 Cartman "Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
"
4 2 Cartman "All we need is teeth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
4 2 Cartman "Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.
"
4 2 Cartman "How are we gonna get it from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
4 2 Cartman "Higher, you guys.
"
4 2 Cartman "Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
"
4 2 Cartman "I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 2 Cartman "Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
"
4 2 Cartman "Bull's eye!
"
4 2 Cartman "I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
"
4 2 Cartman "Okay.
"
4 2 Cartman "Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know, huh?
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
4 2 Cartman "Four dollars. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you what this means?
"
4 2 Cartman "Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!
"
4 2 Cartman "You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
"
4 2 Cartman "You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
"
4 2 Cartman "Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
"
4 2 Cartman "How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
"
4 2 Cartman "How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, Mother! No more lies! 
"
4 2 Cartman "There is no money.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know!
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
"
4 2 Cartman "But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle, open your eyes, man!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, man, that's just a TV show.
"
4 2 Cartman "What? That your parents lied to you, too?
"
4 2 Cartman "How?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Wow, look at the size of these houses!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Got it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "What the-? 
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
"
4 2 Cartman "It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
"
4 2 Cartman "We were there first!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, that is tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
"
4 2 Cartman "Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
"
4 2 Cartman "That's right. Keep the change, my man.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure, Kyle.
"
4 2 Cartman "So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
"
4 2 Cartman "How much?
"
4 2 Cartman "Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you think I'm an idiot?
"
4 2 Cartman "These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
"
4 2 Cartman "I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Will somebody take those books away from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
"
4 2 Cartman "I got it!
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle?
"
4 2 Cartman "Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
"
4 2 Cartman "...Tits.
"
4 3 Cartman "He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow.

4 3 Cartman "Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides!

4 3 Cartman "Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
"
4 3 Cartman "Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
"
4 3 Cartman "Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
"
4 3 Cartman "What's going on?
"
4 3 Cartman "No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
"
4 3 Cartman "But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
"
4 3 Cartman "You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
"
4 3 Cartman "Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
"
4 3 Cartman "Hooray!
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
"
4 3 Cartman "Damn, we might be screwed.
"
4 3 Cartman "You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
"
4 3 Cartman "And shopping malls! Hooray! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Dude, what the hell happened?

"
4 4 Cartman "Phew!
"
4 4 Cartman "Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
"
4 4 Cartman "Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
"
4 4 Cartman "Yeah, me too.

4 4 Cartman "That was awesuhome!
"
4 4 Cartman "Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
"
4 4 Cartman "No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
"
4 4 Cartman "It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
"
4 4 Cartman "Did you guys see that?
"
4 4 Cartman "What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
"
4 4 Cartman "There you go. 
"
4 4 Cartman "Whah!
"
4 4 Cartman "I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
4 4 Cartman "So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny.

4 6 Cartman "Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
"
4 6 Cartman "It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
"
4 6 Cartman "Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I just gave you AIDS.
"
4 6 Cartman "Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
"
4 6 Cartman "God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
4 6 Cartman "...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
"
4 6 Cartman "I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
"
4 6 Cartman "Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
4 6 Cartman "I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hi, are you Tony? 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yeah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
4 6 Cartman "Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell just happened?
"
4 6 Cartman "Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mister Hammerhead?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mr. Garrison??
"
4 6 Cartman "You wanna be my friend?
"
4 6 Cartman "That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
"
4 6 Cartman "Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
"
4 6 Cartman "No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
"
4 6 Cartman "Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
"
4 6 Cartman "YES I AM!! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
"
4 6 Cartman "You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
4 6 Cartman "Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "NAMBLA?
"
4 6 Cartman "Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
"
4 6 Cartman "Sure.
"
4 6 Cartman "...Sweet.
"
4 6 Cartman "Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Thanks, dude. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Really? Awesome!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
"
4 6 Cartman "KIIICK ASS!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
"
4 6 Cartman "We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "You can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
"
4 6 Cartman "Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
"
4 6 Cartman "They're all over the place.
"
4 6 Cartman "Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Now, are you a team player or not?!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
4 6 Cartman "Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, what?
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
"
4 7 Cartman "Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Not with me, man.
"
4 7 Cartman "He's fakin'! 
"
4 7 Cartman "But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"
4 7 Cartman """Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
"
4 7 Cartman "Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
"
4 7 Cartman "No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, mom.
"
4 7 Cartman "What's goin' on, guys?
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh-kay.
"
4 7 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
4 7 Cartman "Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
"
4 7 Cartman "I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
"
4 7 Cartman "Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
"
4 7 Cartman "What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
"
4 7 Cartman "No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
"
4 7 Cartman "Shut up, Fluffy! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
4 7 Cartman "whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
"
4 7 Cartman "Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
"
4 7 Cartman "I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
"
4 7 Cartman "It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
"
4 7 Cartman "You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
"
4 7 Cartman "No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
"
4 7 Cartman "I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
4 8 Cartman "Thaaat's ri-ight.
"
4 8 Cartman "Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes I do!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
4 8 Cartman "It's okay, I'm here.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
"
4 8 Cartman "That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
4 8 Cartman "The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
"
4 8 Cartman "Mmmm.
"
4 8 Cartman "You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
"
4 8 Cartman "Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
"
4 8 Cartman "I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"
4 8 Cartman "Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
4 8 Cartman "You won't let me help.
"
4 8 Cartman "…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
"
4 8 Cartman "I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 8 Cartman "Cool.
"
4 8 Cartman "Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""
"
4 8 Cartman "No way!
"
4 8 Cartman "Me neither. 
"
4 8 Cartman "Huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ahh! 
"
4 8 Cartman "Okay, It will be like this forever.
"
4 8 Cartman "Me, too!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
"
4 9 Cartman "My... girrrrrrrl... 
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
4 9 Cartman "That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
"
4 9 Cartman "Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
"
4 9 Cartman "So?
"
4 9 Cartman "What?
"
4 9 Cartman "Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
"
4 9 Cartman "Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
"
4 9 Cartman "We'll let you know, Butters.
"
4 9 Cartman "Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
"
4 9 Cartman "Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Kyle's brother?
"
4 9 Cartman "Christ's sake..!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next audition!
"
4 9 Cartman "Goddammit, NEXT!
"
4 9 Cartman "Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! 
"
4 9 Cartman "No way!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Dude, she's a chick!
"
4 9 Cartman """Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
4 9 Cartman "We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
"
4 9 Cartman "'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
"
4 9 Cartman "...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
"
4 9 Cartman "You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
"
4 9 Cartman "Since when?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
"
4 9 Cartman "I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?
"
4 9 Cartman "...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
4 9 Cartman "We're goin' to see the mall manager.
"
4 9 Cartman "But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, God, I can't see! 
"
4 9 Cartman "The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
"
4 9 Cartman "We... are Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
"
4 9 Cartman "Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
"
4 9 Cartman "--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, so can we play here?
"
4 9 Cartman "No??
"
4 9 Cartman "Why not?!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
"
4 9 Cartman "I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
"
4 9 Cartman "What's the Gomlich effect?
"
4 9 Cartman "So how do boy bands use that?
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?
"
4 9 Cartman "I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
"
4 9 Cartman "Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
"
4 9 Cartman "Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
"
4 9 Cartman "...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
4 9 Cartman "Roll camera!
"
4 9 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
4 9 Cartman "Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Hello again!
"
4 9 Cartman "I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
4 9 Cartman "If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Son of a bitch!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
"
4 9 Cartman "Really? You will?
"
4 9 Cartman "That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, Mom!
"
4 9 Cartman "Where the hell is Stan?!
"
4 9 Cartman "I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, god-damnit!
"
4 9 Cartman "God damnit! People are walking away! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Just another minute.
"
4 9 Cartman "Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
"
4 9 Cartman "We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
"
4 9 Cartman "No! He can't be dead!
"
4 9 Cartman "No! We were so close!
"
4 9 Cartman "But we have to perform!
"
4 9 Cartman "Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Ok-Okay, okay.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
"
4 9 Cartman "I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" 
"
4 10 Cartman """It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
4 10 Cartman "No no, no. Separation.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
4 10 Cartman "A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, what if we haven't?
"
4 10 Cartman "Jesus was made of crackers?
"
4 10 Cartman "So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
4 10 Cartman "Nno!
"
4 10 Cartman "But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, okay.
"
4 10 Cartman "Right, I already got that one.
"
4 10 Cartman "Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, you're already going to hell.
"
4 10 Cartman "You are, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
"
4 10 Cartman "What'd we do to Timmy?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
"
4 10 Cartman "How was it?
"
4 10 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 10 Cartman "Who's in there?
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, here goes everything. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
"
4 10 Cartman "And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
4 10 Cartman "Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
"
4 10 Cartman "I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
"
4 10 Cartman "Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
4 10 Cartman "What?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, now you've said it, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
"
4 10 Cartman "And he never took Communion!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Come on, hurry up! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
4 10 Cartman "I'm first, I'm first! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What the? 
"
4 10 Cartman "You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
"
4 10 Cartman "We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
"
4 10 Cartman "There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
"
4 10 Cartman "It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
"
4 11 Cartman "I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
"
4 11 Cartman "Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
"
4 11 Cartman "No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
"
4 11 Cartman "Oh my God!!
"
4 11 Cartman "It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
"
4 11 Cartman "Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
"
4 11 Cartman "Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
"
4 11 Cartman "He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
"
4 11 Cartman "Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister, have you read this book?
"
4 11 Cartman "Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
"
4 11 Cartman "We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Well...
"
4 11 Cartman "Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
4 11 Cartman "Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
"
4 11 Cartman "That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Devil be  gone-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Now walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "He walks-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Yes! Praise the Lord!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
"
4 11 Cartman "And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
"
4 11 Cartman "He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!""
"
4 11 Cartman "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
"
4 11 Cartman "Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
"
4 11 Cartman "Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
"
4 11 Cartman "It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
"
4 11 Cartman "Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
"
4 11 Cartman "My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
"
4 11 Cartman "Suck my balls!
"
4 11 Cartman "Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
"
4 11 Cartman "Uh-oh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
"
4 11 Cartman "Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
"
4 11 Cartman "You're gonna send me to hell?
"
4 11 Cartman "Aw, crap!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah,  get out of here! 
"
4 12 Cartman "There, that's better.
"
4 12 Cartman "U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
"
4 12 Cartman "Why, that's PERfect!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
"
4 12 Cartman "KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
"
4 12 Cartman "Oh, I'm sure I do.
"
4 12 Cartman "I'm trying.
"
4 12 Cartman "Fantastic, then.
"
4 12 Cartman "You guys are all such pussies!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
"
4 12 Cartman "Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
4 12 Cartman "I wish I was still there.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
"
4 12 Cartman "Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
"
4 12 Cartman "We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
"
4 12 Cartman "You're damn right they do!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
"
4 12 Cartman "Who the hell cares?!
"
4 12 Cartman "God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
"
4 12 Cartman "Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "There it is! Come on, everybody! 
"
4 12 Cartman "No way, lady!
"
4 12 Cartman "You can suck my balls!
"
4 12 Cartman "...What?
"
4 12 Cartman "Touché, teacher. Touché.
"
4 12 Cartman "What??
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
"
4 13 Cartman "He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
4 13 Cartman "Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, that's me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeahhh, you already know about it?
"
4 13 Cartman "Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""
"
4 13 Cartman "Here, Kyle. 
"
4 13 Cartman "And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
"
4 13 Cartman "Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
"
4 13 Cartman "And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
"
4 13 Cartman "Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
"
4 13 Cartman "Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Okay, that's cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ugh..! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 13 Cartman "You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
"
4 13 Cartman "It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
"
4 13 Cartman "Got ya! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
"
4 13 Cartman "Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
4 13 Cartman "You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
"
4 13 Cartman "What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
4 13 Cartman "Why the hell not?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
"
4 13 Cartman "But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "Whoa...
"
4 13 Cartman "Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
"
4 13 Cartman "Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
"
4 13 Cartman "Huh? 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
"
4 13 Cartman "What are you doing, Kyle?
"
4 13 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, screw you.
"
4 13 Cartman "Agh--! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
"
4 13 Cartman "Awww, man...
"
4 13 Cartman "Alright, alright.  Kyle...
"
4 14 Cartman "Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
"
4 14 Cartman "No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
"
4 14 Cartman "God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
"
4 14 Cartman "How good?
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
"
4 14 Cartman "That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
"
4 14 Cartman "This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
"
4 14 Cartman "Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
"
4 14 Cartman "And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
"
4 14 Cartman "Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
4 14 Cartman "You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""
"
4 14 Cartman "Cool! Can you get it for us?
"
4 14 Cartman "No no! 
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
"
4 14 Cartman "But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
"
4 14 Cartman "Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
4 14 Cartman "OP-pression!
"
4 14 Cartman "Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
"
4 14 Cartman "Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
"
4 14 Cartman "No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
"
4 14 Cartman "Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
"
4 14 Cartman "Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
"
4 14 Cartman "Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
"
4 14 Cartman "Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
"
4 14 Cartman "Like what?
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, that's not a bad idea.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, man!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
"
4 14 Cartman "Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright everybody, let's take our places!
"
4 14 Cartman "I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
"
4 14 Cartman "Union Mafia bastards! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
"
4 14 Cartman "Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
"
4 14 Cartman "...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
"
4 14 Cartman "What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
"
4 14 Cartman "They loved it! They LOVED it!
"
4 14 Cartman "That's it?
"
4 15 Cartman "I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
"
4 15 Cartman "Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
"
4 15 Cartman "God, I have to everything around here!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Fat camp?
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
"
4 15 Cartman "Don't touch me! 
"
4 15 Cartman "No.
"
4 15 Cartman "Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
"
4 15 Cartman "This... is... bullcrap!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
"
4 15 Cartman "Take it! I can't eat this crap!
"
4 15 Cartman "Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
"
4 15 Cartman "Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
"
4 15 Cartman "Hunh?  Uuh! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Memememeee! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
"
4 15 Cartman "Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
"
4 15 Cartman "Suck my balls, 20!
"
4 15 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
"
4 15 Cartman "Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
"
4 15 Cartman "Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
"
4 15 Cartman "...65, 66, 67... 
"
4 15 Cartman "Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
"
4 15 Cartman "You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, screw you, fatasses! 
"
4 16 Cartman "No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
"
4 16 Cartman "Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
"
4 16 Cartman "I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
"
4 16 Cartman "You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
4 16 Cartman "No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
"
4 16 Cartman "Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.
"
4 16 Cartman "Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
"
4 16 Cartman "You guys! Come out here! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Notice anything?  Watch. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
"
4 16 Cartman "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
"
4 16 Cartman "Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
"
4 16 Cartman "Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
"
4 16 Cartman "Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
"
4 16 Cartman "Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
"
4 16 Cartman "So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?
"
4 16 Cartman "Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Where is your husband?
"
4 16 Cartman "Seize her! 
"

4 16 Cartman "I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
"
4 16 Cartman "Heh, heheh.

4 16 Cartman "Take him down. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Snow igloos kick ass. 
"
4 17 Cartman "Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
"
4 17 Cartman "Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
"
4 17 Cartman "Heh-tchoo!
"
4 17 Cartman "Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
"
4 17 Cartman "Family?

4 17 Cartman "Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
"
4 17 Cartman "Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.

4 17 Cartman "Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
"
4 17 Cartman "My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
"
4 17 Cartman "Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
"
4 17 Cartman "Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
"
4 17 Cartman "What?!
"
4 17 Cartman "I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!

4 1 Cartman "Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
"
4 1 Cartman "No way!

4 1 Cartman "...What the hell is a hate crime?
"
4 1 Cartman "What? A federal offense?

4 1 Cartman "Oh no??

4 1 Cartman "Uh, yes?

4 1 Cartman "He's a black kid that goes to my school?

4 1 Cartman "He is black.
"
4 1 Cartman "I did?
"
4 1 Cartman "No! I hate hippies!
"
4 1 Cartman "I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
4 1 Cartman "Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
"
4 1 Cartman "No!
"
4 1 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
"
4 1 Cartman "They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
"
4 1 Cartman "Calm down, Kenny!
"
4 1 Cartman "Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, come on! I don't have much time!

4 1 Cartman "We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit!

"
4 1 Cartman "Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
"
4 1 Cartman "Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
"
4 1 Cartman "Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
"
4 1 Cartman "I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, okay... here... l'see...

4 1 Cartman "I want my Mo-omm 
"
4 1 Cartman "Mommy, I want my Mommy! 
"
4 1 Cartman "You will?
"
4 1 Cartman "What's the matter?
"
4 1 Cartman "Uhokay. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Oh. Really?
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
4 1 Cartman "Okay. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Oh. I can't take these. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Romper?
"
4 1 Cartman "You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
"
4 1 Cartman "You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
"
4 1 Cartman "O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
4 1 Cartman "You guys! 
"
4 1 Cartman "That's right! I'm back! 
"
4 1 Cartman "What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
"
4 1 Cartman "I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
4 1 Cartman "Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
"
4 1 Cartman "When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey. 
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
"
4 1 Cartman "Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
4 1 Cartman "Sweet.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hey, Romper Stomper.
"
4 1 Cartman "Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
"
4 1 Cartman "You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
"
4 1 Cartman "Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
"
4 1 Cartman "Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
"
4 1 Cartman "Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! This is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
"
4 2 Cartman "Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
"
4 2 Cartman "Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
"
4 2 Cartman "For one tooth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
"
4 2 Cartman "Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
"
4 2 Cartman "All we need is teeth.
"
4 2 Cartman "Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
4 2 Cartman "Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.
"
4 2 Cartman "How are we gonna get it from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
4 2 Cartman "Higher, you guys.
"
4 2 Cartman "Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
"
4 2 Cartman "I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 2 Cartman "Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
"
4 2 Cartman "Bull's eye!
"
4 2 Cartman "I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
"
4 2 Cartman "Okay.
"
4 2 Cartman "Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know, huh?
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
4 2 Cartman "Four dollars. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you what this means?
"
4 2 Cartman "Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!
"
4 2 Cartman "You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
"
4 2 Cartman "You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
"
4 2 Cartman "Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
"
4 2 Cartman "How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
"
4 2 Cartman "How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, Mother! No more lies! 
"
4 2 Cartman "There is no money.
"
4 2 Cartman "I know!
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
"
4 2 Cartman "You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
"
4 2 Cartman "But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle, open your eyes, man!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
"
4 2 Cartman "No, man, that's just a TV show.
"
4 2 Cartman "What? That your parents lied to you, too?
"
4 2 Cartman "How?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Wow, look at the size of these houses!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
4 2 Cartman "Got it. 
"
4 2 Cartman "What the-? 
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
"
4 2 Cartman "It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
"
4 2 Cartman "We were there first!
"
4 2 Cartman "Man, that is tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
"
4 2 Cartman "Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
"
4 2 Cartman "That's right. Keep the change, my man.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
"
4 2 Cartman "Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
"
4 2 Cartman "Sure, Kyle.
"
4 2 Cartman "So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
"
4 2 Cartman "How much?
"
4 2 Cartman "Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
"
4 2 Cartman "Do you think I'm an idiot?
"
4 2 Cartman "These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
"
4 2 Cartman "I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
"
4 2 Cartman "Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
"
4 2 Cartman "Will somebody take those books away from him?
"
4 2 Cartman "Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
"
4 2 Cartman "Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
"
4 2 Cartman "I got it!
"
4 2 Cartman "Kyle?
"
4 2 Cartman "Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
"
4 2 Cartman "...Tits.
"
4 3 Cartman "He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow.

4 3 Cartman "Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides!

4 3 Cartman "Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
"
4 3 Cartman "Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
"
4 3 Cartman "Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
"
4 3 Cartman "What's going on?
"
4 3 Cartman "No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
"
4 3 Cartman "But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
"
4 3 Cartman "You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
"
4 3 Cartman "Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
"
4 3 Cartman "Hooray!
"
4 3 Cartman "Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
"
4 3 Cartman "Damn, we might be screwed.
"
4 3 Cartman "You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
"
4 3 Cartman "And shopping malls! Hooray! 
"
4 3 Cartman "Dude, what the hell happened?

"
4 4 Cartman "Phew!
"
4 4 Cartman "Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
"
4 4 Cartman "Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
"
4 4 Cartman "Yeah, me too.

4 4 Cartman "That was awesuhome!
"
4 4 Cartman "Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
"
4 4 Cartman "No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
"
4 4 Cartman "It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
"
4 4 Cartman "Did you guys see that?
"
4 4 Cartman "What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
"
4 4 Cartman "There you go. 
"
4 4 Cartman "Whah!
"
4 4 Cartman "I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
4 4 Cartman "So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny.

4 6 Cartman "Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
"
4 6 Cartman "It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
"
4 6 Cartman "Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I just gave you AIDS.
"
4 6 Cartman "Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
"
4 6 Cartman "God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
4 6 Cartman "...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
"
4 6 Cartman "I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
"
4 6 Cartman "Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
4 6 Cartman "I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hi, are you Tony? 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yeah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Wow, cool!
"
4 6 Cartman "Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell just happened?
"
4 6 Cartman "Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mister Hammerhead?
"
4 6 Cartman "Mr. Garrison??
"
4 6 Cartman "You wanna be my friend?
"
4 6 Cartman "That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
"
4 6 Cartman "Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
"
4 6 Cartman "No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
4 6 Cartman "I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
"
4 6 Cartman "Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
"
4 6 Cartman "YES I AM!! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
"
4 6 Cartman "You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
4 6 Cartman "Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
"
4 6 Cartman "NAMBLA?
"
4 6 Cartman "Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
"
4 6 Cartman "Sure.
"
4 6 Cartman "...Sweet.
"
4 6 Cartman "Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
"
4 6 Cartman "Thanks, dude. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Really? Awesome!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
"
4 6 Cartman "KIIICK ASS!
"
4 6 Cartman "Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
"
4 6 Cartman "We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "You can't go.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
"
4 6 Cartman "What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
"
4 6 Cartman "Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
"
4 6 Cartman "Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
"
4 6 Cartman "They're all over the place.
"
4 6 Cartman "Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
"
4 6 Cartman "Now, are you a team player or not?!
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
4 6 Cartman "Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
"
4 6 Cartman "Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
"
4 6 Cartman "Well, what?
"
4 6 Cartman "Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
"
4 6 Cartman "No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
"
4 7 Cartman "Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Not with me, man.
"
4 7 Cartman "He's fakin'! 
"
4 7 Cartman "But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"
4 7 Cartman """Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
"
4 7 Cartman "Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
"
4 7 Cartman "No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, mom.
"
4 7 Cartman "What's goin' on, guys?
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh-kay.
"
4 7 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
"
4 7 Cartman "No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
4 7 Cartman "Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
"
4 7 Cartman "I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
"
4 7 Cartman "Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
"
4 7 Cartman "What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
"
4 7 Cartman "No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
"
4 7 Cartman "Shut up, Fluffy! 
"
4 7 Cartman "Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
4 7 Cartman "whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
"
4 7 Cartman "Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
"
4 7 Cartman "I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
"
4 7 Cartman "Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
"
4 7 Cartman "It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
"
4 7 Cartman "You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
"
4 7 Cartman "No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
4 7 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
4 7 Cartman "Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
"
4 7 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 7 Cartman "Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
"
4 7 Cartman "I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
"
4 7 Cartman "Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
4 8 Cartman "Thaaat's ri-ight.
"
4 8 Cartman "Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes I do!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
4 8 Cartman "It's okay, I'm here.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
"
4 8 Cartman "That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
4 8 Cartman "The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
"
4 8 Cartman "Mmmm.
"
4 8 Cartman "You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
"
4 8 Cartman "Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
"
4 8 Cartman "I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"
4 8 Cartman "Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
4 8 Cartman "You won't let me help.
"
4 8 Cartman "…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
"
4 8 Cartman "I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah.
"
4 8 Cartman "Cool.
"
4 8 Cartman "Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""
"
4 8 Cartman "No way!
"
4 8 Cartman "Me neither. 
"
4 8 Cartman "Huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
"
4 8 Cartman "Ahh! 
"
4 8 Cartman "Okay, It will be like this forever.
"
4 8 Cartman "Me, too!
"
4 8 Cartman "Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
"
4 8 Cartman "Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
"
4 9 Cartman "My... girrrrrrrl... 
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "Boy band.
"
4 9 Cartman "There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
4 9 Cartman "That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
"
4 9 Cartman "Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
"
4 9 Cartman "So?
"
4 9 Cartman "What?
"
4 9 Cartman "Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
"
4 9 Cartman "Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
"
4 9 Cartman "We'll let you know, Butters.
"
4 9 Cartman "Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
"
4 9 Cartman "Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Kyle's brother?
"
4 9 Cartman "Christ's sake..!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next!
"
4 9 Cartman "Next audition!
"
4 9 Cartman "Goddammit, NEXT!
"
4 9 Cartman "Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! 
"
4 9 Cartman "No way!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Dude, she's a chick!
"
4 9 Cartman """Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
4 9 Cartman "We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
"
4 9 Cartman "'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
"
4 9 Cartman "...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
"
4 9 Cartman "You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
"
4 9 Cartman "Since when?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
"
4 9 Cartman "I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?
"
4 9 Cartman "...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
4 9 Cartman "We're goin' to see the mall manager.
"
4 9 Cartman "But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, God, I can't see! 
"
4 9 Cartman "The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
"
4 9 Cartman "We... are Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
"
4 9 Cartman "Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
4 9 Cartman "And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
"
4 9 Cartman "--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, so can we play here?
"
4 9 Cartman "No??
"
4 9 Cartman "Why not?!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
4 9 Cartman "Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
"
4 9 Cartman "I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
"
4 9 Cartman "What's the Gomlich effect?
"
4 9 Cartman "So how do boy bands use that?
"
4 9 Cartman "Thanks!
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?
"
4 9 Cartman "I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
"
4 9 Cartman "Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
"
4 9 Cartman "Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
"
4 9 Cartman "...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
4 9 Cartman "Roll camera!
"
4 9 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
4 9 Cartman "Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Hello again!
"
4 9 Cartman "I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
4 9 Cartman "If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
"
4 9 Cartman "Son of a bitch!
"
4 9 Cartman "You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
"
4 9 Cartman "Really? You will?
"
4 9 Cartman "That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, Mom!
"
4 9 Cartman "Where the hell is Stan?!
"
4 9 Cartman "I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
"
4 9 Cartman "Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
"
4 9 Cartman "Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, god-damnit!
"
4 9 Cartman "God damnit! People are walking away! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Just another minute.
"
4 9 Cartman "Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
"
4 9 Cartman "Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
"
4 9 Cartman "Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
"
4 9 Cartman "We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
"
4 9 Cartman "No! He can't be dead!
"
4 9 Cartman "No! We were so close!
"
4 9 Cartman "But we have to perform!
"
4 9 Cartman "Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
"
4 9 Cartman "Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
"
4 9 Cartman "Ok-Okay, okay.
"
4 9 Cartman "Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
"
4 9 Cartman "I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""
"
4 9 Cartman "Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" 
"
4 10 Cartman """It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
4 10 Cartman "No no, no. Separation.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
4 10 Cartman "A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, what if we haven't?
"
4 10 Cartman "Jesus was made of crackers?
"
4 10 Cartman "So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
4 10 Cartman "Nno!
"
4 10 Cartman "But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, okay.
"
4 10 Cartman "Right, I already got that one.
"
4 10 Cartman "Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, you're already going to hell.
"
4 10 Cartman "You are, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
"
4 10 Cartman "What'd we do to Timmy?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
"
4 10 Cartman "How was it?
"
4 10 Cartman "Huh?
"
4 10 Cartman "Who's in there?
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, here goes everything. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
"
4 10 Cartman "And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
4 10 Cartman "Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
"
4 10 Cartman "No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
4 10 Cartman "Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
"
4 10 Cartman "I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
"
4 10 Cartman "Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
"
4 10 Cartman "Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
4 10 Cartman "What?
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, now you've said it, too!
"
4 10 Cartman "Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
"
4 10 Cartman "Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
"
4 10 Cartman "And he never took Communion!
"
4 10 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
4 10 Cartman "Come on, hurry up! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
4 10 Cartman "I'm first, I'm first! 
"
4 10 Cartman "What the? 
"
4 10 Cartman "You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
"
4 10 Cartman "Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
4 10 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
"
4 10 Cartman "We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
"
4 10 Cartman "There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
"
4 10 Cartman "It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
"
4 11 Cartman "I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
"
4 11 Cartman "Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
"
4 11 Cartman "No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
"
4 11 Cartman "This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
"
4 11 Cartman "Oh my God!!
"
4 11 Cartman "It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
"
4 11 Cartman "Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
"
4 11 Cartman "Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
"
4 11 Cartman "He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
"
4 11 Cartman "Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister, have you read this book?
"
4 11 Cartman "Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
"
4 11 Cartman "We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Well...
"
4 11 Cartman "Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
4 11 Cartman "Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
"
4 11 Cartman "That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
4 11 Cartman "Praise the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
"
4 11 Cartman "We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Devil be  gone-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Now walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
"
4 11 Cartman "He walks-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "Yes! Praise the Lord!
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
"
4 11 Cartman "And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
"
4 11 Cartman "Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
"
4 11 Cartman "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
"
4 11 Cartman "He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
"
4 11 Cartman "Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!""
"
4 11 Cartman "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
"
4 11 Cartman "Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
"
4 11 Cartman "Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
"
4 11 Cartman "It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
"
4 11 Cartman "Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
"
4 11 Cartman "My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
"
4 11 Cartman "Suck my balls!
"
4 11 Cartman "Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
4 11 Cartman "Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
"
4 11 Cartman "Uh-oh.
"
4 11 Cartman "Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
"
4 11 Cartman "Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
"
4 11 Cartman "No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
"
4 11 Cartman "You're gonna send me to hell?
"
4 11 Cartman "Aw, crap!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah,  get out of here! 
"
4 12 Cartman "There, that's better.
"
4 12 Cartman "U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
"
4 12 Cartman "Why, that's PERfect!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
"
4 12 Cartman "KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
"
4 12 Cartman "Oh, I'm sure I do.
"
4 12 Cartman "I'm trying.
"
4 12 Cartman "Fantastic, then.
"
4 12 Cartman "You guys are all such pussies!
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
"
4 12 Cartman "Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
4 12 Cartman "I wish I was still there.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
"
4 12 Cartman "Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
"
4 12 Cartman "We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
4 12 Cartman "Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
"
4 12 Cartman "You're damn right they do!
"
4 12 Cartman "Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
"
4 12 Cartman "Who the hell cares?!
"
4 12 Cartman "God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
"
4 12 Cartman "Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
"
4 12 Cartman "Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
"
4 12 Cartman "There it is! Come on, everybody! 
"
4 12 Cartman "No way, lady!
"
4 12 Cartman "You can suck my balls!
"
4 12 Cartman "...What?
"
4 12 Cartman "Touché, teacher. Touché.
"
4 12 Cartman "What??
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
"
4 13 Cartman "He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
4 13 Cartman "Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, that's me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeahhh, you already know about it?
"
4 13 Cartman "Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""
"
4 13 Cartman "Here, Kyle. 
"
4 13 Cartman "And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
"
4 13 Cartman "Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
"
4 13 Cartman "And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
"
4 13 Cartman "Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hold it.
"
4 13 Cartman "I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
"
4 13 Cartman "Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
"
4 13 Cartman "Okay, that's cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ugh..! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ey!
"
4 13 Cartman "You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
"
4 13 Cartman "It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
"
4 13 Cartman "Got ya! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
"
4 13 Cartman "Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
4 13 Cartman "You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
"
4 13 Cartman "What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, dudes.
"
4 13 Cartman "Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
4 13 Cartman "Why the hell not?!
"
4 13 Cartman "Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
"
4 13 Cartman "But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
"
4 13 Cartman "Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, cool.
"
4 13 Cartman "Whoa...
"
4 13 Cartman "Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
"
4 13 Cartman "Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
"
4 13 Cartman "Huh? 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
"
4 13 Cartman "What are you doing, Kyle?
"
4 13 Cartman "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
"
4 13 Cartman "Hey, screw you.
"
4 13 Cartman "Agh--! 
"
4 13 Cartman "Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
"
4 13 Cartman "Awww, man...
"
4 13 Cartman "Alright, alright.  Kyle...
"
4 14 Cartman "Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
"
4 14 Cartman "No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
"
4 14 Cartman "God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
"
4 14 Cartman "How good?
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
"
4 14 Cartman "That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
"
4 14 Cartman "This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
"
4 14 Cartman "Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
"
4 14 Cartman "And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
"
4 14 Cartman "Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
4 14 Cartman "You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""
"
4 14 Cartman "Cool! Can you get it for us?
"
4 14 Cartman "No no! 
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
"
4 14 Cartman "But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
"
4 14 Cartman "Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
4 14 Cartman "OP-pression!
"
4 14 Cartman "Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
"
4 14 Cartman "Yeh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Whoa.
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
"
4 14 Cartman "Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
"
4 14 Cartman "No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
"
4 14 Cartman "Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
"
4 14 Cartman "I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
"
4 14 Cartman "I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
"
4 14 Cartman "Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
4 14 Cartman "Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
"
4 14 Cartman "Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
"
4 14 Cartman "Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
"
4 14 Cartman "Like what?
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, that's not a bad idea.
"
4 14 Cartman "Oh, man!
"
4 14 Cartman "No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
"
4 14 Cartman "Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
"
4 14 Cartman "Alright everybody, let's take our places!
"
4 14 Cartman "I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
4 14 Cartman "Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
"
4 14 Cartman "Union Mafia bastards! 
"
4 14 Cartman "Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
"
4 14 Cartman "Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
"
4 14 Cartman "...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
"
4 14 Cartman "What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
"
4 14 Cartman "Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
"
4 14 Cartman "They loved it! They LOVED it!
"
4 14 Cartman "That's it?
"
4 15 Cartman "I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
"
4 15 Cartman "Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
"
4 15 Cartman "God, I have to everything around here!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Fat camp?
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
"
4 15 Cartman "Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
"
4 15 Cartman "Don't touch me! 
"
4 15 Cartman "No.
"
4 15 Cartman "Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
"
4 15 Cartman "This... is... bullcrap!
"
4 15 Cartman "I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
"
4 15 Cartman "Take it! I can't eat this crap!
"
4 15 Cartman "Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
"
4 15 Cartman "Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
"
4 15 Cartman "You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
"
4 15 Cartman "Hunh?  Uuh! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Memememeee! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
"
4 15 Cartman "Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
"
4 15 Cartman "Suck my balls, 20!
"
4 15 Cartman "Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
"
4 15 Cartman "Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
"
4 15 Cartman "Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
"
4 15 Cartman "Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
"
4 15 Cartman "...65, 66, 67... 
"
4 15 Cartman "Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
"
4 15 Cartman "You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
"
4 15 Cartman "What?!
"
4 15 Cartman "Well, screw you, fatasses! 
"
4 16 Cartman "No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
"
4 16 Cartman "Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
"
4 16 Cartman "Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
"
4 16 Cartman "Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
"
4 16 Cartman "I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
"
4 16 Cartman "You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
4 16 Cartman "No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
"
4 16 Cartman "Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""
"
