13 1 Cartman "Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
13 1 Cartman "Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
13 1 Cartman "Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
13 1 Cartman "Butters, what's the problem?
"
13 1 Cartman "That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13 1 Cartman "Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
13 1 Cartman "He took it pretty well.
"
13 1 Cartman "The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
13 1 Cartman "Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
13 1 Cartman "Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
13 1 Cartman "Purity ring?
"
13 1 Cartman "Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
13 1 Cartman "Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
13 1 Cartman """Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
"
13 1 Cartman "Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
13 1 Cartman "This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
"
13 1 Cartman "The hell did you do to us?!
"
13 1 Cartman "I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
"
13 1 Cartman "And knowing is half the battle.
"
13 2 Cartman "The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
"
13 2 Cartman "Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
"
13 2 Cartman "I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
"
13 2 Cartman "You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
"
13 2 Cartman "He's not a fag!
"
13 2 Cartman "Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
"
13 2 Cartman "And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
13 2 Cartman "Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
13 2 Cartman "Hunh!
"
13 2 Cartman "I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
13 2 Cartman "I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
"
13 2 Cartman "Wha, what?
"
13 2 Cartman "What?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Fuckin' butthole!
"
13 2 Cartman "You gotta be kidding me!
"
13 2 Cartman "AAAAAHT!! 
"
13 2 Cartman "So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 
"
13 2 Cartman "Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
"
13 2 Cartman "What?! Why?
"
13 2 Cartman "It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Fucking bitch...
"
13 2 Cartman "Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
"
13 3 Cartman "And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
"
13 3 Cartman "Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
13 3 Cartman "Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
"
13 3 Cartman "The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
"
13 3 Cartman "Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
"
13 3 Cartman "I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
"
13 3 Cartman "Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
13 3 Cartman "All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
"
13 4 Cartman "Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
"
13 4 Cartman "Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
"
13 4 Cartman "No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
"
13 4 Cartman "Let's get to my house!! 
"
13 4 Cartman "Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
13 4 Cartman "It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
"
13 4 Cartman "What?
"
13 4 Cartman "What the fuck is this?!
"
13 4 Cartman "Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
13 4 Cartman "No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
13 4 Cartman "You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
"
13 4 Cartman "Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
"
13 4 Cartman "You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
"
13 4 Cartman "And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
"
13 4 Cartman "Yes, that's good.
"
13 4 Cartman "Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
"
13 4 Cartman "We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
"
13 4 Cartman "You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
"
13 4 Cartman "Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
"
13 4 Cartman "Sick! Stop it, lady!
"
13 4 Cartman "It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
13 5 Cartman "No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
"
13 5 Cartman "No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Meh. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
13 5 Cartman "What, dude, you got something?
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah.
"
13 5 Cartman "Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
"
13 5 Cartman "Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
"
13 5 Cartman "Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
"
13 5 Cartman "Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
13 5 Cartman "Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
"
13 5 Cartman "Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you?
"
13 5 Cartman "And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
"
13 5 Cartman "Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
13 5 Cartman "Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Motherfucker!
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
13 5 Cartman "But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
"
13 5 Cartman "What?!
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
"
13 5 Cartman "Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
"
13 5 Cartman "Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
"
13 5 Cartman "It's cool man, it's cool. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
"
13 5 Cartman "It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
13 5 Cartman "You do?
"
13 5 Cartman "But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
"
13 5 Cartman "That's cool. You wanna write some together? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
13 5 Cartman "So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""
"
13 5 Cartman "It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Thanks you guys!
"
13 5 Cartman "Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
"
13 5 Cartman "Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
13 5 Cartman "Uhhh excuse me? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
13 5 Cartman "Whassat?
"
13 5 Cartman "So... here it is.
"
13 5 Cartman "That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
"
13 5 Cartman "Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
"
13 5 Cartman "Hello Jim.
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you up to?
"
13 5 Cartman "Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
"
13 5 Cartman "Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" 
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
"
13 5 Cartman "You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
"
13 5 Cartman "All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
"
13 5 Cartman "I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
"
13 7 Cartman "You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
13 7 Cartman "Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
"
13 7 Cartman "North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
"
13 7 Cartman "I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
"
13 7 Cartman "Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
"
13 7 Cartman "Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
"
13 7 Cartman "Then why don't you wanna go?
"
13 7 Cartman "That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning!

13 7 Cartman "Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?

13 7 Cartman "Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?

13 7 Cartman "But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.

13 7 Cartman "You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
"
13 7 Cartman "Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
"
13 7 Cartman "Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
"
13 7 Cartman "The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.
"
13 7 Cartman "Ah, nice. Come on, mateys!

13 7 Cartman "Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you.

13 7 Cartman "Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
"
13 7 Cartman "I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"
13 7 Cartman "Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
"
13 7 Cartman "Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"
13 7 Cartman "This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!

13 7 Cartman "Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.

13 7 Cartman "Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!

13 7 Cartman "Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!

13 7 Cartman "The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!

13 7 Cartman "Alright, let's go!

I mean, I mean look, look at this guy!  Look at this guy for Christ's sake!  I mean, how hard is this, people?!   I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!

13 7 Cartman "Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
"
13 7 Cartman "Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
"
13 7 Cartman """It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome.""
"
13 7 Cartman "Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
"
13 7 Cartman "Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.

13 7 Cartman "Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!

13 7 Cartman "Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!

13 7 Cartman "Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever!

13 8 Cartman "HA! What a dumbass!

13 8 Cartman "Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
"
13 8 Cartman "Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
"
13 8 Cartman "The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
"
13 8 Cartman "That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
"
13 8 Cartman "Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
"
13 8 Cartman "Because he was a great person, Kyle.
"
13 8 Cartman "...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
"
13 8 Cartman "Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
"
13 8 Cartman "Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
"
13 8 Cartman "Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...

13 8 Cartman "Billy Mays!  It's him!
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
"
13 8 Cartman "Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
"
13 8 Cartman "Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
"
13 8 Cartman "Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes!
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
"
13 8 Cartman "A child... and a female. And white.
"
13 8 Cartman "Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
"
13 8 Cartman "God I hope this works.
"
13 8 Cartman "Hey, what the F?!
"
13 8 Cartman "Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
"
13 8 Cartman "So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
"
13 8 Cartman "Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
"
13 8 Cartman "What if you didn't have to give it up?
"
13 8 Cartman "I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
"
13 8 Cartman "Yeah!
"
13 8 Cartman "Good job Ike! 
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
"
13 9 Cartman "Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" 
"
13 9 Cartman "Alright, your turn Craig.
"
13 9 Cartman "Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
"
13 9 Cartman "Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
"
13 9 Cartman "Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"
13 9 Cartman "Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
"
13 9 Cartman "Atta boy Butters!
"
13 9 Cartman "Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
"
13 9 Cartman "Dude, we've created a monster.
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh, sweet! 
"
13 10 Cartman "This is awesome!
"
13 10 Cartman "Dude! That was so badass!
"
13 10 Cartman "The fuck is this?!
"
13 10 Cartman "I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
"
13 10 Cartman "All right!
"
13 10 Cartman "The Rad Russian.
"
13 10 Cartman "You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
13 10 Cartman "Huh?
"
13 10 Cartman "Okay...
"
13 10 Cartman "The fuck is this?!
"
13 10 Cartman "Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
"
13 10 Cartman "That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
13 10 Cartman "Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
13 10 Cartman "The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.
"
13 10 Cartman "Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
13 10 Cartman "Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
"
13 10 Cartman "You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
"
13 10 Cartman "Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
"
13 10 Cartman "Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
"
13 10 Cartman "And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
13 10 Cartman "I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
13 10 Cartman "Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
"
13 10 Cartman "It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
"
13 10 Cartman "Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
"
13 10 Cartman "I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
"
13 10 Cartman "You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
"
13 10 Cartman "We just received a letter from the WWE.
"
13 10 Cartman """Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
13 10 Cartman "Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
"
13 10 Cartman "Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
"
13 10 Cartman "Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
"
13 10 Cartman "And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
"
13 10 Cartman "Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
"
13 10 Cartman "Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
13 10 Cartman "Right?
"
13 10 Cartman "No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
"
13 10 Cartman "Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
"
13 10 Cartman "Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
13 10 Cartman "It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
"
13 10 Cartman "Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
"
13 10 Cartman "Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
13 10 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
13 10 Cartman "Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
13 10 Cartman "Yeah, this guy crushes.
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright, places everyone.
"
13 10 Cartman "Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
"
13 10 Cartman "My man can do whatever he wants.
"
13 10 Cartman "You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
13 10 Cartman "My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
"
13 10 Cartman "Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
"
13 10 Cartman "You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
"
13 10 Cartman "O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
"
13 10 Cartman "Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
"
13 10 Cartman "Hey, what about us? Our show? 
"
13 10 Cartman "This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
"
13 10 Cartman "Kenny! I'm-
"
13 11 Cartman "Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
13 11 Cartman "What do you mean? This song is sweet.
"
13 11 Cartman "I'm not too busy, Stan.
"
13 11 Cartman "No, I just don't care. At all.
"
13 11 Cartman "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
"
13 11 Cartman "I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
"
13 11 Cartman "Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
"
13 11 Cartman "What dude?
"
13 11 Cartman "We always have.
"
13 11 Cartman "That's not what we said.
"
13 11 Cartman "We were talking about Wales the country.
"
13 11 Cartman "Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
"
13 11 Cartman "All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
"
13 11 Cartman "Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
"
13 11 Cartman "Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
"
13 11 Cartman "Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
"
13 11 Cartman "Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
"
13 11 Cartman "Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
"
13 11 Cartman "Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
"
13 11 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
"
13 11 Cartman "You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
"
13 11 Cartman "Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
"
13 11 Cartman "What dude?
"
13 11 Cartman "Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
"
13 11 Cartman "So that's what this has all been about?
"
13 11 Cartman "Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
"
13 12 Cartman "Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
"
13 12 Cartman "God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
"
13 12 Cartman "Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
"
13 12 Cartman "Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
"
13 12 Cartman "You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
"
13 12 Cartman "No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
"
13 12 Cartman "But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
13 12 Cartman "Agreed.
"
13 12 Cartman "Ni-nice, okay.
"
13 12 Cartman "What?
"
13 12 Cartman "I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
"
13 12 Cartman "Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
"
13 12 Cartman "I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
"
13 12 Cartman "That was us!
"
13 12 Cartman "Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
"
13 12 Cartman "Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
"
13 12 Cartman "You call them ""bike-curious"".
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
"
13 12 Cartman "Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
13 12 Cartman "Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
"
13 12 Cartman "No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh. My. Goodddd.
"
13 13 Cartman "Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
"
13 13 Cartman "He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
"
13 13 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
"
13 13 Cartman "Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
"
13 13 Cartman "Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
"
13 13 Cartman "But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
"
13 13 Cartman "You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
13 13 Cartman "Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
13 13 Cartman "You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
"
13 13 Cartman "Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
"
13 13 Cartman "- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"
13 13 Cartman "Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
"
13 13 Cartman "Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
"
13 13 Cartman "I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
"
13 13 Cartman """Thank you"" and this is to..?
"
13 13 Cartman """To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
"
13 13 Cartman "Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
"
13 13 Cartman "Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
"
13 13 Cartman "That'll be five dollars.
"
13 13 Cartman "A book signing.
"
13 13 Cartman "I do not directly say she's a slut!
"
13 13 Cartman "You didn't read the rest, dude.
"
13 13 Cartman """Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
"
13 13 Cartman "You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
"
13 13 Cartman "And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
"
13 13 Cartman "Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
"
13 13 Cartman "Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
"
13 13 Cartman "The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"
13 13 Cartman "Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
"
13 13 Cartman "And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
"
13 13 Cartman "Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
"
13 13 Cartman "People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
"
13 13 Cartman "Of course. That's why we're here.
"
13 13 Cartman "Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
"
13 13 Cartman "Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
"
13 13 Cartman "How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
"
13 13 Cartman "You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
"
13 13 Cartman "Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
"
13 13 Cartman "If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
"
13 13 Cartman "You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
"
13 13 Cartman "Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
"
13 13 Cartman "What? What do you mean I know that?
"
13 13 Cartman "No! You wiped them all out!
"
13 13 Cartman "Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
"
13 13 Cartman "Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
"
13 13 Cartman "No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
"
13 13 Cartman "You sold the movie rights to who?!
"
13 13 Cartman "Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Huh!
"
13 13 Cartman "No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
"
13 13 Cartman "I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
"
13 13 Cartman "I'm doin' the best I can! 
"
13 14 Cartman "We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
"
13 14 Cartman "This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
"
13 14 Cartman "No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
13 14 Cartman "You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
"
13 14 Cartman "Come on, let's go!
"
13 14 Cartman "Six adorable children please.
"
13 14 Cartman "Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13 14 Cartman "Forget it! Just forget it! 
"
13 14 Cartman "What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
"
13 14 Cartman "Just do it in English!
"
13 14 Cartman "There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
"
13 14 Cartman "You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
"
13 14 Cartman "I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
13 14 Cartman "So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
"
13 14 Cartman "...What do you mean?
"
13 14 Cartman "The black and brown people.
"
13 14 Cartman "Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
"
13 14 Cartman "Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
"
13 14 Cartman "The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
13 14 Cartman "You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
"
13 14 Cartman "Help! Help!
"
13 14 Cartman "Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
"
13 14 Cartman "Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
13 14 Cartman "Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
"
13 14 Cartman "It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
"
13 14 Cartman "I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
13 14 Cartman "...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
"
13 14 Cartman "Well, I do just as much work.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...
"
13 14 Cartman "NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
"
13 14 Cartman "Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
"
13 14 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
"
13 14 Cartman "It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
"
13 1 Cartman "Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
13 1 Cartman "Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
13 1 Cartman "Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
13 1 Cartman "Butters, what's the problem?
"
13 1 Cartman "That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13 1 Cartman "Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
13 1 Cartman "He took it pretty well.
"
13 1 Cartman "The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
13 1 Cartman "Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
13 1 Cartman "Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
13 1 Cartman "Purity ring?
"
13 1 Cartman "Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
13 1 Cartman "Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
13 1 Cartman "Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
13 1 Cartman """Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
"
13 1 Cartman "Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
13 1 Cartman "This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
"
13 1 Cartman "The hell did you do to us?!
"
13 1 Cartman "I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
"
13 1 Cartman "And knowing is half the battle.
"
13 2 Cartman "The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
"
13 2 Cartman "Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
"
13 2 Cartman "I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
"
13 2 Cartman "You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
"
13 2 Cartman "He's not a fag!
"
13 2 Cartman "Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
"
13 2 Cartman "And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
13 2 Cartman "Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
13 2 Cartman "Hunh!
"
13 2 Cartman "I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
13 2 Cartman "I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
"
13 2 Cartman "Wha, what?
"
13 2 Cartman "What?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Fuckin' butthole!
"
13 2 Cartman "You gotta be kidding me!
"
13 2 Cartman "AAAAAHT!! 
"
13 2 Cartman "So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 
"
13 2 Cartman "Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
"
13 2 Cartman "What?! Why?
"
13 2 Cartman "It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
"
13 2 Cartman "Fucking bitch...
"
13 2 Cartman "Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
"
13 3 Cartman "And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
"
13 3 Cartman "Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
13 3 Cartman "Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
"
13 3 Cartman "The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
"
13 3 Cartman "Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
"
13 3 Cartman "I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
"
13 3 Cartman "Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
13 3 Cartman "All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
"
13 4 Cartman "Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
"
13 4 Cartman "Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
"
13 4 Cartman "No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
"
13 4 Cartman "Let's get to my house!! 
"
13 4 Cartman "Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
13 4 Cartman "It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
"
13 4 Cartman "What?
"
13 4 Cartman "What the fuck is this?!
"
13 4 Cartman "Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
13 4 Cartman "No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
13 4 Cartman "You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
"
13 4 Cartman "Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
"
13 4 Cartman "You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
"
13 4 Cartman "And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
"
13 4 Cartman "Yes, that's good.
"
13 4 Cartman "Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
"
13 4 Cartman "We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
"
13 4 Cartman "You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
"
13 4 Cartman "Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
"
13 4 Cartman "Sick! Stop it, lady!
"
13 4 Cartman "It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
13 5 Cartman "No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
"
13 5 Cartman "No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Meh. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
13 5 Cartman "What, dude, you got something?
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah.
"
13 5 Cartman "Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
"
13 5 Cartman "Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
"
13 5 Cartman "Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
"
13 5 Cartman "Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
13 5 Cartman "Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
"
13 5 Cartman "Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you?
"
13 5 Cartman "And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
"
13 5 Cartman "Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
13 5 Cartman "Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Motherfucker!
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
13 5 Cartman "But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
"
13 5 Cartman "What?!
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
"
13 5 Cartman "Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
"
13 5 Cartman "Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
"
13 5 Cartman "It's cool man, it's cool. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
"
13 5 Cartman "It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
13 5 Cartman "You do?
"
13 5 Cartman "But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
"
13 5 Cartman "Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
"
13 5 Cartman "That's cool. You wanna write some together? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
13 5 Cartman "So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""
"
13 5 Cartman "It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Thanks you guys!
"
13 5 Cartman "Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
"
13 5 Cartman "Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
13 5 Cartman "Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
13 5 Cartman "Uhhh excuse me? 
"
13 5 Cartman "Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
"
13 5 Cartman "Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
13 5 Cartman "Whassat?
"
13 5 Cartman "So... here it is.
"
13 5 Cartman "That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
"
13 5 Cartman "Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
"
13 5 Cartman "Hello Jim.
"
13 5 Cartman "What are you up to?
"
13 5 Cartman "Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
"
13 5 Cartman "Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
"
13 5 Cartman "Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" 
"
13 5 Cartman "Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! 
"
13 5 Cartman "Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
"
13 5 Cartman "You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
"
13 5 Cartman "Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
"
13 5 Cartman "All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
"
13 5 Cartman "I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
"
13 7 Cartman "You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
13 7 Cartman "Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
"
13 7 Cartman "North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
"
13 7 Cartman "I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
"
13 7 Cartman "Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
"
13 7 Cartman "Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
"
13 7 Cartman "Then why don't you wanna go?
"

13 7 Cartman "Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
"
13 7 Cartman "Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.

13 8 Cartman "The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
"
13 8 Cartman "That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
"
13 8 Cartman "Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
"
13 8 Cartman "Because he was a great person, Kyle.
"
13 8 Cartman "...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...

13 8 Cartman "Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
"
13 8 Cartman "Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.

13 8 Cartman "Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes!
"
13 8 Cartman "Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole!

13 8 Cartman "A child... and a female. And white.

"
13 8 Cartman "Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
"
13 8 Cartman "What if you didn't have to give it up?

13 8 Cartman "I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.

"
13 9 Cartman "Alright, your turn Craig.
"
13 9 Cartman "Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
"
13 9 Cartman "Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
"
13 9 Cartman "Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"
13 9 Cartman "Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
"
13 9 Cartman "Atta boy Butters!
"
13 9 Cartman "Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
"
13 9 Cartman "Dude, we've created a monster.
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh, sweet! 
"
13 10 Cartman "This is awesome!
"
13 10 Cartman "Dude! That was so badass!
"
13 10 Cartman "The fuck is this?!
"
13 10 Cartman "I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
"
13 10 Cartman "All right!
"
13 10 Cartman "The Rad Russian.
"
13 10 Cartman "You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
13 10 Cartman "Huh?
"
13 10 Cartman "Okay...
"
13 10 Cartman "The fuck is this?!
"
13 10 Cartman "Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
"
13 10 Cartman "That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
13 10 Cartman "Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
13 10 Cartman "The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.
"
13 10 Cartman "Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
13 10 Cartman "Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
"
13 10 Cartman "You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
"
13 10 Cartman "Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
"
13 10 Cartman "Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
"
13 10 Cartman "And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
13 10 Cartman "I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
13 10 Cartman "Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
"
13 10 Cartman "It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
"
13 10 Cartman "Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
"
13 10 Cartman "I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
"
13 10 Cartman "You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
"
13 10 Cartman "We just received a letter from the WWE.
"
13 10 Cartman """Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
13 10 Cartman "Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
"
13 10 Cartman "Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
"
13 10 Cartman "Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
"
13 10 Cartman "And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
"
13 10 Cartman "Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
"
13 10 Cartman "Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
13 10 Cartman "Right?
"
13 10 Cartman "No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
"
13 10 Cartman "Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
"
13 10 Cartman "Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
13 10 Cartman "It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
"
13 10 Cartman "Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
"
13 10 Cartman "Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
13 10 Cartman "Thank you. 
"
13 10 Cartman "Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
13 10 Cartman "Yeah, this guy crushes.
"
13 10 Cartman "Alright, places everyone.
"
13 10 Cartman "Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
"
13 10 Cartman "My man can do whatever he wants.
"
13 10 Cartman "You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
13 10 Cartman "My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
"
13 10 Cartman "Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
"
13 10 Cartman "You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
"
13 10 Cartman "O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
"
13 10 Cartman "Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
"
13 10 Cartman "Hey, what about us? Our show? 
"
13 10 Cartman "This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
"
13 10 Cartman "Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
"
13 10 Cartman "Kenny! I'm-
"
13 11 Cartman "Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
13 11 Cartman "What do you mean? This song is sweet.
"
13 11 Cartman "I'm not too busy, Stan.
"
13 11 Cartman "No, I just don't care. At all.
"
13 11 Cartman "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
"
13 11 Cartman "I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
"
13 11 Cartman "Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
"
13 11 Cartman "What dude?
"
13 11 Cartman "We always have.
"
13 11 Cartman "That's not what we said.
"
13 11 Cartman "We were talking about Wales the country.
"
13 11 Cartman "Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
"
13 11 Cartman "All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
"
13 11 Cartman "Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
"
13 11 Cartman "Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
"
13 11 Cartman "Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
"
13 11 Cartman "Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
"
13 11 Cartman "Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
"
13 11 Cartman "Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
"
13 11 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
"
13 11 Cartman "You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
"
13 11 Cartman "Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
"
13 11 Cartman "What dude?
"
13 11 Cartman "Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
"
13 11 Cartman "So that's what this has all been about?
"
13 11 Cartman "Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
"
13 12 Cartman "Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
"
13 12 Cartman "God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
"
13 12 Cartman "Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
"
13 12 Cartman "Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
"
13 12 Cartman "You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
"
13 12 Cartman "No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
"
13 12 Cartman "But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
13 12 Cartman "Agreed.
"
13 12 Cartman "Ni-nice, okay.
"
13 12 Cartman "What?
"
13 12 Cartman "I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
"
13 12 Cartman "Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
"
13 12 Cartman "I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
"
13 12 Cartman "That was us!
"
13 12 Cartman "Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
"
13 12 Cartman "Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
"
13 12 Cartman "You call them ""bike-curious"".
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
"
13 12 Cartman "Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
13 12 Cartman "Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
"
13 12 Cartman "No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
"
13 12 Cartman "Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh. My. Goodddd.
"
13 13 Cartman "Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
"
13 13 Cartman "He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
"
13 13 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
"
13 13 Cartman "Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
"
13 13 Cartman "Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
"
13 13 Cartman "But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
"
13 13 Cartman "You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
13 13 Cartman "Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
13 13 Cartman "You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
"
13 13 Cartman "Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
"
13 13 Cartman "- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"
13 13 Cartman "Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
"
13 13 Cartman "Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
"
13 13 Cartman "I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
"
13 13 Cartman """Thank you"" and this is to..?
"
13 13 Cartman """To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
"
13 13 Cartman "Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
"
13 13 Cartman "Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
"
13 13 Cartman "That'll be five dollars.
"
13 13 Cartman "A book signing.
"
13 13 Cartman "I do not directly say she's a slut!
"
13 13 Cartman "You didn't read the rest, dude.
"
13 13 Cartman """Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
"
13 13 Cartman "You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
"
13 13 Cartman "And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
"
13 13 Cartman "Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
"
13 13 Cartman "Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
"
13 13 Cartman "The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"
13 13 Cartman "Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
"
13 13 Cartman "And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
"
13 13 Cartman "Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
"
13 13 Cartman "People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
"
13 13 Cartman "Of course. That's why we're here.
"
13 13 Cartman "Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
"
13 13 Cartman "Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
"
13 13 Cartman "How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
"
13 13 Cartman "You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
"
13 13 Cartman "Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
"
13 13 Cartman "If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
"
13 13 Cartman "You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
"
13 13 Cartman "Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
"
13 13 Cartman "What? What do you mean I know that?
"
13 13 Cartman "No! You wiped them all out!
"
13 13 Cartman "Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
"
13 13 Cartman "Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
"
13 13 Cartman "No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
"
13 13 Cartman "You sold the movie rights to who?!
"
13 13 Cartman "Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
"
13 13 Cartman "Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
13 13 Cartman "Huh!
"
13 13 Cartman "No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
"
13 13 Cartman "I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
"
13 13 Cartman "I'm doin' the best I can! 
"
13 14 Cartman "We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
"
13 14 Cartman "This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
"
13 14 Cartman "No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
13 14 Cartman "You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
"
13 14 Cartman "Come on, let's go!
"
13 14 Cartman "Six adorable children please.
"
13 14 Cartman "Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13 14 Cartman "Forget it! Just forget it! 
"
13 14 Cartman "What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
"
13 14 Cartman "Just do it in English!
"
13 14 Cartman "There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
"
13 14 Cartman "You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
"
13 14 Cartman "I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
13 14 Cartman "So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
"
13 14 Cartman "...What do you mean?
"
13 14 Cartman "The black and brown people.
"
13 14 Cartman "Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
"
13 14 Cartman "Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
"
13 14 Cartman "The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
13 14 Cartman "You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
"
13 14 Cartman "Help! Help!
"
13 14 Cartman "Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
"
13 14 Cartman "Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
13 14 Cartman "Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
"
13 14 Cartman "It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
"
13 14 Cartman "I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
13 14 Cartman "...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
"
13 14 Cartman "Well, I do just as much work.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
"
13 14 Cartman "Noooo...
"
13 14 Cartman "NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
"
13 14 Cartman "Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
"
13 14 Cartman "Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
"
13 14 Cartman "It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
"
