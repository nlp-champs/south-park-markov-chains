4 1 Kyle "Oh yeah?!
"
4 1 Kyle "Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
"
4 1 Kyle "Fatass.
"
4 1 Kyle "What the hell are they doing?
"
4 1 Kyle "Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
"
4 1 Kyle "Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
"
4 1 Kyle "We killed Kenny?
"
4 1 Kyle "Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
"
4 1 Kyle "If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
"
4 1 Kyle "How?
"
4 1 Kyle "Sweet! Let's go!
"
4 1 Kyle "Hey, fatass. How's prison?
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
"
4 1 Kyle "An ailnay ilefay.
"
4 1 Kyle "Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
"
4 1 Kyle "They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
"
4 1 Kyle "Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
"
4 1 Kyle "Me too.
"
4 1 Kyle "Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
"
4 1 Kyle "So now what do we do?
"
4 1 Kyle "Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
"
4 1 Kyle "Killer.
"
4 1 Kyle "Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
"
4 1 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 1 Kyle "Why not?
"
4 1 Kyle "I don't start, you start.
"
4 1 Kyle "And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
"
4 1 Kyle "But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
"
4 1 Kyle "He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
"
4 1 Kyle "Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
"
4 1 Kyle "On the sled, fatass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Go, fatass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
"
4 1 Kyle "We won! We won!
"
4 1 Kyle "It's good to have you back, Cartman.
"
4 2 Kyle "He's fat and he's stupid?
"
4 2 Kyle "No way!
"
4 2 Kyle "I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
"
4 2 Kyle "...Totally what?
"
4 2 Kyle "Me too. 
"
4 2 Kyle "You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
"
4 2 Kyle "Almost. You ready, Timmy?
"
4 2 Kyle "When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
"
4 2 Kyle "Right. You're Timmy.
"
4 2 Kyle "Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
"
4 2 Kyle "Yeah, let's go. 
"
4 2 Kyle "No, Timmy, wait!
"
4 2 Kyle "Come on, fatass!
"
4 2 Kyle "Did the tooth fairy come?
"
4 2 Kyle "Four dollars?
"
4 2 Kyle "No more money??
"
4 2 Kyle "Cartman, what's going on?!
"
4 2 Kyle "What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?""
"
4 2 Kyle "That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
"
4 2 Kyle "You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
"
4 2 Kyle "It's not true! 
"
4 2 Kyle "Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"
4 2 Kyle "Peter Pan, too??
"
4 2 Kyle "What about Moses and Abraham?
"
4 2 Kyle "Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
"
4 2 Kyle "Wahahahah!
"
4 2 Kyle "Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
"
4 2 Kyle "What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
"
4 2 Kyle "All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
"
4 2 Kyle "I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
"
4 2 Kyle "What if this is all just somebody's dream?
"
4 2 Kyle "Two years?
"
4 2 Kyle "Cartman!
"
4 2 Kyle "See ya.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
"
4 2 Kyle "I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
"
4 2 Kyle "But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
"
4 2 Kyle "Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
"
4 2 Kyle "Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
"
4 2 Kyle "I am nothing, and everything.
"
4 2 Kyle "Hunh. That was pretty weird.
"
4 2 Kyle "Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
"
4 3 Kyle "Awwww!
"
4 3 Kyle "How long does this thing last?
"
4 3 Kyle "Whoa. 
"
4 3 Kyle "Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
"
4 3 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
"
4 3 Kyle "Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
"
4 3 Kyle "Let's go practice. 
"
4 3 Kyle "It's Kenny's singing!
"
4 3 Kyle "What?! 
"
4 3 Kyle "What's a ""quin-tuplet""?
"
4 3 Kyle "But there's only four of you.
"
4 3 Kyle "So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
"
4 3 Kyle "How can you say that?
"
4 3 Kyle "Oh, yeah!
"
4 3 Kyle "Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
"
4 3 Kyle "You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
"
4 3 Kyle "Alright!
"
4 3 Kyle "Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
"
4 3 Kyle "Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
"
4 3 Kyle "Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
"
4 4 Kyle "The Declaration of Independence?
"
4 4 Kyle "Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
"
4 4 Kyle "...I am eight.
"
4 4 Kyle "No way! 
"
4 4 Kyle "Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
"
4 4 Kyle "We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
"
4 4 Kyle "That's correct, Chef.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
"
4 4 Kyle "No, not at all. 
"
4 4 Kyle "Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes, let's. 
"
4 4 Kyle "You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
"
4 4 Kyle "Bastard.
"
4 4 Kyle "Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Come, see him with us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah!
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
"
4 6 Kyle "Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
"
4 6 Kyle "What?
"
4 6 Kyle "AIDS?! 
"
4 6 Kyle "What?
"
4 6 Kyle "You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
"
4 6 Kyle "See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
"
4 6 Kyle "I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
"
4 6 Kyle "Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
"
4 6 Kyle "Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
"
4 6 Kyle "What are you talking about, fatass?
"
4 6 Kyle "They are?
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't wanna go!
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't WANNA go!
"
4 6 Kyle "Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
"
4 6 Kyle "Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. Being mature is boring!
"
4 6 Kyle "I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
"
4 6 Kyle "How?
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4 6 Kyle "Seriously.
"
4 6 Kyle "Well, Cartman
"
4 6 Kyle "Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
"
4 7 Kyle "I don't know, I...
"
4 7 Kyle "How much?
"
4 7 Kyle "Better, thanks.
"
4 7 Kyle "Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
"
4 7 Kyle "Oh. ...Thanks?
"
4 7 Kyle "Huh?  What the?
"
4 8 Kyle "Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
"
4 8 Kyle "Told ya.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, we got it.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, me neither.
"
4 8 Kyle "Not really.
"
4 8 Kyle "Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
"
4 8 Kyle "Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
"
4 8 Kyle "I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
"
4 8 Kyle "Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Pretty good, I guess.
"
4 8 Kyle "Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
"
4 8 Kyle "Oh.
"
4 8 Kyle "Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 8 Kyle "W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
4 8 Kyle "Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
"
4 8 Kyle "No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
"
4 9 Kyle "...How?
"
4 9 Kyle "I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
"
4 9 Kyle "Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
"
4 9 Kyle "So, all boy bands have five members.
"
4 9 Kyle "'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
"
4 9 Kyle "It was?
"
4 9 Kyle "I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
"
4 9 Kyle "Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
"
4 9 Kyle "Me too.
"
4 9 Kyle "I wanna be the tough one.
"
4 9 Kyle "I wanna be the tough one!
"
4 9 Kyle "Jews are tough!
"
4 9 Kyle "Since Abraham, fatass!
"
4 9 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
4 9 Kyle "Wow. I feel so rejected.
"
4 9 Kyle "Run for it! 
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
"
4 9 Kyle "Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
"
4 9 Kyle "He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
"
4 9 Kyle "Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
"
4 9 Kyle "It's Stan! 
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, where the hell have you been?!
"
4 9 Kyle "You bastards!
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, he's pretty dead.
"
4 9 Kyle "We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
"
4 9 Kyle "We made two dollars.
"
4 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
4 9 Kyle "...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
"
4 9 Kyle "Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
"
4 10 Kyle "Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
"
4 10 Kyle "Uhwuwhat?
"
4 10 Kyle "No-o-o-o-o!
"
4 10 Kyle "Oh good. I don't?
"
4 10 Kyle "I am not!
"
4 10 Kyle "I'm gonna go ask my mom! 
"
4 10 Kyle "Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
"
4 10 Kyle "Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
"
4 10 Kyle "We don't? But what if we're wrong?
"
4 10 Kyle "Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
"
4 10 Kyle "Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
"
4 10 Kyle "Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
"
4 10 Kyle "Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
"
4 10 Kyle "Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
"
4 10 Kyle "HAAAAH!
"
4 11 Kyle "But what if we're wrong?
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
"
4 11 Kyle "Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
"
4 11 Kyle "Ask him what hell is like.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
4 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
4 11 Kyle "Ow! 
"
4 11 Kyle "Uh, I think so.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
"
4 11 Kyle "You're keeping that money yourself?
"
4 11 Kyle "Then why didn't you tell us?!
"
4 11 Kyle "The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
"
4 11 Kyle "Serves you right, Cartman!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
"
4 12 Kyle "Ungh, gay, dude.
"
4 12 Kyle "You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
"
4 12 Kyle "He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
"
4 12 Kyle "...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
"
4 12 Kyle "Together we are strong! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
"
4 12 Kyle "Holy God, dude!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! 
"
4 12 Kyle "And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
"
4 12 Kyle "I just didn't think it would come so soon.
"
4 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 12 Kyle "Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
"
4 12 Kyle "How?
"
4 12 Kyle "Oh yeah, time travel.
"
4 12 Kyle "Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
"
4 12 Kyle "So can you do it?
"
4 12 Kyle "I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
"
4 12 Kyle "Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
"
4 12 Kyle "Come on! 
"
4 12 Kyle "What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
"
4 12 Kyle "No??
"
4 12 Kyle "Oh no! What have we done?!
"
4 12 Kyle "What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
"
4 12 Kyle "Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
"
4 12 Kyle "Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Hey, Timmy's back!
"
4 13 Kyle "Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
"
4 13 Kyle "Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
"
4 13 Kyle "But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
"
4 13 Kyle "Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
"
4 13 Kyle "He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
"
4 13 Kyle "He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
"
4 13 Kyle "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
"
4 13 Kyle "You are?
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "No, I don't! I don't care!
"
4 13 Kyle "Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm gonna!
"
4 13 Kyle "I will!
"
4 13 Kyle "Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
"
4 13 Kyle "Whoa, dude..!
"
4 13 Kyle "Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
"
4 13 Kyle "That should do it.
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
"
4 13 Kyle "Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "Hey! What are you doing?
"
4 13 Kyle "Oh... Okay.
"
4 13 Kyle "Yeah, that'd be faster.
"
4 13 Kyle "Here we go again.
"
4 13 Kyle "Dammit, Cartman, open up!
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"
4 13 Kyle "Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
"
4 13 Kyle "You ba--! 
"
4 13 Kyle "Why is that bad?
"
4 13 Kyle "Step on it, Bill Cosby! 
"
4 13 Kyle "Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
"
4 13 Kyle "Screw you, fat ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
4 13 Kyle "No!
"
4 13 Kyle "I can't reach the CPU.
"
4 13 Kyle "Got 'em!
"
4 14 Kyle "I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
"
4 14 Kyle "Can we take a lunch break now?
"
4 14 Kyle "What is it, Butters?
"
4 14 Kyle "We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
"
4 14 Kyle "Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
"
4 14 Kyle "Okay!
"
4 14 Kyle "A smart one, that can do tricks.
"
4 14 Kyle "Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
"
4 14 Kyle "What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
"
4 14 Kyle "Alright, we'll take him. How much?
"
4 14 Kyle "But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
"
4 14 Kyle "...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 
"
4 14 Kyle "Aw, blow it out your ass!
"
4 14 Kyle "It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
"
4 14 Kyle "Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
"
4 14 Kyle "I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
"
4 14 Kyle "Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
"
4 14 Kyle "Timmy, we already got a turkey.
"
4 14 Kyle "Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
"
4 14 Kyle "What Butters? 
"
4 14 Kyle "So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
"
4 14 Kyle "You ready for the big show, Timmy?
"
4 14 Kyle "Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
"
4 14 Kyle "He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
"
4 14 Kyle "Hey, look! 
"
4 14 Kyle "Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
"
4 14 Kyle "Butters told us their play was awesome! 
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
"
4 15 Kyle "Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, dude, check this out. 
"
4 15 Kyle "Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
"
4 15 Kyle "I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
"
4 15 Kyle "Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
"
4 15 Kyle "What's the matter?
"
4 15 Kyle "Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
"
4 15 Kyle "I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
"
4 15 Kyle "That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 
"
4 15 Kyle "Kick ass, dude!
"
4 15 Kyle "Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
"
4 15 Kyle "Whoa! 
"
4 15 Kyle "What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
"
4 15 Kyle "Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
"
4 15 Kyle "Good point.
"
4 15 Kyle "Huh? Why not?
"
4 15 Kyle "I don't know.
"
4 15 Kyle "Why?
"
4 15 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
"
4 15 Kyle "Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
"
4 15 Kyle "Six hours.
"
4 15 Kyle "Great.
"
4 15 Kyle "For what?
"
4 15 Kyle "Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
"
4 15 Kyle "He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
"
4 15 Kyle "...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
"
4 15 Kyle "Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
"
4 15 Kyle "Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
"
4 15 Kyle "Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
"
4 16 Kyle "Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
"
4 16 Kyle "Hepatitis B?
"
4 16 Kyle "...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
"
4 16 Kyle "Hold on. I'll be right back. 
"
4 16 Kyle "Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
"
4 16 Kyle "But all the guys are going!
"
4 16 Kyle "But Mom, I-
"
4 16 Kyle "Ugh! 
"
4 16 Kyle "My parents said I can't go.
"
4 16 Kyle "Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
"
4 16 Kyle "No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
"
4 16 Kyle "...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
"
4 16 Kyle "What's Cuba?
"
4 16 Kyle "And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
"
4 16 Kyle "Hoh, geez. 
"
4 16 Kyle "Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
"
4 16 Kyle "And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
"
4 16 Kyle "I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
"
4 16 Kyle "What??
"
4 16 Kyle "But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
"
4 16 Kyle "But that's not fair! You lied to me!
"
4 16 Kyle "What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
"
4 16 Kyle "Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
"
4 16 Kyle "It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
"
4 16 Kyle "They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
"
4 16 Kyle "How?!
"
4 16 Kyle "What's that?
"
4 16 Kyle "Wow! Three months without parents!
"
4 16 Kyle "Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
"
4 16 Kyle """My parents molestered me.""
"
4 16 Kyle "What's ""bad touch""?
"
4 16 Kyle "Okay, molestered, bad touch.
"
4 16 Kyle "Cool, thanks.
"
4 16 Kyle "...Nothing.
"
4 16 Kyle "Not one adult left?
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 16 Kyle "The fatass. The mayor.
"
4 16 Kyle "Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
"
4 16 Kyle "Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
"
4 16 Kyle "Parents. Mom. Dad.
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
"
4 16 Kyle "Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
"
4 16 Kyle "Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
"
4 16 Kyle "Did you make it to your job interview?
"
4 16 Kyle "Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
"
4 16 Kyle "Mom! Dad!
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. We're fine.
"
4 16 Kyle "But you didn't do anything to me.
"
4 16 Kyle "But, you guys, I--
"
4 16 Kyle "Huh.
"
4 16 Kyle "Sure. 
"
4 17 Kyle "He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
"
4 17 Kyle "Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
"
4 17 Kyle "Happy Chanukah, Mom. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Go away!
"
4 17 Kyle "Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, good. You're all here.
"
4 17 Kyle "It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
"
4 17 Kyle "It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
"
4 17 Kyle "If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
"
4 17 Kyle "Dude, you sneezed on my back!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey, look.  Hello?
"
4 17 Kyle "...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
"
4 17 Kyle "But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
"
4 17 Kyle "A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
"
4 17 Kyle "Sure we'll help! 
"
4 17 Kyle "Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
"
4 17 Kyle "We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
"
4 17 Kyle "How hard can it be? Look at it. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
"
4 17 Kyle "We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
"
4 17 Kyle "You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"
4 17 Kyle "Ah, Mr. Hankey?
"
4 17 Kyle "We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
"
4 17 Kyle "Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
"
4 17 Kyle "They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
"
4 17 Kyle "God job, Butters.
"
4 17 Kyle "See ya! 
"
4 17 Kyle "No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
"
4 17 Kyle "What's a hard p?
"
4 17 Kyle "Oh, yeah.
"
4 17 Kyle "We wish- 
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Well, yes, I think so.
"
4 17 Kyle "Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
"
4 17 Kyle "Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
"
4 17 Kyle "Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"
4 17 Kyle "Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
"
4 17 Kyle "That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
"
4 17 Kyle "Now, the next mouth.
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, where are the E-mouths?
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?
"
4 17 Kyle "So how much done is that?
"
4 17 Kyle "Aw,  Jesus Christ!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Cartman!
"
4 17 Kyle "Fine! We'll do it with out you!
"
4 17 Kyle "We'll dub his voice over.
"
4 17 Kyle "Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
"
4 17 Kyle "You love-
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll labor. 
"
4 17 Kyle "You sit- 
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll stand. 
"
4 17 Kyle "You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
"
4 17 Kyle "Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
"
4 17 Kyle "Cool! Now let's try the script!
"
4 17 Kyle "Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
"
4 17 Kyle "You wish-
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll whittle.
"
4 17 Kyle "You sit- 
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll stand. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
"
4 17 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, Mr. Hankey!
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah, I think so.
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
"
4 17 Kyle "All that hard work.
"
4 17 Kyle "But we spent it!
"
4 17 Kyle "All that work!
"
4 17 Kyle "Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
"
4 17 Kyle "What the--
"
4 17 Kyle "They did it! They got it working! 
"
4 17 Kyle "...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
"
4 17 Kyle "Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Ah.
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah.
"
4 17 Kyle "You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
"
4 1 Kyle "Oh yeah?!
"
4 1 Kyle "Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
"
4 1 Kyle "Fatass.
"
4 1 Kyle "What the hell are they doing?
"
4 1 Kyle "Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
"
4 1 Kyle "Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
"
4 1 Kyle "We killed Kenny?
"
4 1 Kyle "Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
"
4 1 Kyle "If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
"
4 1 Kyle "How?
"
4 1 Kyle "Sweet! Let's go!
"
4 1 Kyle "Hey, fatass. How's prison?
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
"
4 1 Kyle "An ailnay ilefay.
"
4 1 Kyle "Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
"
4 1 Kyle "They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
"
4 1 Kyle "Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
"
4 1 Kyle "Me too.
"
4 1 Kyle "Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
"
4 1 Kyle "So now what do we do?
"
4 1 Kyle "Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
"
4 1 Kyle "Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
"
4 1 Kyle "Killer.
"
4 1 Kyle "Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
"
4 1 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 1 Kyle "Why not?
"
4 1 Kyle "I don't start, you start.
"
4 1 Kyle "And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
"
4 1 Kyle "But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
"
4 1 Kyle "He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
"
4 1 Kyle "Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
"
4 1 Kyle "On the sled, fatass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Go, fatass!
"
4 1 Kyle "Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
"
4 1 Kyle "We won! We won!
"
4 1 Kyle "It's good to have you back, Cartman.
"
4 2 Kyle "He's fat and he's stupid?
"
4 2 Kyle "No way!
"
4 2 Kyle "I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
"
4 2 Kyle "...Totally what?
"
4 2 Kyle "Me too. 
"
4 2 Kyle "You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
"
4 2 Kyle "Almost. You ready, Timmy?
"
4 2 Kyle "When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
"
4 2 Kyle "Right. You're Timmy.
"
4 2 Kyle "Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
"
4 2 Kyle "Yeah, let's go. 
"
4 2 Kyle "No, Timmy, wait!
"
4 2 Kyle "Come on, fatass!
"
4 2 Kyle "Did the tooth fairy come?
"
4 2 Kyle "Four dollars?
"
4 2 Kyle "No more money??
"
4 2 Kyle "Cartman, what's going on?!
"
4 2 Kyle "What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?""
"
4 2 Kyle "That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
"
4 2 Kyle "You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
"
4 2 Kyle "It's not true! 
"
4 2 Kyle "Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"
4 2 Kyle "Peter Pan, too??
"
4 2 Kyle "What about Moses and Abraham?
"
4 2 Kyle "Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
"
4 2 Kyle "Wahahahah!
"
4 2 Kyle "Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
"
4 2 Kyle "What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
"
4 2 Kyle "All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
"
4 2 Kyle "I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
"
4 2 Kyle "What if this is all just somebody's dream?
"
4 2 Kyle "Two years?
"
4 2 Kyle "Cartman!
"
4 2 Kyle "See ya.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
"
4 2 Kyle "Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
"
4 2 Kyle "Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
"
4 2 Kyle "I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
"
4 2 Kyle "But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
"
4 2 Kyle "Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
"
4 2 Kyle "Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
"
4 2 Kyle "I am nothing, and everything.
"
4 2 Kyle "Hunh. That was pretty weird.
"
4 2 Kyle "Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
"
4 3 Kyle "Awwww!
"
4 3 Kyle "How long does this thing last?
"
4 3 Kyle "Whoa. 
"
4 3 Kyle "Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
"
4 3 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
"
4 3 Kyle "Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
"
4 3 Kyle "Let's go practice. 
"
4 3 Kyle "It's Kenny's singing!
"
4 3 Kyle "What?! 
"
4 3 Kyle "What's a ""quin-tuplet""?
"
4 3 Kyle "But there's only four of you.
"
4 3 Kyle "So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
"
4 3 Kyle "How can you say that?
"
4 3 Kyle "Oh, yeah!
"
4 3 Kyle "Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
"
4 3 Kyle "You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
"
4 3 Kyle "Alright!
"
4 3 Kyle "Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
"
4 3 Kyle "Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
"
4 3 Kyle "Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
"
4 4 Kyle "The Declaration of Independence?
"
4 4 Kyle "Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
"
4 4 Kyle "...I am eight.
"
4 4 Kyle "No way! 
"
4 4 Kyle "Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
"
4 4 Kyle "We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
"
4 4 Kyle "That's correct, Chef.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
"
4 4 Kyle "No, not at all. 
"
4 4 Kyle "Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes, let's. 
"
4 4 Kyle "You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
"
4 4 Kyle "Bastard.
"
4 4 Kyle "Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Come, see him with us.
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah!
"
4 4 Kyle "Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
"
4 6 Kyle "Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
"
4 6 Kyle "What?
"
4 6 Kyle "AIDS?! 
"
4 6 Kyle "What?
"
4 6 Kyle "You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
"
4 6 Kyle "See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
"
4 6 Kyle "I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
"
4 6 Kyle "Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
"
4 6 Kyle "Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
"
4 6 Kyle "What are you talking about, fatass?
"
4 6 Kyle "They are?
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't wanna go!
"
4 6 Kyle "We don't WANNA go!
"
4 6 Kyle "Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
"
4 6 Kyle "Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. Being mature is boring!
"
4 6 Kyle "I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
"
4 6 Kyle "How?
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4 6 Kyle "Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4 6 Kyle "Seriously.
"
4 6 Kyle "Well, Cartman
"
4 6 Kyle "Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
"
4 7 Kyle "I don't know, I...
"
4 7 Kyle "How much?
"
4 7 Kyle "Better, thanks.
"
4 7 Kyle "Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
"
4 7 Kyle "Oh. ...Thanks?
"
4 7 Kyle "Huh?  What the?
"
4 8 Kyle "Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
"
4 8 Kyle "Told ya.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, we got it.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, me neither.
"
4 8 Kyle "Not really.
"
4 8 Kyle "Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
"
4 8 Kyle "Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
"
4 8 Kyle "I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
"
4 8 Kyle "Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Pretty good, I guess.
"
4 8 Kyle "Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
"
4 8 Kyle "Oh.
"
4 8 Kyle "Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 8 Kyle "W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
4 8 Kyle "Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
"
4 8 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 8 Kyle "Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
"
4 8 Kyle "No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
"
4 9 Kyle "...How?
"
4 9 Kyle "I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
"
4 9 Kyle "Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
"
4 9 Kyle "So, all boy bands have five members.
"
4 9 Kyle "'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
"
4 9 Kyle "It was?
"
4 9 Kyle "I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
"
4 9 Kyle "Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
"
4 9 Kyle "Me too.
"
4 9 Kyle "I wanna be the tough one.
"
4 9 Kyle "I wanna be the tough one!
"
4 9 Kyle "Jews are tough!
"
4 9 Kyle "Since Abraham, fatass!
"
4 9 Kyle "Jesus Christ!
"
4 9 Kyle "Wow. I feel so rejected.
"
4 9 Kyle "Run for it! 
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
"
4 9 Kyle "Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
"
4 9 Kyle "He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
"
4 9 Kyle "Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
"
4 9 Kyle "It's Stan! 
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, where the hell have you been?!
"
4 9 Kyle "You bastards!
"
4 9 Kyle "Dude, he's pretty dead.
"
4 9 Kyle "We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
"
4 9 Kyle "We made two dollars.
"
4 9 Kyle "Yeah.
"
4 9 Kyle "...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
"
4 9 Kyle "Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
"
4 10 Kyle "Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
"
4 10 Kyle "Uhwuwhat?
"
4 10 Kyle "No-o-o-o-o!
"
4 10 Kyle "Oh good. I don't?
"
4 10 Kyle "I am not!
"
4 10 Kyle "I'm gonna go ask my mom! 
"
4 10 Kyle "Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
"
4 10 Kyle "Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
"
4 10 Kyle "We don't? But what if we're wrong?
"
4 10 Kyle "Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
"
4 10 Kyle "Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
"
4 10 Kyle "Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
"
4 10 Kyle "Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
"
4 10 Kyle "Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
"
4 10 Kyle "HAAAAH!
"
4 11 Kyle "But what if we're wrong?
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
"
4 11 Kyle "Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
"
4 11 Kyle "Ask him what hell is like.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
4 11 Kyle "Yes!
"
4 11 Kyle "Ow! 
"
4 11 Kyle "Uh, I think so.
"
4 11 Kyle "Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
"
4 11 Kyle "You're keeping that money yourself?
"
4 11 Kyle "Then why didn't you tell us?!
"
4 11 Kyle "The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
"
4 11 Kyle "Serves you right, Cartman!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
"
4 12 Kyle "Ungh, gay, dude.
"
4 12 Kyle "You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
"
4 12 Kyle "He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
"
4 12 Kyle "...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
"
4 12 Kyle "Together we are strong! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
"
4 12 Kyle "Holy God, dude!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! 
"
4 12 Kyle "And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
"
4 12 Kyle "I just didn't think it would come so soon.
"
4 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
4 12 Kyle "Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
"
4 12 Kyle "How?
"
4 12 Kyle "Oh yeah, time travel.
"
4 12 Kyle "Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
"
4 12 Kyle "So can you do it?
"
4 12 Kyle "I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
"
4 12 Kyle "Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
"
4 12 Kyle "Come on! 
"
4 12 Kyle "What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
"
4 12 Kyle "No??
"
4 12 Kyle "Oh no! What have we done?!
"
4 12 Kyle "What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
"
4 12 Kyle "Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
"
4 12 Kyle "Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
"
4 12 Kyle "Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
"
4 12 Kyle "Hey, Timmy's back!
"
4 13 Kyle "Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
"
4 13 Kyle "Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
"
4 13 Kyle "But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
"
4 13 Kyle "Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
"
4 13 Kyle "He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
"
4 13 Kyle "He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
"
4 13 Kyle "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
"
4 13 Kyle "You are?
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "No, I don't! I don't care!
"
4 13 Kyle "Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm gonna!
"
4 13 Kyle "I will!
"
4 13 Kyle "Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
"
4 13 Kyle "Whoa, dude..!
"
4 13 Kyle "Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
"
4 13 Kyle "That should do it.
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
"
4 13 Kyle "Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "Hey! What are you doing?
"
4 13 Kyle "Oh... Okay.
"
4 13 Kyle "Yeah, that'd be faster.
"
4 13 Kyle "Here we go again.
"
4 13 Kyle "Dammit, Cartman, open up!
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"
4 13 Kyle "Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
"
4 13 Kyle "You ba--! 
"
4 13 Kyle "Why is that bad?
"
4 13 Kyle "Step on it, Bill Cosby! 
"
4 13 Kyle "Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
"
4 13 Kyle "I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
"
4 13 Kyle "Screw you, fat ass!
"
4 13 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
4 13 Kyle "No!
"
4 13 Kyle "I can't reach the CPU.
"
4 13 Kyle "Got 'em!
"
4 14 Kyle "I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
"
4 14 Kyle "Can we take a lunch break now?
"
4 14 Kyle "What is it, Butters?
"
4 14 Kyle "We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
"
4 14 Kyle "Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
"
4 14 Kyle "Okay!
"
4 14 Kyle "A smart one, that can do tricks.
"
4 14 Kyle "Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
"
4 14 Kyle "What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
"
4 14 Kyle "Alright, we'll take him. How much?
"
4 14 Kyle "But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
"
4 14 Kyle "...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 
"
4 14 Kyle "Aw, blow it out your ass!
"
4 14 Kyle "It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
"
4 14 Kyle "Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
"
4 14 Kyle "I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
"
4 14 Kyle "Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
"
4 14 Kyle "Timmy, we already got a turkey.
"
4 14 Kyle "Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
"
4 14 Kyle "What Butters? 
"
4 14 Kyle "So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
"
4 14 Kyle "You ready for the big show, Timmy?
"
4 14 Kyle "Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
"
4 14 Kyle "He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
"
4 14 Kyle "Hey, look! 
"
4 14 Kyle "Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
"
4 14 Kyle "Butters told us their play was awesome! 
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
"
4 15 Kyle "Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, dude, check this out. 
"
4 15 Kyle "Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
"
4 15 Kyle "I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
"
4 15 Kyle "Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
"
4 15 Kyle "What's the matter?
"
4 15 Kyle "Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
"
4 15 Kyle "Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
"
4 15 Kyle "I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
"
4 15 Kyle "That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 
"
4 15 Kyle "Kick ass, dude!
"
4 15 Kyle "Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
"
4 15 Kyle "Whoa! 
"
4 15 Kyle "What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
"
4 15 Kyle "Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
"
4 15 Kyle "Good point.
"
4 15 Kyle "Huh? Why not?
"
4 15 Kyle "I don't know.
"
4 15 Kyle "Why?
"
4 15 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
"
4 15 Kyle "Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
"
4 15 Kyle "Six hours.
"
4 15 Kyle "Great.
"
4 15 Kyle "For what?
"
4 15 Kyle "Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
"
4 15 Kyle "He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
"
4 15 Kyle "...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
"
4 15 Kyle "Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
"
4 15 Kyle "Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
"
4 15 Kyle "Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
"
4 16 Kyle "Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
"
4 16 Kyle "Hepatitis B?
"
4 16 Kyle "...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
"
4 16 Kyle "Hold on. I'll be right back. 
"
4 16 Kyle "Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
"
4 16 Kyle "But all the guys are going!
"
4 16 Kyle "But Mom, I-
"
4 16 Kyle "Ugh! 
"
4 16 Kyle "My parents said I can't go.
"
4 16 Kyle "Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
"
4 16 Kyle "No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
"
4 16 Kyle "...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
"
4 16 Kyle "What's Cuba?
"
4 16 Kyle "And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
"
4 16 Kyle "Hoh, geez. 
"
4 16 Kyle "Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
"
4 16 Kyle "And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
"
4 16 Kyle "I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
"
4 16 Kyle "What??
"
4 16 Kyle "But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
"
4 16 Kyle "But that's not fair! You lied to me!
"
4 16 Kyle "What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
"
4 16 Kyle "Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
"
4 16 Kyle "It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
"
4 16 Kyle "They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
"
4 16 Kyle "How?!
"
4 16 Kyle "What's that?
"
4 16 Kyle "Wow! Three months without parents!
"
4 16 Kyle "Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
"
4 16 Kyle """My parents molestered me.""
"
4 16 Kyle "What's ""bad touch""?
"
4 16 Kyle "Okay, molestered, bad touch.
"
4 16 Kyle "Cool, thanks.
"
4 16 Kyle "...Nothing.
"
4 16 Kyle "Not one adult left?
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. 
"
4 16 Kyle "The fatass. The mayor.
"
4 16 Kyle "Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
"
4 16 Kyle "Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
"
4 16 Kyle "Parents. Mom. Dad.
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
"
4 16 Kyle "Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
"
4 16 Kyle "Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
"
4 16 Kyle "Did you make it to your job interview?
"
4 16 Kyle "Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
"
4 16 Kyle "Mom! Dad!
"
4 16 Kyle "Yeah. We're fine.
"
4 16 Kyle "But you didn't do anything to me.
"
4 16 Kyle "But, you guys, I--
"
4 16 Kyle "Huh.
"
4 16 Kyle "Sure. 
"
4 17 Kyle "He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
"
4 17 Kyle "Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
"
4 17 Kyle "Happy Chanukah, Mom. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Go away!
"
4 17 Kyle "Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, good. You're all here.
"
4 17 Kyle "It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
"
4 17 Kyle "It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
"
4 17 Kyle "If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
"
4 17 Kyle "Dude, you sneezed on my back!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey, look.  Hello?
"
4 17 Kyle "...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
"
4 17 Kyle "But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
"
4 17 Kyle "A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
"
4 17 Kyle "Sure we'll help! 
"
4 17 Kyle "Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
"
4 17 Kyle "We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
"
4 17 Kyle "How hard can it be? Look at it. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
"
4 17 Kyle "We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
"
4 17 Kyle "You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"
4 17 Kyle "Ah, Mr. Hankey?
"
4 17 Kyle "We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
"
4 17 Kyle "Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
"
4 17 Kyle "They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
"
4 17 Kyle "God job, Butters.
"
4 17 Kyle "See ya! 
"
4 17 Kyle "No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
"
4 17 Kyle "What's a hard p?
"
4 17 Kyle "Oh, yeah.
"
4 17 Kyle "We wish- 
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Well, yes, I think so.
"
4 17 Kyle "Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
"
4 17 Kyle "Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
"
4 17 Kyle "Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"
4 17 Kyle "Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
"
4 17 Kyle "That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
"
4 17 Kyle "Now, the next mouth.
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, where are the E-mouths?
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?
"
4 17 Kyle "So how much done is that?
"
4 17 Kyle "Aw,  Jesus Christ!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Cartman!
"
4 17 Kyle "Fine! We'll do it with out you!
"
4 17 Kyle "We'll dub his voice over.
"
4 17 Kyle "Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
"
4 17 Kyle "You love-
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll labor. 
"
4 17 Kyle "You sit- 
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll stand. 
"
4 17 Kyle "You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
"
4 17 Kyle "Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
"
4 17 Kyle "Cool! Now let's try the script!
"
4 17 Kyle "Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
"
4 17 Kyle "You wish-
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll whittle.
"
4 17 Kyle "You sit- 
"
4 17 Kyle "-And I'll stand. 
"
4 17 Kyle "Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
"
4 17 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
"
4 17 Kyle "Okay, Mr. Hankey!
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah, I think so.
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
"
4 17 Kyle "All that hard work.
"
4 17 Kyle "But we spent it!
"
4 17 Kyle "All that work!
"
4 17 Kyle "Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
"
4 17 Kyle "What the--
"
4 17 Kyle "They did it! They got it working! 
"
4 17 Kyle "...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
"
4 17 Kyle "Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
"
4 17 Kyle "What?
"
4 17 Kyle "Ah.
"
4 17 Kyle "Yeah.
"
4 17 Kyle "You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
"
4 17 Kyle "Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
"
