12 1 Butters "How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you.

"
12 9 Butters "Almost time. 
"
12 9 Butters "Huh.
"
12 9 Butters "Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
12 9 Butters "But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
"
12 9 Butters "That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
12 9 Butters "That way it won't matter if you get detention.
"
12 9 Butters "Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
12 9 Butters "Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
"
12 9 Butters "She chickened out!

"
12 13 Butters "Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
"
12 13 Butters "Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
"
12 13 Butters "Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
"
12 13 Butters "Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
"
12 13 Butters "No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
"
12 14 Butters "Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
"
12 14 Butters "There's vampires in the school!
"
12 14 Butters "Vampires. I've seen them.
"
12 14 Butters "Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
12 14 Butters "But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
"
12 14 Butters "Really? Do you think that's best?
"
12 14 Butters "All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
12 14 Butters "12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
"
12 14 Butters "Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
"
12 14 Butters "That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"
12 14 Butters "Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
"
12 14 Butters "Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
"
12 14 Butters "Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
"
12 14 Butters "Oh no, what did I do this time?
"
12 14 Butters "Oh Jeez...
"
12 14 Butters "I have no idea, sir.
"
12 14 Butters "Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
"
12 14 Butters "A well-organized pantry.
"
12 14 Butters "Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
"
12 14 Butters "Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
"
12 14 Butters "Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
"
12 14 Butters "O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
"
12 14 Butters "Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
12 14 Butters "Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
"
12 14 Butters "Yes! Yes, anything else?
"
12 14 Butters "Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
12 14 Butters "I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
"
12 14 Butters "Yeah, I guess.
"
12 14 Butters "Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
"
12 14 Butters "Whoa.
"
12 14 Butters "Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
"
12 14 Butters "I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
"
12 14 Butters "You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
12 14 Butters "I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
"
12 14 Butters "Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
12 14 Butters "I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
12 14 Butters "I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
12 14 Butters "U-huh.  Ow.
"
12 14 Butters "What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
12 14 Butters "Hey Dad. 
"
12 14 Butters "I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
"
12 14 Butters "Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
12 14 Butters "Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
12 14 Butters "Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
12 14 Butters "I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
12 14 Butters "Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
12 14 Butters "They're putting an end to it! 
"
12 14 Butters "Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
12 14 Butters "Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
12 14 Butters "What's that, Dad?
"
12 14 Butters "Uh oh.
"
12 14 Butters "Ahh, dangit! 
"
12 1 Butters "Oh no.
"
12 1 Butters "How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you.

12 1 Butters "Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.

"
12 1 Butters "Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
12 1 Butters "Wow, you really know what you're doing.

12 8 Butters "So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?

12 9 Butters "I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
"
12 9 Butters "Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
"
12 9 Butters "Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
"
12 9 Butters "Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
"
12 9 Butters "Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
"
12 9 Butters "Almost time. 
"
12 9 Butters "Huh.
"
12 9 Butters "Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
12 9 Butters "But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
"
12 9 Butters "That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
12 9 Butters "That way it won't matter if you get detention.
"
12 9 Butters "Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
12 9 Butters "Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
"
12 9 Butters "She chickened out!

12 9 Butters "She's coming! She's coming!

"
12 13 Butters "Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
"
12 13 Butters "Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
"
12 13 Butters "Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
"
12 13 Butters "Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
"
12 13 Butters "No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
"
12 14 Butters "Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
"
12 14 Butters "There's vampires in the school!
"
12 14 Butters "Vampires. I've seen them.
"
12 14 Butters "Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
12 14 Butters "But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
"
12 14 Butters "Really? Do you think that's best?
"
12 14 Butters "All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
12 14 Butters "12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
"
12 14 Butters "Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
"
12 14 Butters "That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"
12 14 Butters "Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
"
12 14 Butters "Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
"
12 14 Butters "Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
"
12 14 Butters "Oh no, what did I do this time?
"
12 14 Butters "Oh Jeez...
"
12 14 Butters "I have no idea, sir.
"
12 14 Butters "Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
"
12 14 Butters "A well-organized pantry.
"
12 14 Butters "Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
"
12 14 Butters "Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
"
12 14 Butters "Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
"
12 14 Butters "O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
"
12 14 Butters "Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
12 14 Butters "Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
"
12 14 Butters "Yes! Yes, anything else?
"
12 14 Butters "Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
12 14 Butters "I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
"
12 14 Butters "Yeah, I guess.
"
12 14 Butters "Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
"
12 14 Butters "Whoa.
"
12 14 Butters "Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
"
12 14 Butters "I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
"
12 14 Butters "You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
12 14 Butters "I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
"
12 14 Butters "Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
12 14 Butters "I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
12 14 Butters "I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
12 14 Butters "U-huh.  Ow.
"
12 14 Butters "What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
12 14 Butters "Hey Dad. 
"
12 14 Butters "I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
"
12 14 Butters "Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
12 14 Butters "Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
12 14 Butters "Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
12 14 Butters "I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
12 14 Butters "Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
12 14 Butters "They're putting an end to it! 
"
12 14 Butters "Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
12 14 Butters "Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
12 14 Butters "What's that, Dad?
"
12 14 Butters "Uh oh.
"
12 14 Butters "Ahh, dangit! 
"
12 1 Butters "Oh no.
"
12 1 Butters "How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
"
12 1 Butters "Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
"
12 1 Butters "Great benefit, Eric!
"
12 1 Butters "Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
"
12 1 Butters "Okay, but... what are you going to do?
"
12 1 Butters "I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
"
12 1 Butters "I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
"
12 1 Butters "Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
12 1 Butters "Wow, you really know what you're doing.
"
12 2 Butters "Man...
"
12 2 Butters "Aw, poor girl.
"
12 2 Butters "Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
"
12 2 Butters "Hokay. 
"
12 2 Butters "Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
"
12 2 Butters "Not me! I'm a squirrel!
"
12 2 Butters "I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
"
12 2 Butters "It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
"
12 2 Butters "You killed her! 
"
12 3 Butters "Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
"
12 3 Butters "Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
"
12 3 Butters "Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
"
12 3 Butters "There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
"
12 3 Butters "Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
"
12 3 Butters "Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
"
12 4 Butters "Yippie!
"
12 4 Butters "Aww, this one again?!
"
12 4 Butters "Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
"
12 4 Butters "Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?

"
12 7 Butters "We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
"
12 7 Butters "Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
"
12 7 Butters "What?! They called the cops?!

12 7 Butters "Oh my God, the police are looking for us!

"
12 14 Butters "You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
12 14 Butters "I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
"
12 14 Butters "Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
12 14 Butters "I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
12 14 Butters "I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
12 14 Butters "U-huh.  Ow.
"
12 14 Butters "What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
12 14 Butters "Hey Dad. 
"
12 14 Butters "I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
"
12 14 Butters "Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
12 14 Butters "Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
12 14 Butters "Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
12 14 Butters "I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
12 14 Butters "Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
12 14 Butters "They're putting an end to it! 
"
12 14 Butters "Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
12 14 Butters "Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
12 14 Butters "What's that, Dad?
"
12 14 Butters "Uh oh.
"
12 14 Butters "Ahh, dangit!
