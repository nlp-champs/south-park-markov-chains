9 1 Kyle "How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"
9 1 Kyle "I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
9 1 Kyle "Oo whataya mean?
"
9 1 Kyle "I know. I deserve it.
"
9 1 Kyle "You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
"
9 1 Kyle "But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"
9 1 Kyle "But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. That's right.
"
9 1 Kyle "Totally! I totally understand!
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
9 1 Kyle "No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
"
9 1 Kyle "I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
"
9 1 Kyle "But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
"
9 1 Kyle "Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
"
9 1 Kyle "But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
"
9 1 Kyle "Alright, Dad! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
"
9 1 Kyle "Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Dad, I can play! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Ow. Hm. 
"
9 1 Kyle "I got it! I got the ball. 
"
9 1 Kyle "But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
"
9 2 Kyle "Hey, let's ask them. 
"
9 2 Kyle "Wha- whataya mean?
"
9 2 Kyle "Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, we're pissed off.
"
9 2 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
9 2 Kyle "You said it!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, it's called a town.
"
9 2 Kyle "You're doing what?
"
9 2 Kyle "We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
9 2 Kyle "Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
"
9 3 Kyle "How come we never get opportunities like that?
"
9 3 Kyle "We're not talented?
"
9 3 Kyle "Probably.
"
9 3 Kyle "Why?
"
9 3 Kyle "Can I talk to you?! 
"
9 3 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yes he does!
"
9 3 Kyle "Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
9 3 Kyle "Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Welcome to the team, Token.
"
9 3 Kyle "We knew you could do it!
"
9 3 Kyle "Twenty dollars.
"
9 3 Kyle "Mister, you can't do this to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
"
9 3 Kyle "Jesus, we made it just in time! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh crap!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
"
9 3 Kyle "Aw, just forget it! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
"
9 3 Kyle "Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
"
9 3 Kyle "Let's do it Wing!
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh my God, dude!
"
9 3 Kyle "What?
"
9 3 Kyle "Get out!
"
9 3 Kyle "Woohoo! Yeah!
"
9 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"
9 3 Kyle "Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
9 3 Kyle "You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
9 3 Kyle "You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Dude, maybe we should give up!
"
9 3 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Stupid talent agents!
"
9 3 Kyle "All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
"
9 3 Kyle "They killed Kenny!
"
9 3 Kyle "She had a contract with us first! We own her!
"
9 3 Kyle "Her life belongs to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah.
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
"
9 3 Kyle "Me too.
"
9 3 Kyle "Token?
"
9 4 Kyle "That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wuh what'd I do?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny had a will?
"
9 4 Kyle "That's... really touching.
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny! You're alive!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
9 4 Kyle "That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
"
9 4 Kyle "How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"
9 4 Kyle "Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
"
9 4 Kyle "Yeah, come on! 
"
9 4 Kyle "We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
"
9 4 Kyle "You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
"
9 4 Kyle "Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
"
9 5 Kyle "This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
"
9 5 Kyle "No more boring baseball until next year!
"
9 5 Kyle "Nobody said anything about a post-season.
"
9 5 Kyle "I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
9 5 Kyle "You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
"
9 5 Kyle "You hate this game too?
"
9 5 Kyle "No, we're gonna get creamed!
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Crud! 
"
9 5 Kyle "We're so proud of you kids!
"
9 5 Kyle "What?
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
"
9 5 Kyle "I know who.
"
9 5 Kyle "There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
"
9 5 Kyle "You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw crap! 
"
9 5 Kyle "Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"
9 5 Kyle "Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
"
9 5 Kyle "Get up! You have to fight! 
"
9 6 Kyle "God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
"
9 6 Kyle "She's here!
"
9 6 Kyle "I want some!
"
9 6 Kyle "Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
"
9 6 Kyle "All right, let's eat Colonel! 
"
9 6 Kyle "The skin's the best part...
"
9 6 Kyle "You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
"
9 6 Kyle "Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"
9 6 Kyle "Yes, but he thrives on that.
"
9 6 Kyle "That sounds great!
"
9 6 Kyle "Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
"
9 6 Kyle "Thanks. 
"
9 6 Kyle "We're ignoring him.
"
9 6 Kyle "Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
"
9 6 Kyle "There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
"
9 6 Kyle "It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"
9 6 Kyle "He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
9 6 Kyle "We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
"
9 7 Kyle "Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
"
9 7 Kyle "I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
"
9 7 Kyle "Huh wuh, what's the matter?
"
9 8 Kyle "Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
"
9 8 Kyle "Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
"
9 8 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 8 Kyle "How do you know that?
"
9 8 Kyle "George Bush?
"
9 8 Kyle "Terrorists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Communists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Chinese radicals?
"
9 8 Kyle "...Cartman?
"
9 8 Kyle "Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
9 8 Kyle "How?
"
9 8 Kyle "We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
"
9 8 Kyle "Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
"
9 8 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
9 8 Kyle "What gold??
"
9 8 Kyle "No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
"
9 8 Kyle "Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
"
9 8 Kyle "Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
"
9 8 Kyle "...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
"
9 9 Kyle "What are all you guys doing here?
"
9 9 Kyle "The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
"
9 9 Kyle "The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
"
9 9 Kyle "That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
"
9 9 Kyle "Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
9 9 Kyle "Jesus, what are they doing in there?
"
9 9 Kyle "Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
"
9 9 Kyle "Can you see anything? 
"
9 9 Kyle "Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"
9 9 Kyle "I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
"
9 9 Kyle "It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
"
9 10 Kyle "Hello? Oh hey dude.
"
9 10 Kyle "Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
"
9 10 Kyle "I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
"
9 10 Kyle "Why?
"
9 10 Kyle "Who?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
"
9 10 Kyle "Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
"
9 10 Kyle "It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
"
9 10 Kyle "At who?  Heh- hang on. 
"
9 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
"
9 10 Kyle "Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, it's totally fine.
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
9 10 Kyle "Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"
9 10 Kyle "She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Impress Wendy??
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan?
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
9 10 Kyle "I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
9 10 Kyle "It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"
9 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
9 10 Kyle "Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
"
9 10 Kyle "Thanks dude! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Keep running! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Hang on! Wait! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Gays can get married? What??
"
9 10 Kyle "What did we do?
"
9 11 Kyle "What?!
"
9 11 Kyle "That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
"
9 11 Kyle "This is all a bunch of crap!
"
9 11 Kyle "It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
9 11 Kyle "Fine, I will! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"
9 11 Kyle "What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"
9 11 Kyle "We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
"
9 11 Kyle "But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
"
9 11 Kyle "I just had a couple more questions about-
"
9 11 Kyle "And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Thanks Butters
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
"
9 11 Kyle "There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey.  That's a great idea!
"
9 11 Kyle "Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
9 11 Kyle "We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"
9 11 Kyle "Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
"
9 11 Kyle "Is that an umbrella you're using?
"
9 11 Kyle "...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
"
9 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, this is going awesome.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, check it out. 
"
9 11 Kyle "We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
"
9 11 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
"
9 11 Kyle "Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
9 11 Kyle "Are you in?
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh... hey there. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Let's just... let's just walk this way. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Yeah, good idea. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
9 11 Kyle "In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh Jesus, I should have known!
"
9 11 Kyle "Cartman! I need to tell you something!
"
9 11 Kyle "Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"
9 11 Kyle "You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
"
9 12 Kyle "Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
"
9 12 Kyle "How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
"
9 12 Kyle "So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah. See ya. 
"
9 12 Kyle "Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
"
9 12 Kyle "Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
"
9 12 Kyle "Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
"
9 12 Kyle "What secret truth??
"
9 12 Kyle "I didn't know you were depressed.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, Jambu is the best! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
"
9 13 Kyle "I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
9 13 Kyle "Who said that?
"
9 13 Kyle "No way!
"
9 13 Kyle "South Park.
"
9 13 Kyle "What do you wanna talk about?
"
9 13 Kyle "Rocket ships?
"
9 13 Kyle "Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
9 13 Kyle "This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
"
9 13 Kyle "I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
"
9 13 Kyle "He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
"
9 13 Kyle "Goddammit, say something!
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
9 13 Kyle "Sick?
"
9 13 Kyle "Oh my God...
"
9 13 Kyle "That's terrible!
"
9 13 Kyle "Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
"
9 13 Kyle "The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
"
9 13 Kyle "Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
"
9 13 Kyle "Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"
9 13 Kyle "Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
"
9 13 Kyle "Stan? 
"
9 13 Kyle "Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
"
9 13 Kyle "I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
"
9 13 Kyle "You can? Awesome!
"
9 13 Kyle "Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
"
9 13 Kyle "But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
"
9 13 Kyle "They want twenty million dollars.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
9 13 Kyle "I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
"
9 13 Kyle "Okay ma, thanks! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
"
9 13 Kyle "Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
9 13 Kyle "Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
"
9 13 Kyle "Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
"
9 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 13 Kyle "You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
"
9 13 Kyle "No! Please, we have to go!
"
9 13 Kyle "But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right!!
"
9 13 Kyle "It belongs with its family!
"
9 13 Kyle "Tijuana, Mexico!
"
9 13 Kyle "You're going home, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Willzy-x, I think we're here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Come on, guys! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
"
9 13 Kyle "Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "We did it!
"
9 13 Kyle "All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
"
9 13 Kyle "I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
"
9 14 Kyle "He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Are you sure you're all right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, I think you're being followed. 
"
9 14 Kyle "No, dude, it's the police. 
"
9 14 Kyle "I think his pants are falling down.
"
9 14 Kyle "You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
"
9 1 Kyle "How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"
9 1 Kyle "I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
9 1 Kyle "Oo whataya mean?
"
9 1 Kyle "I know. I deserve it.
"
9 1 Kyle "You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
"
9 1 Kyle "But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"
9 1 Kyle "But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. That's right.
"
9 1 Kyle "Totally! I totally understand!
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
9 1 Kyle "No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
"
9 1 Kyle "I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
"
9 1 Kyle "But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
"
9 1 Kyle "Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
"
9 1 Kyle "But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
"
9 1 Kyle "Alright, Dad! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
"
9 1 Kyle "Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Dad, I can play! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Ow. Hm. 
"
9 1 Kyle "I got it! I got the ball. 
"
9 1 Kyle "But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
"
9 2 Kyle "Hey, let's ask them. 
"
9 2 Kyle "Wha- whataya mean?
"
9 2 Kyle "Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, we're pissed off.
"
9 2 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
9 2 Kyle "You said it!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, it's called a town.
"
9 2 Kyle "You're doing what?
"
9 2 Kyle "We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
9 2 Kyle "Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
"
9 3 Kyle "How come we never get opportunities like that?
"
9 3 Kyle "We're not talented?
"
9 3 Kyle "Probably.
"
9 3 Kyle "Why?
"
9 3 Kyle "Can I talk to you?! 
"
9 3 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yes he does!
"
9 3 Kyle "Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
9 3 Kyle "Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Welcome to the team, Token.
"
9 3 Kyle "We knew you could do it!
"
9 3 Kyle "Twenty dollars.
"
9 3 Kyle "Mister, you can't do this to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
"
9 3 Kyle "Jesus, we made it just in time! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh crap!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
"
9 3 Kyle "Aw, just forget it! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
"
9 3 Kyle "Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
"
9 3 Kyle "Let's do it Wing!
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh my God, dude!
"
9 3 Kyle "What?
"
9 3 Kyle "Get out!
"
9 3 Kyle "Woohoo! Yeah!
"
9 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"
9 3 Kyle "Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
9 3 Kyle "You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
9 3 Kyle "You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Dude, maybe we should give up!
"
9 3 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Stupid talent agents!
"
9 3 Kyle "All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
"
9 3 Kyle "They killed Kenny!
"
9 3 Kyle "She had a contract with us first! We own her!
"
9 3 Kyle "Her life belongs to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah.
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
"
9 3 Kyle "Me too.
"
9 3 Kyle "Token?
"
9 4 Kyle "That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wuh what'd I do?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny had a will?
"
9 4 Kyle "That's... really touching.
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny! You're alive!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
9 4 Kyle "That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
"
9 4 Kyle "How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"
9 4 Kyle "Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
"
9 4 Kyle "Yeah, come on! 
"
9 4 Kyle "We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
"
9 4 Kyle "You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
"
9 4 Kyle "Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
"
9 5 Kyle "This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
"
9 5 Kyle "No more boring baseball until next year!
"
9 5 Kyle "Nobody said anything about a post-season.
"
9 5 Kyle "I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
9 5 Kyle "You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
"
9 5 Kyle "You hate this game too?
"
9 5 Kyle "No, we're gonna get creamed!
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Crud! 
"
9 5 Kyle "We're so proud of you kids!
"
9 5 Kyle "What?
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
"
9 5 Kyle "I know who.
"
9 5 Kyle "There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
"
9 5 Kyle "You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw crap! 
"
9 5 Kyle "Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"
9 5 Kyle "Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
"
9 5 Kyle "Get up! You have to fight! 
"
9 6 Kyle "God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
"
9 6 Kyle "She's here!
"
9 6 Kyle "I want some!
"
9 6 Kyle "Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
"
9 6 Kyle "All right, let's eat Colonel! 
"
9 6 Kyle "The skin's the best part...
"
9 6 Kyle "You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
"
9 6 Kyle "Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"
9 6 Kyle "Yes, but he thrives on that.
"
9 6 Kyle "That sounds great!
"
9 6 Kyle "Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
"
9 6 Kyle "Thanks. 
"
9 6 Kyle "We're ignoring him.
"
9 6 Kyle "Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
"
9 6 Kyle "There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
"
9 6 Kyle "It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"
9 6 Kyle "He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
9 6 Kyle "We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
"
9 7 Kyle "Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
"
9 7 Kyle "I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
"
9 7 Kyle "Huh wuh, what's the matter?
"
9 8 Kyle "Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
"
9 8 Kyle "Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
"
9 8 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 8 Kyle "How do you know that?
"
9 8 Kyle "George Bush?
"
9 8 Kyle "Terrorists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Communists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Chinese radicals?
"
9 8 Kyle "...Cartman?
"
9 8 Kyle "Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
9 8 Kyle "How?
"
9 8 Kyle "We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
"
9 8 Kyle "Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
"
9 8 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
9 8 Kyle "What gold??
"
9 8 Kyle "No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
"
9 8 Kyle "Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
"
9 8 Kyle "Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
"
9 8 Kyle "...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
"
9 9 Kyle "What are all you guys doing here?
"
9 9 Kyle "The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
"
9 9 Kyle "The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
"
9 9 Kyle "That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
"
9 9 Kyle "Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
9 9 Kyle "Jesus, what are they doing in there?
"
9 9 Kyle "Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
"
9 9 Kyle "Can you see anything? 
"
9 9 Kyle "Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"
9 9 Kyle "I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
"
9 9 Kyle "It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
"
9 10 Kyle "Hello? Oh hey dude.
"
9 10 Kyle "Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
"
9 10 Kyle "I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
"
9 10 Kyle "Why?
"
9 10 Kyle "Who?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
"
9 10 Kyle "Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
"
9 10 Kyle "It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
"
9 10 Kyle "At who?  Heh- hang on. 
"
9 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
"
9 10 Kyle "Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, it's totally fine.
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
9 10 Kyle "Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"
9 10 Kyle "She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Impress Wendy??
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan?
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
9 10 Kyle "I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
9 10 Kyle "It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"
9 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
9 10 Kyle "Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
"
9 10 Kyle "Thanks dude! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Keep running! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Hang on! Wait! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Gays can get married? What??
"
9 10 Kyle "What did we do?
"
9 11 Kyle "What?!
"
9 11 Kyle "That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
"
9 11 Kyle "This is all a bunch of crap!
"
9 11 Kyle "It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
9 11 Kyle "Fine, I will! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"
9 11 Kyle "What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"
9 11 Kyle "We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
"
9 11 Kyle "But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
"
9 11 Kyle "I just had a couple more questions about-
"
9 11 Kyle "And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Thanks Butters
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
"
9 11 Kyle "There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey.  That's a great idea!
"
9 11 Kyle "Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
9 11 Kyle "We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"
9 11 Kyle "Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
"
9 11 Kyle "Is that an umbrella you're using?
"
9 11 Kyle "...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
"
9 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, this is going awesome.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, check it out. 
"
9 11 Kyle "We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
"
9 11 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
"
9 11 Kyle "Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
9 11 Kyle "Are you in?
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh... hey there. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Let's just... let's just walk this way. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Yeah, good idea. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
9 11 Kyle "In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh Jesus, I should have known!
"
9 11 Kyle "Cartman! I need to tell you something!
"
9 11 Kyle "Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"
9 11 Kyle "You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
"
9 12 Kyle "Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
"
9 12 Kyle "How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
"
9 12 Kyle "So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah. See ya. 
"
9 12 Kyle "Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
"
9 12 Kyle "Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
"
9 12 Kyle "Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
"
9 12 Kyle "What secret truth??
"
9 12 Kyle "I didn't know you were depressed.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, Jambu is the best! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
"
9 13 Kyle "I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
9 13 Kyle "Who said that?
"
9 13 Kyle "No way!
"
9 13 Kyle "South Park.
"
9 13 Kyle "What do you wanna talk about?
"
9 13 Kyle "Rocket ships?
"
9 13 Kyle "Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
9 13 Kyle "This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
"
9 13 Kyle "I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
"
9 13 Kyle "He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
"
9 13 Kyle "Goddammit, say something!
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
9 13 Kyle "Sick?
"
9 13 Kyle "Oh my God...
"
9 13 Kyle "That's terrible!
"
9 13 Kyle "Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
"
9 13 Kyle "The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
"
9 13 Kyle "Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
"
9 13 Kyle "Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"
9 13 Kyle "Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
"
9 13 Kyle "Stan? 
"
9 13 Kyle "Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
"
9 13 Kyle "I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
"
9 13 Kyle "You can? Awesome!
"
9 13 Kyle "Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
"
9 13 Kyle "But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
"
9 13 Kyle "They want twenty million dollars.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
9 13 Kyle "I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
"
9 13 Kyle "Okay ma, thanks! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
"
9 13 Kyle "Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
9 13 Kyle "Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
"
9 13 Kyle "Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
"
9 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 13 Kyle "You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
"
9 13 Kyle "No! Please, we have to go!
"
9 13 Kyle "But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right!!
"
9 13 Kyle "It belongs with its family!
"
9 13 Kyle "Tijuana, Mexico!
"
9 13 Kyle "You're going home, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Willzy-x, I think we're here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Come on, guys! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
"
9 13 Kyle "Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "We did it!
"
9 13 Kyle "All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
"
9 13 Kyle "I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
"
9 14 Kyle "He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Are you sure you're all right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, I think you're being followed. 
"
9 14 Kyle "No, dude, it's the police. 
"
9 14 Kyle "I think his pants are falling down.
"
9 14 Kyle "You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
"
9 1 Kyle "How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"
9 1 Kyle "I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
9 1 Kyle "Oo whataya mean?
"
9 1 Kyle "I know. I deserve it.
"
9 1 Kyle "You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
"
9 1 Kyle "But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"
9 1 Kyle "But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. That's right.
"
9 1 Kyle "Totally! I totally understand!
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
9 1 Kyle "No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
"
9 1 Kyle "I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
"
9 1 Kyle "But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
9 1 Kyle "Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
"
9 1 Kyle "Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
"
9 1 Kyle "But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
"
9 1 Kyle "Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
"
9 1 Kyle "Alright, Dad! 
"
9 1 Kyle "Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
"
9 1 Kyle "Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Dad, I can play! 
"
9 1 Kyle "I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
"
9 1 Kyle "All right!  Ow. Hm. 
"
9 1 Kyle "I got it! I got the ball. 
"
9 1 Kyle "But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
"
9 2 Kyle "Hey, let's ask them. 
"
9 2 Kyle "Wha- whataya mean?
"
9 2 Kyle "Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, we're pissed off.
"
9 2 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
9 2 Kyle "You said it!
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
"
9 2 Kyle "Yeah, it's called a town.
"
9 2 Kyle "You're doing what?
"
9 2 Kyle "We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
9 2 Kyle "Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
"
9 3 Kyle "How come we never get opportunities like that?
"
9 3 Kyle "We're not talented?
"
9 3 Kyle "Probably.
"
9 3 Kyle "Why?
"
9 3 Kyle "Can I talk to you?! 
"
9 3 Kyle "What the hell are you doing?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yes he does!
"
9 3 Kyle "Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
9 3 Kyle "Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Welcome to the team, Token.
"
9 3 Kyle "We knew you could do it!
"
9 3 Kyle "Twenty dollars.
"
9 3 Kyle "Mister, you can't do this to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"
9 3 Kyle "Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
"
9 3 Kyle "Jesus, we made it just in time! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh crap!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
"
9 3 Kyle "Aw, just forget it! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
9 3 Kyle "Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
"
9 3 Kyle "Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
"
9 3 Kyle "Let's do it Wing!
"
9 3 Kyle "Oh my God, dude!
"
9 3 Kyle "What?
"
9 3 Kyle "Get out!
"
9 3 Kyle "Woohoo! Yeah!
"
9 3 Kyle "What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"
9 3 Kyle "Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
9 3 Kyle "You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
9 3 Kyle "You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Dude, maybe we should give up!
"
9 3 Kyle "Cartman! 
"
9 3 Kyle "Wing?
"
9 3 Kyle "Stupid talent agents!
"
9 3 Kyle "All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
"
9 3 Kyle "They killed Kenny!
"
9 3 Kyle "She had a contract with us first! We own her!
"
9 3 Kyle "Her life belongs to us!
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah.
"
9 3 Kyle "Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
"
9 3 Kyle "Me too.
"
9 3 Kyle "Token?
"
9 4 Kyle "That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wuh what'd I do?
"
9 4 Kyle "Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny had a will?
"
9 4 Kyle "That's... really touching.
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
9 4 Kyle "Kenny! You're alive!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
"
9 4 Kyle "He did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Did not!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman!
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
9 4 Kyle "That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
"
9 4 Kyle "How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"
9 4 Kyle "Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
"
9 4 Kyle "Yeah, come on! 
"
9 4 Kyle "We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
"
9 4 Kyle "You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
"
9 4 Kyle "Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
"
9 4 Kyle "Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
"
9 4 Kyle "Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
"
9 5 Kyle "This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
"
9 5 Kyle "No more boring baseball until next year!
"
9 5 Kyle "Nobody said anything about a post-season.
"
9 5 Kyle "I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
9 5 Kyle "You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
"
9 5 Kyle "You hate this game too?
"
9 5 Kyle "No, we're gonna get creamed!
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Crud! 
"
9 5 Kyle "We're so proud of you kids!
"
9 5 Kyle "What?
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
"
9 5 Kyle "I know who.
"
9 5 Kyle "There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
9 5 Kyle "Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
"
9 5 Kyle "You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
"
9 5 Kyle "Aw crap! 
"
9 5 Kyle "Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"
9 5 Kyle "Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
"
9 5 Kyle "Get up! You have to fight! 
"
9 6 Kyle "God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
"
9 6 Kyle "She's here!
"
9 6 Kyle "I want some!
"
9 6 Kyle "Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
"
9 6 Kyle "All right, let's eat Colonel! 
"
9 6 Kyle "The skin's the best part...
"
9 6 Kyle "You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
"
9 6 Kyle "Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"
9 6 Kyle "Yes, but he thrives on that.
"
9 6 Kyle "That sounds great!
"
9 6 Kyle "Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
"
9 6 Kyle "Thanks. 
"
9 6 Kyle "We're ignoring him.
"
9 6 Kyle "Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
"
9 6 Kyle "There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
"
9 6 Kyle "It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"
9 6 Kyle "He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
9 6 Kyle "We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
"
9 7 Kyle "Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
"
9 7 Kyle "I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
"
9 7 Kyle "Huh wuh, what's the matter?
"
9 8 Kyle "Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
"
9 8 Kyle "Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
"
9 8 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 8 Kyle "How do you know that?
"
9 8 Kyle "George Bush?
"
9 8 Kyle "Terrorists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Communists?
"
9 8 Kyle "Chinese radicals?
"
9 8 Kyle "...Cartman?
"
9 8 Kyle "Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
9 8 Kyle "How?
"
9 8 Kyle "We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"
9 8 Kyle "Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
"
9 8 Kyle "Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
"
9 8 Kyle "What are you doing?
"
9 8 Kyle "What gold??
"
9 8 Kyle "No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
"
9 8 Kyle "Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"
9 8 Kyle "Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
"
9 8 Kyle "Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
"
9 8 Kyle "...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
"
9 9 Kyle "What are all you guys doing here?
"
9 9 Kyle "The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
"
9 9 Kyle "The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
"
9 9 Kyle "That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
"
9 9 Kyle "Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
9 9 Kyle "Jesus, what are they doing in there?
"
9 9 Kyle "Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
"
9 9 Kyle "Can you see anything? 
"
9 9 Kyle "Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"
9 9 Kyle "I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
"
9 9 Kyle "It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
"
9 10 Kyle "Hello? Oh hey dude.
"
9 10 Kyle "Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
"
9 10 Kyle "I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
"
9 10 Kyle "Why?
"
9 10 Kyle "Who?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
"
9 10 Kyle "Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
"
9 10 Kyle "It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
"
9 10 Kyle "At who?  Heh- hang on. 
"
9 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
"
9 10 Kyle "Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
"
9 10 Kyle "Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, it's totally fine.
"
9 10 Kyle "Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
9 10 Kyle "Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"
9 10 Kyle "She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
"
9 10 Kyle "Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Impress Wendy??
"
9 10 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about?!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan?
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
9 10 Kyle "I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
9 10 Kyle "It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
"
9 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
9 10 Kyle "Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"
9 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
9 10 Kyle "Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
"
9 10 Kyle "Thanks dude! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Keep running! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Hang on! Wait! 
"
9 10 Kyle "Gays can get married? What??
"
9 10 Kyle "What did we do?
"
9 11 Kyle "What?!
"
9 11 Kyle "That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
"
9 11 Kyle "This is all a bunch of crap!
"
9 11 Kyle "It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
9 11 Kyle "Fine, I will! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"
9 11 Kyle "What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"
9 11 Kyle "We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
"
9 11 Kyle "But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
"
9 11 Kyle "I just had a couple more questions about-
"
9 11 Kyle "And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Thanks Butters
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
"
9 11 Kyle "There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
"
9 11 Kyle "Hey.  That's a great idea!
"
9 11 Kyle "Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
9 11 Kyle "We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"
9 11 Kyle "Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
"
9 11 Kyle "Is that an umbrella you're using?
"
9 11 Kyle "...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
"
9 11 Kyle "Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, this is going awesome.
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, check it out. 
"
9 11 Kyle "We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
"
9 11 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
9 11 Kyle "Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
"
9 11 Kyle "Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
9 11 Kyle "Are you in?
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh... hey there. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Let's just... let's just walk this way. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Yeah, good idea. 
"
9 11 Kyle "Kenny!
"
9 11 Kyle "In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
"
9 11 Kyle "Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
9 11 Kyle "Oh Jesus, I should have known!
"
9 11 Kyle "Cartman! I need to tell you something!
"
9 11 Kyle "Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"
9 11 Kyle "You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
"
9 12 Kyle "Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
"
9 12 Kyle "How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
"
9 12 Kyle "So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
"
9 12 Kyle "Yeah. See ya. 
"
9 12 Kyle "Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
"
9 12 Kyle "Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
"
9 12 Kyle "Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
"
9 12 Kyle "What secret truth??
"
9 12 Kyle "I didn't know you were depressed.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, Jambu is the best! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
"
9 13 Kyle "I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
9 13 Kyle "Who said that?
"
9 13 Kyle "No way!
"
9 13 Kyle "South Park.
"
9 13 Kyle "What do you wanna talk about?
"
9 13 Kyle "Rocket ships?
"
9 13 Kyle "Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
9 13 Kyle "This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
9 13 Kyle "Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
"
9 13 Kyle "I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
"
9 13 Kyle "He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
"
9 13 Kyle "Goddammit, say something!
"
9 13 Kyle "Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
9 13 Kyle "Sick?
"
9 13 Kyle "Oh my God...
"
9 13 Kyle "That's terrible!
"
9 13 Kyle "Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
"
9 13 Kyle "The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
"
9 13 Kyle "Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
"
9 13 Kyle "Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"
9 13 Kyle "Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
"
9 13 Kyle "Stan? 
"
9 13 Kyle "Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
"
9 13 Kyle "I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
"
9 13 Kyle "You can? Awesome!
"
9 13 Kyle "Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
"
9 13 Kyle "But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
"
9 13 Kyle "They want twenty million dollars.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
9 13 Kyle "I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
"
9 13 Kyle "Okay ma, thanks! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
"
9 13 Kyle "Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
9 13 Kyle "Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
"
9 13 Kyle "Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
"
9 13 Kyle "Huh?
"
9 13 Kyle "You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
"
9 13 Kyle "No! Please, we have to go!
"
9 13 Kyle "But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
9 13 Kyle "All right!!
"
9 13 Kyle "It belongs with its family!
"
9 13 Kyle "Tijuana, Mexico!
"
9 13 Kyle "You're going home, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Willzy-x, I think we're here.
"
9 13 Kyle "Come on, guys! 
"
9 13 Kyle "Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
"
9 13 Kyle "Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 
"
9 13 Kyle "We did it!
"
9 13 Kyle "All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
"
9 13 Kyle "I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
"
9 14 Kyle "He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Are you sure you're all right?
"
9 14 Kyle "Dude, I think you're being followed. 
"
9 14 Kyle "No, dude, it's the police. 
"
9 14 Kyle "I think his pants are falling down.
"
9 14 Kyle "You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
"
