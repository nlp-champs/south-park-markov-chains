15 1 Cartman "Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
15 1 Cartman "What?
"
15 1 Cartman "Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
15 1 Cartman "No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
15 1 Cartman "I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
"
15 1 Cartman "YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
"
15 1 Cartman "I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
15 1 Cartman "Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
15 1 Cartman "Toshiba Handibook??
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
15 1 Cartman "You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "But I told you I was sorry.
"
15 1 Cartman "I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
"
15 1 Cartman "Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
15 1 Cartman "Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
15 1 Cartman "Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
15 1 Cartman "At Best Buy.
"
15 1 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes!
"
15 1 Cartman "No!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Booooooo!
"
15 1 Cartman "She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
15 1 Cartman "You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
15 1 Cartman "An iPad??? 
"
15 1 Cartman "Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
15 1 Cartman "What?! Hey, that's mine!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
15 2 Cartman "What's this?
"
15 2 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
"
15 2 Cartman "Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
15 2 Cartman "Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
"
15 2 Cartman "Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Well, I tried.
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
15 2 Cartman "He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
15 2 Cartman "Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
15 2 Cartman "Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
15 2 Cartman "It's kind of funny, you guys.
"
15 2 Cartman "Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
15 2 Cartman "Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
15 2 Cartman "Paradox...
"
15 2 Cartman "Or will there be?
"
15 3 Cartman "My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
"
15 4 Cartman "Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
"
15 4 Cartman "I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
15 4 Cartman "Go look for yourselves!!
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
15 4 Cartman "No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
"
15 4 Cartman "They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
15 4 Cartman "Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
"
15 4 Cartman "Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
"
15 4 Cartman "What, Kyle?
"
15 4 Cartman "I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, it's pretty good.
"
15 4 Cartman "Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, Goddamnit!
"
15 4 Cartman "Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
"
15 4 Cartman "For what?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
15 4 Cartman "You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
15 4 Cartman "What?
"
15 4 Cartman "Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't know! Why would you?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
15 4 Cartman "Fuck you! No I don't!
"
15 4 Cartman "Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why the fuck am I here?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, that's cool.
"
15 4 Cartman "My penis is 13 inches long.
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah dude!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
15 4 Cartman "Burn it down, dude! 
"
15 4 Cartman "The Jews!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, and fuck Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait, what?
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm still fucking angry!
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ah, crap! 
"
15 5 Cartman "Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
15 5 Cartman "What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
"
15 5 Cartman "Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
"
15 5 Cartman "Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
15 5 Cartman "What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
15 5 Cartman "Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
15 5 Cartman "After you. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Come on. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
15 5 Cartman "It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
15 5 Cartman "Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
15 5 Cartman "We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
15 5 Cartman "You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
"
15 5 Cartman "Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Betsy MacIntosh?
"
15 5 Cartman "We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
15 5 Cartman "We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
15 5 Cartman "And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
15 5 Cartman "Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
"
15 5 Cartman "Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
15 5 Cartman "Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
"
15 5 Cartman "Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
15 5 Cartman "Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
15 5 Cartman "Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
"
15 5 Cartman "They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
15 5 Cartman "What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
15 5 Cartman "A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
15 5 Cartman "Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
15 5 Cartman "My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
"
15 5 Cartman "You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
15 5 Cartman "Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
15 5 Cartman "I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
15 5 Cartman "But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
15 5 Cartman "You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
15 5 Cartman "How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
15 5 Cartman "How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
15 5 Cartman "Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
15 5 Cartman "Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
15 5 Cartman "...What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
15 5 Cartman "This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
"
15 5 Cartman "What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Vunter Slash?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
15 5 Cartman "Are you fucking serious? 
"
15 5 Cartman "You knew about this??
"
15 5 Cartman "I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
15 5 Cartman "I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
15 5 Cartman "He is real, you guys. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
15 7 Cartman "Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!
"
15 7 Cartman "What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
15 7 Cartman "Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
15 7 Cartman "Turn it off dude!
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
15 7 Cartman "He's lying, dude. Hit X
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
15 7 Cartman "Look like ice cream to me.
"
15 7 Cartman "...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
15 7 Cartman "That looks pretty good.
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan, knock it off!
"
15 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
15 7 Cartman "Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
15 8 Cartman "Yep!
"
15 8 Cartman "Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait what?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
"
15 8 Cartman "You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
15 8 Cartman "That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
15 8 Cartman "Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
15 8 Cartman "Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
"
15 8 Cartman "I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
15 8 Cartman "A what??
"
15 8 Cartman "Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
"
15 8 Cartman "What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
15 8 Cartman "Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
15 8 Cartman "I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
15 8 Cartman "Really?
"
15 8 Cartman "Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
15 8 Cartman "Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
15 8 Cartman "There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
15 8 Cartman "How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
"
15 8 Cartman "Nice!
"
15 8 Cartman "It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
15 8 Cartman "We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
15 8 Cartman "Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
15 9 Cartman "Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
"
15 9 Cartman "Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
15 9 Cartman "He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
"
15 9 Cartman "Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
15 9 Cartman "Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
15 9 Cartman "Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh God! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
"
15 9 Cartman "At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
"
15 9 Cartman "Where is Butters?
"
15 9 Cartman "All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
15 9 Cartman "Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh dude. Sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
15 9 Cartman "No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
15 9 Cartman "Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh no you don't! 
"
15 9 Cartman "That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No you won't Butters!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey!
"
15 9 Cartman "¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
15 9 Cartman "A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
15 10 Cartman "YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
15 10 Cartman "You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
"
15 10 Cartman "He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
15 10 Cartman "Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, he killed himself.
"
15 10 Cartman "Hey! Whoooa.
"
15 10 Cartman "'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
"
15 10 Cartman "You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
15 10 Cartman "Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
15 10 Cartman "Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
15 10 Cartman "You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
15 10 Cartman "Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
15 10 Cartman "So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
15 10 Cartman "I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
15 10 Cartman "I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
15 10 Cartman "You okay, Jenny?
"
15 10 Cartman "Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
15 10 Cartman "Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
15 10 Cartman "WAY worse!
"
15 10 Cartman "Alright, kewl.
"
15 10 Cartman "You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
"
15 10 Cartman "Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
15 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
15 10 Cartman "No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
15 10 Cartman "That. Was. Amazing.
"
15 10 Cartman "Boy, I say.
"
15 10 Cartman "It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
15 10 Cartman "Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
"
15 10 Cartman "I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
15 11 Cartman "Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
15 12 Cartman "Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
15 12 Cartman "Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
15 12 Cartman "Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
15 12 Cartman "Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
15 12 Cartman "Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
15 12 Cartman "Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
15 12 Cartman "What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Mom, have you been here all day?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
15 12 Cartman "No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
"
15 12 Cartman "Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly bu-what?
"
15 12 Cartman "Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
15 12 Cartman "Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
"
15 12 Cartman "Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
"
15 12 Cartman "That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
15 12 Cartman "So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
15 12 Cartman "What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
15 12 Cartman "Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
15 12 Cartman "This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
15 12 Cartman "Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
15 12 Cartman "Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
"
15 12 Cartman "Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
15 12 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
15 12 Cartman "I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh sure!
"
15 12 Cartman "Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
15 12 Cartman "HAAAAGH! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who did this to you?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
15 12 Cartman "AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
15 12 Cartman "...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
15 12 Cartman "They were your FRIENDS!
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
"
15 12 Cartman "There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
15 12 Cartman "Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
"
15 12 Cartman "Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
15 13 Cartman "Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
15 13 Cartman "This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
"
15 13 Cartman "Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
15 13 Cartman "Uh-huh??
"
15 13 Cartman "Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
15 13 Cartman "See what I mean, you guys? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
15 13 Cartman "Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh no. Oh NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys have stuffing?!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
15 13 Cartman "No!
"
15 13 Cartman "NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
15 13 Cartman "Uhhh??
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
15 14 Cartman "Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
15 14 Cartman "Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
15 14 Cartman "Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
15 14 Cartman "This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Eh yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "Heh heh, yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "What?
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
15 14 Cartman "That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
15 14 Cartman "Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
15 14 Cartman "You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
15 14 Cartman "We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
15 14 Cartman "Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
15 14 Cartman "IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
15 14 Cartman "My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
15 14 Cartman "What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, yeah.
"
15 14 Cartman "That's right.
"
15 14 Cartman "Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
"
15 14 Cartman "A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
15 14 Cartman "How?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
15 14 Cartman "Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
15 14 Cartman "What??  Greeley?
"
15 14 Cartman "What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
15 14 Cartman "You're my new mom?
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
15 14 Cartman "Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
15 14 Cartman "You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Really?
"
15 14 Cartman "YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
15 14 Cartman "I wasn't making fun of anybody.
"
15 14 Cartman "I was just teasing.
"
15 14 Cartman "My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
15 14 Cartman "Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
15 14 Cartman "Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it.
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it!
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
15 14 Cartman "There he is, there's my buddy.
"
15 14 Cartman "Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
15 14 Cartman "Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""

15 1 Cartman "Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
15 1 Cartman "What?
"
15 1 Cartman "Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
15 1 Cartman "No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
15 1 Cartman "I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
"
15 1 Cartman "YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
"
15 1 Cartman "I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
15 1 Cartman "Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
15 1 Cartman "Toshiba Handibook??
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
15 1 Cartman "You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "But I told you I was sorry.
"
15 1 Cartman "I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
"
15 1 Cartman "Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
15 1 Cartman "Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
15 1 Cartman "Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
15 1 Cartman "At Best Buy.
"
15 1 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes!
"
15 1 Cartman "No!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Booooooo!
"
15 1 Cartman "She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
15 1 Cartman "You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
15 1 Cartman "An iPad??? 
"
15 1 Cartman "Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
15 1 Cartman "What?! Hey, that's mine!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
15 2 Cartman "What's this?
"
15 2 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
"
15 2 Cartman "Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
15 2 Cartman "Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
"
15 2 Cartman "Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Well, I tried.
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
15 2 Cartman "He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
15 2 Cartman "Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
15 2 Cartman "Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
15 2 Cartman "It's kind of funny, you guys.
"
15 2 Cartman "Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
15 2 Cartman "Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
15 2 Cartman "Paradox...
"
15 2 Cartman "Or will there be?
"
15 3 Cartman "My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
"
15 4 Cartman "Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
"
15 4 Cartman "I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
15 4 Cartman "Go look for yourselves!!
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
15 4 Cartman "No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
"
15 4 Cartman "They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
15 4 Cartman "Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
"
15 4 Cartman "Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
"
15 4 Cartman "What, Kyle?
"
15 4 Cartman "I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, it's pretty good.
"
15 4 Cartman "Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, Goddamnit!
"
15 4 Cartman "Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
"
15 4 Cartman "For what?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
15 4 Cartman "You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
15 4 Cartman "What?
"
15 4 Cartman "Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't know! Why would you?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
15 4 Cartman "Fuck you! No I don't!
"
15 4 Cartman "Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why the fuck am I here?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, that's cool.
"
15 4 Cartman "My penis is 13 inches long.
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah dude!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
15 4 Cartman "Burn it down, dude! 
"
15 4 Cartman "The Jews!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, and fuck Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait, what?
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm still fucking angry!
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ah, crap! 
"
15 5 Cartman "Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
15 5 Cartman "What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
"
15 5 Cartman "Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
"
15 5 Cartman "Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
15 5 Cartman "What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
15 5 Cartman "Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
15 5 Cartman "After you. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Come on. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
15 5 Cartman "It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
15 5 Cartman "Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
15 5 Cartman "We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
15 5 Cartman "You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
"
15 5 Cartman "Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Betsy MacIntosh?
"
15 5 Cartman "We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
15 5 Cartman "We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
15 5 Cartman "And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
15 5 Cartman "Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
"
15 5 Cartman "Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
15 5 Cartman "Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
"
15 5 Cartman "Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
15 5 Cartman "Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
15 5 Cartman "Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
"
15 5 Cartman "They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
15 5 Cartman "What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
15 5 Cartman "A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
15 5 Cartman "Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
15 5 Cartman "My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
"
15 5 Cartman "You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
15 5 Cartman "Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
15 5 Cartman "I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
15 5 Cartman "But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
15 5 Cartman "You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
15 5 Cartman "How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
15 5 Cartman "How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
15 5 Cartman "Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
15 5 Cartman "Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
15 5 Cartman "...What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
15 5 Cartman "This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
"
15 5 Cartman "What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Vunter Slash?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
15 5 Cartman "Are you fucking serious? 
"
15 5 Cartman "You knew about this??
"
15 5 Cartman "I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
15 5 Cartman "I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
15 5 Cartman "He is real, you guys. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
15 7 Cartman "Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!
"
15 7 Cartman "What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
15 7 Cartman "Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
15 7 Cartman "Turn it off dude!
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
15 7 Cartman "He's lying, dude. Hit X
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
15 7 Cartman "Look like ice cream to me.
"
15 7 Cartman "...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
15 7 Cartman "That looks pretty good.
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan, knock it off!
"
15 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
15 7 Cartman "Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
15 8 Cartman "Yep!
"
15 8 Cartman "Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait what?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
"
15 8 Cartman "You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
15 8 Cartman "That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
15 8 Cartman "Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
15 8 Cartman "Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
"
15 8 Cartman "I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
15 8 Cartman "A what??
"
15 8 Cartman "Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
"
15 8 Cartman "What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
15 8 Cartman "Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
15 8 Cartman "I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
15 8 Cartman "Really?
"
15 8 Cartman "Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
15 8 Cartman "Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
15 8 Cartman "There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
15 8 Cartman "How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
"
15 8 Cartman "Nice!
"
15 8 Cartman "It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
15 8 Cartman "We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
15 8 Cartman "Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
15 9 Cartman "Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
"
15 9 Cartman "Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
15 9 Cartman "He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
"
15 9 Cartman "Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
15 9 Cartman "Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
15 9 Cartman "Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh God! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
"
15 9 Cartman "At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
"
15 9 Cartman "Where is Butters?
"
15 9 Cartman "All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
15 9 Cartman "Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh dude. Sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
15 9 Cartman "No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
15 9 Cartman "Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh no you don't! 
"
15 9 Cartman "That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No you won't Butters!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey!
"
15 9 Cartman "¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
15 9 Cartman "A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
15 10 Cartman "YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
15 10 Cartman "You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
"
15 10 Cartman "He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
15 10 Cartman "Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, he killed himself.
"
15 10 Cartman "Hey! Whoooa.
"
15 10 Cartman "'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
"
15 10 Cartman "You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
15 10 Cartman "Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
15 10 Cartman "Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
15 10 Cartman "You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
15 10 Cartman "Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
15 10 Cartman "So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
15 10 Cartman "I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
15 10 Cartman "I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
15 10 Cartman "You okay, Jenny?
"
15 10 Cartman "Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
15 10 Cartman "Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
15 10 Cartman "WAY worse!
"
15 10 Cartman "Alright, kewl.
"
15 10 Cartman "You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
"
15 10 Cartman "Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
15 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
15 10 Cartman "No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
15 10 Cartman "That. Was. Amazing.
"
15 10 Cartman "Boy, I say.
"
15 10 Cartman "It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
15 10 Cartman "Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
"
15 10 Cartman "I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
15 11 Cartman "Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
15 12 Cartman "Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
15 12 Cartman "Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
15 12 Cartman "Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
15 12 Cartman "Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
15 12 Cartman "Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
15 12 Cartman "Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
15 12 Cartman "What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Mom, have you been here all day?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
15 12 Cartman "No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
"
15 12 Cartman "Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly bu-what?
"
15 12 Cartman "Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
15 12 Cartman "Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
"
15 12 Cartman "Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
"
15 12 Cartman "That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
15 12 Cartman "So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
15 12 Cartman "What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
15 12 Cartman "Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
15 12 Cartman "This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
15 12 Cartman "Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
15 12 Cartman "Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
"
15 12 Cartman "Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
15 12 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
15 12 Cartman "I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh sure!
"
15 12 Cartman "Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
15 12 Cartman "HAAAAGH! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who did this to you?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
15 12 Cartman "AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
15 12 Cartman "...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
15 12 Cartman "They were your FRIENDS!
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
"
15 12 Cartman "There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
15 12 Cartman "Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
"
15 12 Cartman "Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
15 13 Cartman "Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
15 13 Cartman "This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
"
15 13 Cartman "Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
15 13 Cartman "Uh-huh??
"
15 13 Cartman "Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
15 13 Cartman "See what I mean, you guys? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
15 13 Cartman "Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh no. Oh NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys have stuffing?!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
15 13 Cartman "No!
"
15 13 Cartman "NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
15 13 Cartman "Uhhh??
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
15 14 Cartman "Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
15 14 Cartman "Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
15 14 Cartman "Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
15 14 Cartman "This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Eh yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "Heh heh, yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "What?
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
15 14 Cartman "That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
15 14 Cartman "Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
15 14 Cartman "You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
15 14 Cartman "We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
15 14 Cartman "Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
15 14 Cartman "IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
15 14 Cartman "My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
15 14 Cartman "What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, yeah.
"
15 14 Cartman "That's right.
"
15 14 Cartman "Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
"
15 14 Cartman "A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
15 14 Cartman "How?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
15 14 Cartman "Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
15 14 Cartman "What??  Greeley?
"
15 14 Cartman "What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
15 14 Cartman "You're my new mom?
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
15 14 Cartman "Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
15 14 Cartman "You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Really?
"
15 14 Cartman "YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
15 14 Cartman "I wasn't making fun of anybody.
"
15 14 Cartman "I was just teasing.
"
15 14 Cartman "My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
15 14 Cartman "Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
15 14 Cartman "Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it.
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it!
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
15 14 Cartman "There he is, there's my buddy.
"
15 14 Cartman "Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
15 14 Cartman "Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""

15 1 Cartman "Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
15 1 Cartman "What?
"
15 1 Cartman "Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
15 1 Cartman "No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
15 1 Cartman "I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
"
15 1 Cartman "YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
"
15 1 Cartman "I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
15 1 Cartman "Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
15 1 Cartman "Toshiba Handibook??
"
15 1 Cartman "Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
15 1 Cartman "You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
"
15 1 Cartman "But I told you I was sorry.
"
15 1 Cartman "I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
"
15 1 Cartman "Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
15 1 Cartman "Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
15 1 Cartman "Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
15 1 Cartman "At Best Buy.
"
15 1 Cartman "Uh huh.
"
15 1 Cartman "Yes!
"
15 1 Cartman "No!
"
15 1 Cartman "Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
15 1 Cartman "Booooooo!
"
15 1 Cartman "She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
15 1 Cartman "You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
15 1 Cartman "An iPad??? 
"
15 1 Cartman "Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
15 1 Cartman "What?! Hey, that's mine!
"
15 1 Cartman "Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
15 2 Cartman "What's this?
"
15 2 Cartman "Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
"
15 2 Cartman "Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
15 2 Cartman "Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
"
15 2 Cartman "Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
15 2 Cartman "Well, I tried.
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
15 2 Cartman "He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
15 2 Cartman "Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
15 2 Cartman "Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
15 2 Cartman "Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
15 2 Cartman "It's kind of funny, you guys.
"
15 2 Cartman "Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
15 2 Cartman "Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
15 2 Cartman "Paradox...
"
15 2 Cartman "Or will there be?
"
15 3 Cartman "My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
"
15 4 Cartman "Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
"
15 4 Cartman "I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
15 4 Cartman "Go look for yourselves!!
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
15 4 Cartman "No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
"
15 4 Cartman "They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
15 4 Cartman "Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
"
15 4 Cartman "Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
15 4 Cartman "Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
"
15 4 Cartman "What, Kyle?
"
15 4 Cartman "I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, it's pretty good.
"
15 4 Cartman "Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
15 4 Cartman "There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, Goddamnit!
"
15 4 Cartman "Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
"
15 4 Cartman "For what?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
15 4 Cartman "You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
15 4 Cartman "What?
"
15 4 Cartman "Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
15 4 Cartman "I don't know! Why would you?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
15 4 Cartman "Fuck you! No I don't!
"
15 4 Cartman "Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
15 4 Cartman "Why the fuck am I here?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
15 4 Cartman "Oh, that's cool.
"
15 4 Cartman "My penis is 13 inches long.
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah dude!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah!
"
15 4 Cartman "Burn it down, dude! 
"
15 4 Cartman "The Jews!
"
15 4 Cartman "No, and fuck Kyle!
"
15 4 Cartman "Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait, what?
"
15 4 Cartman "Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
15 4 Cartman "I'm still fucking angry!
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ah, crap! 
"
15 5 Cartman "Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
15 5 Cartman "What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
"
15 5 Cartman "Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
"
15 5 Cartman "Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
15 5 Cartman "What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
15 5 Cartman "Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
15 5 Cartman "After you. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Come on. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
15 5 Cartman "It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
15 5 Cartman "Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
15 5 Cartman "We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
15 5 Cartman "You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
"
15 5 Cartman "Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Betsy MacIntosh?
"
15 5 Cartman "We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
15 5 Cartman "We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
15 5 Cartman "And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
15 5 Cartman "Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
15 5 Cartman "We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
"
15 5 Cartman "Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
15 5 Cartman "Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
"
15 5 Cartman "Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
15 5 Cartman "Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
15 5 Cartman "Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
"
15 5 Cartman "They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
15 5 Cartman "Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
15 5 Cartman "What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
15 5 Cartman "We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
"
15 5 Cartman "Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
15 5 Cartman "Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
15 5 Cartman "A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
15 5 Cartman "It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
15 5 Cartman "Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
15 5 Cartman "My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
"
15 5 Cartman "You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
15 5 Cartman "Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
15 5 Cartman "I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
15 5 Cartman "But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
15 5 Cartman "You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
15 5 Cartman "How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
15 5 Cartman "How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
15 5 Cartman "Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
15 5 Cartman "Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
15 5 Cartman "...What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
15 5 Cartman "This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
"
15 5 Cartman "What?
"
15 5 Cartman "Vunter Slash?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
15 5 Cartman "But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
15 5 Cartman "Are you fucking serious? 
"
15 5 Cartman "You knew about this??
"
15 5 Cartman "I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
15 5 Cartman "I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
15 5 Cartman "He is real, you guys. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
15 7 Cartman "Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!
"
15 7 Cartman "What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
15 7 Cartman "Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
15 7 Cartman "Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
15 7 Cartman "Turn it off dude!
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
15 7 Cartman "He's lying, dude. Hit X
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
15 7 Cartman "Look like ice cream to me.
"
15 7 Cartman "...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
15 7 Cartman "Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
15 7 Cartman "That looks pretty good.
"
15 7 Cartman "Stan, knock it off!
"
15 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
15 7 Cartman "Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
15 8 Cartman "Yep!
"
15 8 Cartman "Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait what?
"
15 8 Cartman "Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
"
15 8 Cartman "You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
15 8 Cartman "That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
15 8 Cartman "Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
15 8 Cartman "Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
15 8 Cartman "Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
"
15 8 Cartman "I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
15 8 Cartman "A what??
"
15 8 Cartman "Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
"
15 8 Cartman "What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
15 8 Cartman "Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
15 8 Cartman "Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
15 8 Cartman "I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
15 8 Cartman "Really?
"
15 8 Cartman "Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
15 8 Cartman "Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
15 8 Cartman "There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
15 8 Cartman "How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
"
15 8 Cartman "Nice!
"
15 8 Cartman "It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
15 8 Cartman "Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
15 8 Cartman "We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
15 8 Cartman "Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
"
15 8 Cartman "The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
15 9 Cartman "Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
"
15 9 Cartman "Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
15 9 Cartman "He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!

15 9 Cartman "Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
15 9 Cartman "Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
15 9 Cartman "Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh God! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
"
15 9 Cartman "At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
"
15 9 Cartman "Where is Butters?
"
15 9 Cartman "All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
15 9 Cartman "You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
15 9 Cartman "Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh dude. Sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
15 9 Cartman "Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
15 9 Cartman "No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
15 9 Cartman "Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
15 9 Cartman "Oh no you don't! 
"
15 9 Cartman "That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
15 9 Cartman "No you won't Butters!
"
15 9 Cartman "Ey!
"
15 9 Cartman "¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
15 9 Cartman "Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
15 9 Cartman "I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
15 9 Cartman "A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
15 10 Cartman "YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
15 10 Cartman "You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
"
15 10 Cartman "He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
15 10 Cartman "Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, he killed himself.
"
15 10 Cartman "Hey! Whoooa.
"
15 10 Cartman "'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
"
15 10 Cartman "You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
15 10 Cartman "Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
15 10 Cartman "Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
15 10 Cartman "You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
15 10 Cartman "Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
15 10 Cartman "So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
15 10 Cartman "I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
15 10 Cartman "I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
15 10 Cartman "You okay, Jenny?
"
15 10 Cartman "Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
15 10 Cartman "Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
15 10 Cartman "WAY worse!
"
15 10 Cartman "Alright, kewl.
"
15 10 Cartman "You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
15 10 Cartman "Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
"
15 10 Cartman "Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
15 10 Cartman "Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
15 10 Cartman "Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
15 10 Cartman "Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
15 10 Cartman "It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
15 10 Cartman "Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
15 10 Cartman "No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
15 10 Cartman "That. Was. Amazing.
"
15 10 Cartman "Boy, I say.
"
15 10 Cartman "It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
15 10 Cartman "Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
15 10 Cartman "Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
"
15 10 Cartman "I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
15 11 Cartman "Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
15 12 Cartman "Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
15 12 Cartman "Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
15 12 Cartman "Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
15 12 Cartman "Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
15 12 Cartman "Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
15 12 Cartman "Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
15 12 Cartman "What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Mom, have you been here all day?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
15 12 Cartman "No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
"
15 12 Cartman "Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
15 12 Cartman "Fly bu-what?
"
15 12 Cartman "Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
15 12 Cartman "Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
15 12 Cartman "I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
"
15 12 Cartman "Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
"
15 12 Cartman "That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
15 12 Cartman "So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
15 12 Cartman "What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
15 12 Cartman "Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
15 12 Cartman "This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
15 12 Cartman "Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
"
15 12 Cartman "What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
15 12 Cartman "Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
"
15 12 Cartman "Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
15 12 Cartman "What?! Who?!
"
15 12 Cartman "I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
15 12 Cartman "Oh sure!
"
15 12 Cartman "Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
15 12 Cartman "HAAAAGH! 
"
15 12 Cartman "I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
15 12 Cartman "Who did this to you?!
"
15 12 Cartman "Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
15 12 Cartman "AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
15 12 Cartman "...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
15 12 Cartman "They were your FRIENDS!
"
15 12 Cartman "Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
"
15 12 Cartman "There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
15 12 Cartman "Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
"
15 12 Cartman "Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
15 13 Cartman "Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
15 13 Cartman "This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
"
15 13 Cartman "Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
15 13 Cartman "Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
15 13 Cartman "Uh-huh??
"
15 13 Cartman "Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
15 13 Cartman "See what I mean, you guys? 
"
15 13 Cartman "Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
15 13 Cartman "Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh no. Oh NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
15 13 Cartman "You guys have stuffing?!
"
15 13 Cartman "Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
15 13 Cartman "No!
"
15 13 Cartman "NO!
"
15 13 Cartman "Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
15 13 Cartman "Uhhh??
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
15 14 Cartman "Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
15 14 Cartman "Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
15 14 Cartman "Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
15 14 Cartman "This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Eh yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "Heh heh, yeah?
"
15 14 Cartman "What?
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
15 14 Cartman "That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
15 14 Cartman "Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
15 14 Cartman "You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
15 14 Cartman "We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
15 14 Cartman "Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
15 14 Cartman "IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
15 14 Cartman "My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
15 14 Cartman "What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, yeah.
"
15 14 Cartman "That's right.
"
15 14 Cartman "Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
"
15 14 Cartman "A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
15 14 Cartman "How?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
15 14 Cartman "Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
15 14 Cartman "Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
15 14 Cartman "What??  Greeley?
"
15 14 Cartman "What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
15 14 Cartman "You're my new mom?
"
15 14 Cartman "Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
15 14 Cartman "Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
15 14 Cartman "You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Really?
"
15 14 Cartman "YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
15 14 Cartman "Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
15 14 Cartman "I wasn't making fun of anybody.
"
15 14 Cartman "I was just teasing.
"
15 14 Cartman "My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
15 14 Cartman "Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
15 14 Cartman "Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it.
"
15 14 Cartman "I'm not saying it!
"
15 14 Cartman "Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
15 14 Cartman "There he is, there's my buddy.
"
15 14 Cartman "Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
15 14 Cartman "Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""
"
