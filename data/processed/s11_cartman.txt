11 1 Cartman "Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
11 1 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh?
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
11 1 Cartman "Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
11 1 Cartman "Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
11 1 Cartman "No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
11 1 Cartman "Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Barely! 
"
11 1 Cartman """Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
11 1 Cartman "Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
11 1 Cartman "Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
11 1 Cartman "It's a midget, dude.
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Say ""Uncle!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
11 2 Cartman "This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
11 2 Cartman "Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyyyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
11 2 Cartman "Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
11 2 Cartman "You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
11 2 Cartman "It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
11 2 Cartman "I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
"
11 2 Cartman "Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
11 2 Cartman "Eh- ...what?
"
11 2 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
"
11 2 Cartman "But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
"
11 2 Cartman "How?
"
11 2 Cartman "Really?
"
11 2 Cartman "...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
11 2 Cartman "You ready?
"
11 2 Cartman "Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
"
11 2 Cartman "Hang on a second here. 
"
11 2 Cartman "'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
11 2 Cartman "...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Uh! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
11 2 Cartman "I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
11 2 Cartman "That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Right, except for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "Why would you tell anybody?
"
11 2 Cartman "...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
"
11 2 Cartman "Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
11 2 Cartman "Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
"
11 2 Cartman "You know God damned well what!
"
11 2 Cartman "I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
11 2 Cartman "Give it back, Kyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
11 2 Cartman "You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
11 2 Cartman "Why... why does that matter?
"
11 2 Cartman "All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
"
11 2 Cartman "I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
11 2 Cartman "That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
11 2 Cartman "I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
"
11 2 Cartman "Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
11 2 Cartman "Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
11 2 Cartman "But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
"
11 2 Cartman "But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
11 2 Cartman "You, you will?
"
11 2 Cartman "It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
11 2 Cartman "What?
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, she's lying!
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
11 2 Cartman "Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
"
11 2 Cartman "Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
11 2 Cartman "HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
11 2 Cartman "And now this next picture 
"
11 2 Cartman "And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
11 2 Cartman "What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
"
11 2 Cartman "...Lame.
"
11 3 Cartman "Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
11 3 Cartman "Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
11 3 Cartman "They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
11 3 Cartman "This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
"
11 3 Cartman "Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
11 3 Cartman "Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
11 3 Cartman "Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
11 3 Cartman "That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
"
11 3 Cartman "Me?!
"
11 3 Cartman "I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
11 3 Cartman "That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
11 3 Cartman "And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
"
11 3 Cartman "There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, lock that door, Craig! 
"
11 3 Cartman "I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
11 3 Cartman "This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
11 3 Cartman "I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
11 3 Cartman "If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
11 3 Cartman "Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
11 3 Cartman "Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
11 3 Cartman "It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
11 3 Cartman "He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
11 3 Cartman "What, Clyde?
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Guilty! I thought so! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
11 3 Cartman "But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh oh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
11 4 Cartman "Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
11 4 Cartman "What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
11 4 Cartman "No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
11 4 Cartman "That's funny.
"
11 4 Cartman "He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
"
11 4 Cartman "The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
11 4 Cartman "Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
11 4 Cartman "I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
11 4 Cartman "If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
11 4 Cartman "Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
11 4 Cartman "Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
11 4 Cartman "Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
11 4 Cartman "What?
"
11 4 Cartman "Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
11 4 Cartman "He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
11 4 Cartman "I said I will only talk to the President!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
11 4 Cartman "Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
11 4 Cartman "It's my balls! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
11 4 Cartman "Why? Did you find something?
"
11 4 Cartman "A snuke?
"
11 4 Cartman "I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
"
11 4 Cartman "Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Big surprise!
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me have time with him.
"
11 4 Cartman "We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator?!
"
11 4 Cartman "I can do this aaall day.
"
11 4 Cartman "You can make it stop!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is your son?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Answer it! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 4 Cartman "We got him! I know where he is!
"
11 4 Cartman "No no, he's my lead. 
"
11 4 Cartman "You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uuugh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator!
"
11 4 Cartman "You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
"
11 4 Cartman "Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
11 4 Cartman "That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
"
11 4 Cartman "Uhh yes, of course?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Russians?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans again?
"
11 4 Cartman "You can't possible mean...?
"
11 4 Cartman "Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
11 4 Cartman "But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
11 4 Cartman "Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
11 4 Cartman "Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
11 4 Cartman "But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
11 5 Cartman "And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
11 5 Cartman "Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
11 5 Cartman "Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Have you lost your mind?
"
11 6 Cartman "You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
11 6 Cartman "No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
11 6 Cartman "¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
11 6 Cartman "Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, gracias.
"
11 6 Cartman "Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
11 6 Cartman "They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
11 6 Cartman "All right, did you write the four essays?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, let's have 'em.
"
11 6 Cartman "Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
"
11 6 Cartman "Crap! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
11 6 Cartman "That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
11 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
11 7 Cartman "Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
11 7 Cartman "Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
"
11 7 Cartman "There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
11 7 Cartman "No! Fuck off! 
"
11 7 Cartman "Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
11 7 Cartman "You what?!
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
11 7 Cartman "You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
11 7 Cartman "They're everywhere!
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
11 7 Cartman "Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
11 7 Cartman "I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
11 7 Cartman "I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
11 7 Cartman "Cool.
"
11 7 Cartman "Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
"
11 7 Cartman "Youu heard about that?
"
11 7 Cartman "Thirty was hard enough.
"
11 7 Cartman "Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.

"
11 8 Cartman "The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
"
11 8 Cartman "Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Are you talkin' to me?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What's your problem, kid?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What?
"
11 8 Cartman "Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
"
11 8 Cartman "All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
11 8 Cartman "Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
"
11 8 Cartman "I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
11 8 Cartman "Puh- pussy!
"
11 8 Cartman "Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
"
11 8 Cartman "...Cocksucker!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
11 8 Cartman "But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
11 8 Cartman "...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
"
11 8 Cartman "Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dicktits!
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
11 8 Cartman "Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
11 8 Cartman "That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
11 8 Cartman "Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
11 8 Cartman "Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
11 8 Cartman "Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
11 8 Cartman "Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
11 8 Cartman "Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
11 8 Cartman "Hm. That was... weird.
"
11 8 Cartman "Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
11 8 Cartman "And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
"
11 8 Cartman "No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
11 8 Cartman "I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
11 8 Cartman "Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
11 8 Cartman "No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "But I'm not gonna do the-
"
11 8 Cartman "I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
11 8 Cartman "You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
11 8 Cartman "How does he do that?
"
11 8 Cartman "Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, what are you doing?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
"
11 8 Cartman "I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
11 8 Cartman "You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
11 10 Cartman "All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
11 10 Cartman "It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
11 10 Cartman "Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
11 10 Cartman "O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
11 10 Cartman "Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
"
11 10 Cartman "Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
"
11 10 Cartman "It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
11 10 Cartman "Set off diversion track C! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
11 10 Cartman "Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
11 10 Cartman "Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
11 10 Cartman "Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
11 10 Cartman "We had a deal, Kyle!
"
11 10 Cartman "You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
"
11 10 Cartman "And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
11 10 Cartman "Yesss!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
11 10 Cartman "He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
"
11 10 Cartman "What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hey, let go of him! 
"
11 10 Cartman "No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
"
11 10 Cartman "I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
"
11 11 Cartman "Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
"
11 11 Cartman "NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
11 11 Cartman "Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
11 11 Cartman "Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
"
11 11 Cartman "Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
11 11 Cartman "That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
11 11 Cartman "Theee conference room is which way? 
"
11 11 Cartman "Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
11 11 Cartman "Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
"
11 11 Cartman "I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
11 11 Cartman "No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
11 11 Cartman "In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
11 11 Cartman "Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Goddammit no!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Kyle can't die. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 11 Cartman "NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
"
11 11 Cartman "Zap him again!  Do it!
"
11 11 Cartman "DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
11 11 Cartman "Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Wake up, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
"
11 12 Cartman "What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
11 12 Cartman "You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
11 12 Cartman "Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
11 12 Cartman "How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
11 12 Cartman "...What?
"
11 12 Cartman "Where are you going?!
"
11 12 Cartman "Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
11 12 Cartman "We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
11 12 Cartman "IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
"
11 12 Cartman "What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
11 12 Cartman "You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
11 12 Cartman "Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
11 12 Cartman "No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
11 12 Cartman "Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
11 12 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stan, you guys are good! 
"
11 13 Cartman "Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
11 13 Cartman "Real guitars are for old people.
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
11 13 Cartman "Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
11 13 Cartman "All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
11 13 Cartman "'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
11 13 Cartman "What?
"
11 13 Cartman "Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
11 14 Cartman "They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
11 14 Cartman "Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
11 14 Cartman "Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
11 14 Cartman "No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
"
11 14 Cartman "Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
11 14 Cartman "You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
11 14 Cartman "Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
11 14 Cartman "Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
11 14 Cartman "Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
11 14 Cartman "At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
11 14 Cartman "Bail, bail! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
11 14 Cartman "Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
11 14 Cartman "We got it! We got it! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
11 14 Cartman "What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
11 14 Cartman "You're last, dude! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Yes way! Check it out! 
"
11 14 Cartman "So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"
11 14 Cartman "I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
"
11 14 Cartman "Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
11 14 Cartman "Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
11 1 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh?
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
11 1 Cartman "Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
11 1 Cartman "Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
11 1 Cartman "No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
11 1 Cartman "Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Barely! 
"
11 1 Cartman """Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
11 1 Cartman "Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
11 1 Cartman "Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
11 1 Cartman "It's a midget, dude.
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Say ""Uncle!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
11 2 Cartman "This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
11 2 Cartman "Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyyyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
11 2 Cartman "Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
11 2 Cartman "You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
11 2 Cartman "It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
11 2 Cartman "I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
"
11 2 Cartman "Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
11 2 Cartman "Eh- ...what?
"
11 2 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
"
11 2 Cartman "But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
"
11 2 Cartman "How?
"
11 2 Cartman "Really?
"
11 2 Cartman "...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
11 2 Cartman "You ready?
"
11 2 Cartman "Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
"
11 2 Cartman "Hang on a second here. 
"
11 2 Cartman "'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
11 2 Cartman "...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Uh! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
11 2 Cartman "I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
11 2 Cartman "That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Right, except for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "Why would you tell anybody?
"
11 2 Cartman "...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
"
11 2 Cartman "Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
11 2 Cartman "Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
"
11 2 Cartman "You know God damned well what!
"
11 2 Cartman "I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
11 2 Cartman "Give it back, Kyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
11 2 Cartman "You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
11 2 Cartman "Why... why does that matter?
"
11 2 Cartman "All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
"
11 2 Cartman "I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
11 2 Cartman "That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
11 2 Cartman "I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
"
11 2 Cartman "Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
11 2 Cartman "Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
11 2 Cartman "But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
"
11 2 Cartman "But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
11 2 Cartman "You, you will?
"
11 2 Cartman "It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
11 2 Cartman "What?
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, she's lying!
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
11 2 Cartman "Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
"
11 2 Cartman "Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
11 2 Cartman "HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
11 2 Cartman "And now this next picture 
"
11 2 Cartman "And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
11 2 Cartman "What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
"
11 2 Cartman "...Lame.
"
11 3 Cartman "Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
11 3 Cartman "Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
11 3 Cartman "They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
11 3 Cartman "This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
"
11 3 Cartman "Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
11 3 Cartman "Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
11 3 Cartman "Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
11 3 Cartman "That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
"
11 3 Cartman "Me?!
"
11 3 Cartman "I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
11 3 Cartman "That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
11 3 Cartman "And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
"
11 3 Cartman "There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, lock that door, Craig! 
"
11 3 Cartman "I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
11 3 Cartman "This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
11 3 Cartman "I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
11 3 Cartman "If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
11 3 Cartman "Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
11 3 Cartman "Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
11 3 Cartman "It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
11 3 Cartman "He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
11 3 Cartman "What, Clyde?
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Guilty! I thought so! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
11 3 Cartman "But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh oh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
11 4 Cartman "Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
11 4 Cartman "What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
11 4 Cartman "No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
11 4 Cartman "That's funny.
"
11 4 Cartman "He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
"
11 4 Cartman "The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
11 4 Cartman "Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
11 4 Cartman "I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
11 4 Cartman "If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
11 4 Cartman "Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
11 4 Cartman "Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
11 4 Cartman "Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
11 4 Cartman "What?
"
11 4 Cartman "Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
11 4 Cartman "He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
11 4 Cartman "I said I will only talk to the President!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
11 4 Cartman "Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
11 4 Cartman "It's my balls! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
11 4 Cartman "Why? Did you find something?
"
11 4 Cartman "A snuke?
"
11 4 Cartman "I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
"
11 4 Cartman "Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Big surprise!
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me have time with him.
"
11 4 Cartman "We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator?!
"
11 4 Cartman "I can do this aaall day.
"
11 4 Cartman "You can make it stop!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is your son?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Answer it! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 4 Cartman "We got him! I know where he is!
"
11 4 Cartman "No no, he's my lead. 
"
11 4 Cartman "You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uuugh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator!
"
11 4 Cartman "You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
"
11 4 Cartman "Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
11 4 Cartman "That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
"
11 4 Cartman "Uhh yes, of course?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Russians?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans again?
"
11 4 Cartman "You can't possible mean...?
"
11 4 Cartman "Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
11 4 Cartman "But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
11 4 Cartman "Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
11 4 Cartman "Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
11 4 Cartman "But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
11 5 Cartman "And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
11 5 Cartman "Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
11 5 Cartman "Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Have you lost your mind?
"
11 6 Cartman "You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
11 6 Cartman "No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
11 6 Cartman "¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
11 6 Cartman "Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, gracias.
"
11 6 Cartman "Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
11 6 Cartman "They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
11 6 Cartman "All right, did you write the four essays?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, let's have 'em.
"
11 6 Cartman "Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
"
11 6 Cartman "Crap! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
11 6 Cartman "That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
11 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
11 7 Cartman "Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
11 7 Cartman "Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
"
11 7 Cartman "There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
11 7 Cartman "No! Fuck off! 
"
11 7 Cartman "Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
11 7 Cartman "You what?!
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
11 7 Cartman "You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
11 7 Cartman "They're everywhere!
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
11 7 Cartman "Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
11 7 Cartman "I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
11 7 Cartman "I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
11 7 Cartman "Cool.
"
11 7 Cartman "Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
"
11 7 Cartman "Youu heard about that?
"
11 7 Cartman "Thirty was hard enough.
"
11 7 Cartman "Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.

"
11 8 Cartman "The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
"
11 8 Cartman "Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Are you talkin' to me?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What's your problem, kid?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What?
"
11 8 Cartman "Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
"
11 8 Cartman "All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
11 8 Cartman "Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
"
11 8 Cartman "I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
11 8 Cartman "Puh- pussy!
"
11 8 Cartman "Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
"
11 8 Cartman "...Cocksucker!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
11 8 Cartman "But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
11 8 Cartman "...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
"
11 8 Cartman "Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dicktits!
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
11 8 Cartman "Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
11 8 Cartman "That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
11 8 Cartman "Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
11 8 Cartman "Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
11 8 Cartman "Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
11 8 Cartman "Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
11 8 Cartman "Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
11 8 Cartman "Hm. That was... weird.
"
11 8 Cartman "Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
11 8 Cartman "And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
"
11 8 Cartman "No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
11 8 Cartman "I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
11 8 Cartman "Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
11 8 Cartman "No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "But I'm not gonna do the-
"
11 8 Cartman "I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
11 8 Cartman "You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
11 8 Cartman "How does he do that?
"
11 8 Cartman "Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, what are you doing?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
"
11 8 Cartman "I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
11 8 Cartman "You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
11 10 Cartman "All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
11 10 Cartman "It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
11 10 Cartman "Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
11 10 Cartman "O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
11 10 Cartman "Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
"
11 10 Cartman "Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
"
11 10 Cartman "It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
11 10 Cartman "Set off diversion track C! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
11 10 Cartman "Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
11 10 Cartman "Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
11 10 Cartman "Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
11 10 Cartman "We had a deal, Kyle!
"
11 10 Cartman "You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
"
11 10 Cartman "And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
11 10 Cartman "Yesss!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
11 10 Cartman "He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
"
11 10 Cartman "What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hey, let go of him! 
"
11 10 Cartman "No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
"
11 10 Cartman "I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
"
11 11 Cartman "Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
"
11 11 Cartman "NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
11 11 Cartman "Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
11 11 Cartman "Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
"
11 11 Cartman "Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
11 11 Cartman "That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
11 11 Cartman "Theee conference room is which way? 
"
11 11 Cartman "Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
11 11 Cartman "Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
"
11 11 Cartman "I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
11 11 Cartman "No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
11 11 Cartman "In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
11 11 Cartman "Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Goddammit no!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Kyle can't die. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 11 Cartman "NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
"
11 11 Cartman "Zap him again!  Do it!
"
11 11 Cartman "DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
11 11 Cartman "Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Wake up, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
"
11 12 Cartman "What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
11 12 Cartman "You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
11 12 Cartman "Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
11 12 Cartman "How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
11 12 Cartman "...What?
"
11 12 Cartman "Where are you going?!
"
11 12 Cartman "Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
11 12 Cartman "We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
11 12 Cartman "IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
"
11 12 Cartman "What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
11 12 Cartman "You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
11 12 Cartman "Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
11 12 Cartman "No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
11 12 Cartman "Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
11 12 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stan, you guys are good! 
"
11 13 Cartman "Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
11 13 Cartman "Real guitars are for old people.
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
11 13 Cartman "Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
11 13 Cartman "All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
11 13 Cartman "'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
11 13 Cartman "What?
"
11 13 Cartman "Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
11 14 Cartman "They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
11 14 Cartman "Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
11 14 Cartman "Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
11 14 Cartman "No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
"
11 14 Cartman "Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
11 14 Cartman "You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
11 14 Cartman "Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
11 14 Cartman "Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
11 14 Cartman "Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
11 14 Cartman "At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
11 14 Cartman "Bail, bail! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
11 14 Cartman "Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
11 14 Cartman "We got it! We got it! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
11 14 Cartman "What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
11 14 Cartman "You're last, dude! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Yes way! Check it out! 
"
11 14 Cartman "So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"
11 14 Cartman "I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
"
11 14 Cartman "Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
11 14 Cartman "Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
11 1 Cartman "Ohhhhhhhh?
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
11 1 Cartman "Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
11 1 Cartman "Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
11 1 Cartman "No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
11 1 Cartman "Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
11 1 Cartman "Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Barely! 
"
11 1 Cartman """Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
11 1 Cartman "Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
11 1 Cartman "Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
11 1 Cartman "Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
11 1 Cartman "It's a midget, dude.
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
11 1 Cartman "Say ""Uncle!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
11 1 Cartman "Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
11 2 Cartman "This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
11 2 Cartman "Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyyyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
11 2 Cartman "Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
11 2 Cartman "Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
11 2 Cartman "You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
11 2 Cartman "It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
11 2 Cartman "I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
"
11 2 Cartman "Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
11 2 Cartman "Eh- ...what?
"
11 2 Cartman "Nuh uh.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
"
11 2 Cartman "But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
11 2 Cartman "No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
"
11 2 Cartman "How?
"
11 2 Cartman "Really?
"
11 2 Cartman "...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 2 Cartman "Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
11 2 Cartman "You ready?
"
11 2 Cartman "Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
"
11 2 Cartman "Hang on a second here. 
"
11 2 Cartman "'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
11 2 Cartman "...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
11 2 Cartman "All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Uh! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
11 2 Cartman "I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
11 2 Cartman "That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Right, except for you.
"
11 2 Cartman "Why would you tell anybody?
"
11 2 Cartman "...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
"
11 2 Cartman "Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
11 2 Cartman "Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
11 2 Cartman "Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
11 2 Cartman "Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
"
11 2 Cartman "You know God damned well what!
"
11 2 Cartman "I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
11 2 Cartman "Give it back, Kyle!
"
11 2 Cartman "I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
11 2 Cartman "You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
11 2 Cartman "Why... why does that matter?
"
11 2 Cartman "All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
11 2 Cartman "It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
11 2 Cartman "No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
"
11 2 Cartman "I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
11 2 Cartman "That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
11 2 Cartman "I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
11 2 Cartman "Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
"
11 2 Cartman "Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
11 2 Cartman "Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
11 2 Cartman "But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
"
11 2 Cartman "But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
11 2 Cartman "You, you will?
"
11 2 Cartman "It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
11 2 Cartman "What?
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, she's lying!
"
11 2 Cartman "Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
11 2 Cartman "Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
"
11 2 Cartman "Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
11 2 Cartman "HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
11 2 Cartman "And now this next picture 
"
11 2 Cartman "And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
11 2 Cartman "Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
11 2 Cartman "What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
"
11 2 Cartman "...Lame.
"
11 3 Cartman "Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
11 3 Cartman "Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
11 3 Cartman "They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
11 3 Cartman "This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
"
11 3 Cartman "Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
11 3 Cartman "Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
11 3 Cartman "Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
11 3 Cartman "That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
"
11 3 Cartman "Me?!
"
11 3 Cartman "I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
11 3 Cartman "That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
11 3 Cartman "And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
"
11 3 Cartman "There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, lock that door, Craig! 
"
11 3 Cartman "I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
11 3 Cartman "This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
11 3 Cartman "I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
11 3 Cartman "If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
11 3 Cartman "Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
11 3 Cartman "Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
11 3 Cartman "It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
11 3 Cartman "He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
11 3 Cartman "What, Clyde?
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
11 3 Cartman "Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Guilty! I thought so! 
"
11 3 Cartman "All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
11 3 Cartman "Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
11 3 Cartman "Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
11 3 Cartman "But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh oh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
11 4 Cartman "Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
11 4 Cartman "What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
11 4 Cartman "No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
11 4 Cartman "Get online now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
11 4 Cartman "That's funny.
"
11 4 Cartman "He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
"
11 4 Cartman "The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
11 4 Cartman "Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
11 4 Cartman "I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
11 4 Cartman "If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
11 4 Cartman "Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
11 4 Cartman "Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
11 4 Cartman "Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
11 4 Cartman "What?
"
11 4 Cartman "Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
11 4 Cartman "He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
11 4 Cartman "I said I will only talk to the President!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
11 4 Cartman "President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
11 4 Cartman "Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
11 4 Cartman "Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
11 4 Cartman "Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
11 4 Cartman "It's my balls! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yeah? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
11 4 Cartman "Why? Did you find something?
"
11 4 Cartman "A snuke?
"
11 4 Cartman "I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
"
11 4 Cartman "Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Big surprise!
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me have time with him.
"
11 4 Cartman "We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator?!
"
11 4 Cartman "I can do this aaall day.
"
11 4 Cartman "You can make it stop!
"
11 4 Cartman "Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
11 4 Cartman "Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is your son?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Answer it! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Butters.
"
11 4 Cartman "We got him! I know where he is!
"
11 4 Cartman "No no, he's my lead. 
"
11 4 Cartman "You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uuugh! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Where is the detonator!
"
11 4 Cartman "You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
"
11 4 Cartman "Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
11 4 Cartman "Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
11 4 Cartman "Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
11 4 Cartman "That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
"
11 4 Cartman "Uhh yes, of course?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Russians?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans?
"
11 4 Cartman "The Germans again?
"
11 4 Cartman "You can't possible mean...?
"
11 4 Cartman "Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
11 4 Cartman "But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
11 4 Cartman "Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
11 4 Cartman "Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
"
11 4 Cartman "Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
11 4 Cartman "But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
"
11 4 Cartman "Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
11 5 Cartman "And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
11 5 Cartman "Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
11 5 Cartman "Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Have you lost your mind?
"
11 6 Cartman "You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
11 6 Cartman "No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
11 6 Cartman "¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
11 6 Cartman "Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, gracias.
"
11 6 Cartman "Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
11 6 Cartman "They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
11 6 Cartman "All right, did you write the four essays?
"
11 6 Cartman "Okay, let's have 'em.
"
11 6 Cartman "Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
"
11 6 Cartman "Crap! 
"
11 6 Cartman "Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
11 6 Cartman "That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
11 7 Cartman "No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
11 7 Cartman "Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
11 7 Cartman "Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
"
11 7 Cartman "There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
11 7 Cartman "No! Fuck off! 
"
11 7 Cartman "Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
11 7 Cartman "You what?!
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
11 7 Cartman "You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
11 7 Cartman "They're everywhere!
"
11 7 Cartman "Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
11 7 Cartman "Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
11 7 Cartman "All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
11 7 Cartman "I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
11 7 Cartman "I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
11 7 Cartman "Cool.
"
11 7 Cartman "Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
11 7 Cartman "Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
"
11 7 Cartman "Youu heard about that?
"
11 7 Cartman "Thirty was hard enough.
"
11 7 Cartman "Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.

11 8 Cartman "The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
"
11 8 Cartman "Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Are you talkin' to me?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What's your problem, kid?!
"
11 8 Cartman "What?
"
11 8 Cartman "Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
"
11 8 Cartman "All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
11 8 Cartman "Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
"
11 8 Cartman "I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
11 8 Cartman "Puh- pussy!
"
11 8 Cartman "Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
"
11 8 Cartman "...Cocksucker!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
11 8 Cartman "But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
"
11 8 Cartman "Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
11 8 Cartman "...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
"
11 8 Cartman "Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dicktits!
"
11 8 Cartman "Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
11 8 Cartman "Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
11 8 Cartman "That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
11 8 Cartman "Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
"
11 8 Cartman "Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
11 8 Cartman "Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
11 8 Cartman "Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
11 8 Cartman "Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
11 8 Cartman "Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
11 8 Cartman "Hm. That was... weird.
"
11 8 Cartman "Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
11 8 Cartman "And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
"
11 8 Cartman "No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
11 8 Cartman "Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
11 8 Cartman "I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
11 8 Cartman "Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
11 8 Cartman "Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
11 8 Cartman "No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
11 8 Cartman "But I'm not gonna do the-
"
11 8 Cartman "I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
11 8 Cartman "You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
11 8 Cartman "No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
11 8 Cartman "No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
11 8 Cartman "How does he do that?
"
11 8 Cartman "Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 8 Cartman "Kyle, what are you doing?
"
11 8 Cartman "Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
"
11 8 Cartman "I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
11 8 Cartman "You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
11 10 Cartman "All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
11 10 Cartman "It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
11 10 Cartman "Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
11 10 Cartman "O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
11 10 Cartman "Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
"
11 10 Cartman "Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
"
11 10 Cartman "It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
11 10 Cartman "Set off diversion track C! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
11 10 Cartman "Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
11 10 Cartman "Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
11 10 Cartman "Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
11 10 Cartman "Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
11 10 Cartman "We had a deal, Kyle!
"
11 10 Cartman "You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
"
11 10 Cartman "And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
11 10 Cartman "I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
11 10 Cartman "Yesss!
"
11 10 Cartman "Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
11 10 Cartman "He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
"
11 10 Cartman "What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
11 10 Cartman "Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Hey, let go of him! 
"
11 10 Cartman "No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
11 10 Cartman "Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
"
11 10 Cartman "I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
"
11 11 Cartman "Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
"
11 11 Cartman "NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
11 11 Cartman "Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
11 11 Cartman "Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
"
11 11 Cartman "Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
11 11 Cartman "That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
11 11 Cartman "Theee conference room is which way? 
"
11 11 Cartman "Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
11 11 Cartman "Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
11 11 Cartman "Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
"
11 11 Cartman "I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
11 11 Cartman "No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
11 11 Cartman "In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
11 11 Cartman "Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Goddammit no!
"
11 11 Cartman "No! Kyle can't die. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 11 Cartman "NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
"
11 11 Cartman "Zap him again!  Do it!
"
11 11 Cartman "DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
11 11 Cartman "Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
11 11 Cartman "Wake up, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
"
11 12 Cartman "What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
11 12 Cartman "You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
11 12 Cartman "Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
11 12 Cartman "Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
11 12 Cartman "How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
11 12 Cartman "...What?
"
11 12 Cartman "Where are you going?!
"
11 12 Cartman "Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
11 12 Cartman "We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
11 12 Cartman "IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
"
11 12 Cartman "What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
11 12 Cartman "You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
11 12 Cartman "Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
11 12 Cartman "No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
11 12 Cartman "Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
11 12 Cartman "Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
11 12 Cartman "You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
11 12 Cartman "O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
11 12 Cartman "No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
11 12 Cartman "Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stan, you guys are good! 
"
11 13 Cartman "Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
11 13 Cartman "Real guitars are for old people.
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
11 13 Cartman "Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
11 13 Cartman "All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
11 13 Cartman "Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
11 13 Cartman "Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
11 13 Cartman "'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
11 13 Cartman "What?
"
11 13 Cartman "Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
11 14 Cartman "They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
11 14 Cartman "Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
11 14 Cartman "Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
11 14 Cartman "No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
"
11 14 Cartman "Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
11 14 Cartman "You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
11 14 Cartman "Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
11 14 Cartman "Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
11 14 Cartman "Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
11 14 Cartman "All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
11 14 Cartman "At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
11 14 Cartman "Bail, bail! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
11 14 Cartman "Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
11 14 Cartman "Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
11 14 Cartman "We got it! We got it! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
11 14 Cartman "What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
11 14 Cartman "You're last, dude! 
"
11 14 Cartman "Yes way! Check it out! 
"
