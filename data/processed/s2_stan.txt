2 2 Stan "Oooh- hey, Kenny.
"
2 2 Stan "Could you pull over so I can get out?
"
2 2 Stan "I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"
2 2 Stan "Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
"
2 2 Stan "Oogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Ooooogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Aghh!
"
2 2 Stan "I'm gotta get outta here!
"
2 2 Stan "Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh, weak. 
"
2 2 Stan "Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
"
2 2 Stan "No way, dude!
"
2 2 Stan "No.
"
2 2 Stan "Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 2 Stan "He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
"
2 3 Stan "If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
2 3 Stan "Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
"
2 3 Stan "Hey, what's this? 
"
2 3 Stan "Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
"
2 3 Stan "I can't see, dude!
"
2 3 Stan "No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
2 3 Stan "Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, never mind. 
"
2 3 Stan "It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 3 Stan """If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".
"
2 3 Stan "I.
"
2 3 Stan "A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
"
2 3 Stan "Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
"
2 3 Stan "What's it say? What's it say?
"
2 3 Stan "I dunno.
"
2 3 Stan "Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
"
2 3 Stan "Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
"
2 3 Stan "Look! 
"
2 3 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Goddammit!
"
2 3 Stan "Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "What are you talking about, dude?!
"
2 3 Stan "That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey! So what are you going to do now?
"
2 3 Stan "They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
"
2 3 Stan "I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
"
2 4 Stan "Booooo!
"
2 4 Stan "I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Why do dogs have cold noses?
"
2 4 Stan "Oh.
"
2 4 Stan "Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
"
2 4 Stan "Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
"
2 4 Stan "Well, dude, you better find out!
"
2 4 Stan "Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
"
2 4 Stan "No, dude, we never even saw it!
"
2 4 Stan "We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
"
2 4 Stan "What do ya mean?
"
2 4 Stan "Ahhh, bicycles?
"
2 4 Stan "Your eyes? 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
"
2 4 Stan "Kyle! You have to stop them!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
2 4 Stan "They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
"
2 4 Stan "What are you goin' to do, dude?
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
"
2 4 Stan "Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
2 4 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 4 Stan "Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
"
2 4 Stan "Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
"
2 4 Stan "Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 4 Stan "Naturally.
"
2 4 Stan "You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
"
2 4 Stan "Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 5 Stan "Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
"
2 5 Stan "If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
"
2 5 Stan "Dammit, we lost one already!
"
2 5 Stan "Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 
"
2 5 Stan "We're losing men fast out here! 
"
2 5 Stan "No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
"
2 5 Stan "Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"
2 5 Stan "Oh, yeah. Eeww.
"
2 5 Stan "AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "No! I have to get it out!
"
2 5 Stan "ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
"
2 5 Stan "Aw, do we have to?
"
2 5 Stan "Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"
2 5 Stan "Whoa, dude, this is a school? 
"
2 5 Stan "Okay, what have you got?
"
2 5 Stan "Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 
"
2 5 Stan "Chef, we're hungry.
"
2 5 Stan "But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, Chef has lost it.
"
2 5 Stan "Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
"
2 5 Stan "Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
"
2 5 Stan "You don't?
"
2 5 Stan "Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
"
2 5 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
"
2 6 Stan "No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
2 6 Stan "Wow!
"
2 6 Stan """...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.
"
2 6 Stan "From Vietnam veterans.
"
2 6 Stan "No, no, we didn't--
"
2 6 Stan "Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
"
2 6 Stan "For what, dude?
"
2 6 Stan "Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
"
2 6 Stan "How?
"
2 6 Stan "Well, what do you mean?
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 6 Stan "Ready, you guys?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Action! 
"
2 6 Stan "Cut! Cartman!
"
2 6 Stan "It's supposed to be a frog!
"
2 6 Stan "Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Action!
"
2 6 Stan "Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"
2 6 Stan "Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
"
2 6 Stan "It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
"
2 6 Stan "Good. A-and action! 
"
2 6 Stan "They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "They're here! Hurry and hide! 
"
2 6 Stan "Holy crap, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
"
2 6 Stan "We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
2 6 Stan "It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
"
2 6 Stan "Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 
"
2 6 Stan "You big piece of crap!
"
2 6 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
"
2 6 Stan "Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"
2 6 Stan "Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
"
2 6 Stan "No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
"
2 6 Stan "During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
"
2 7 Stan "Give us some, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, the road is always snowy.
"
2 7 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
"
2 7 Stan "Where are we?
"
2 7 Stan "I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude!
"
2 7 Stan "Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"
2 7 Stan "Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
"
2 7 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
2 7 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
"
2 7 Stan "Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
"
2 7 Stan "Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Stan "Do you see 'er dude?
"
2 7 Stan "No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
"
2 7 Stan "What time is it?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
"
2 7 Stan "Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, look!
"
2 7 Stan "Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
"
2 7 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
2 7 Stan "But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
2 7 Stan "What was that?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "We believe in you, Fonz.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh no! 
"
2 7 Stan "Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Hey yeah! 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
"
2 7 Stan "Boy, do I!
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, no! 
"
2 7 Stan "The bus is going over!
"
2 7 Stan "Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"
2 7 Stan "GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
"
2 7 Stan "Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
"
2 8 Stan "Shut up, Pip.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
"
2 8 Stan "I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
"
2 8 Stan "Jesus, Cartman!
"
2 8 Stan "The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"
2 8 Stan "So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
"
2 8 Stan "Heard what?
"
2 8 Stan "How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"
2 8 Stan "Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
"
2 8 Stan "Man, it's hot out here.
"
2 8 Stan "I know! Let's go sledding!
"
2 8 Stan "Come on, Cartman, get on.
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell is going on? 
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
"
2 8 Stan "Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Stan "That's good. 
"
2 8 Stan "Right. 
"
2 8 Stan "Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
2 8 Stan "Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
"
2 8 Stan "Whatever, dude.
"
2 8 Stan "But Cartman, we're trying to--
"
2 8 Stan "What does he mean, ""living in denial""?
"
2 8 Stan "There, how does that look?
"
2 8 Stan "Uh, crap..!
"
2 8 Stan "He's taking swimming lessons.
"
2 8 Stan "How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they need to shut it off.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "Man, this sucks.
"
2 8 Stan "We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"
2 8 Stan "Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
"
2 8 Stan "How many days left in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "There's nothin' to do.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 
"
2 8 Stan "Winter's back!
"
2 8 Stan "Well, I can hardly wait.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, Chef!
"
2 9 Stan "Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
"
2 9 Stan "She's not my girlfriend.
"
2 9 Stan "Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
"
2 9 Stan "Whatcha doin'?
"
2 9 Stan "Calm down, tubby.
"
2 9 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"
2 9 Stan "When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
"
2 9 Stan "They what?!
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, brother.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
"
2 9 Stan "Yeah, pretty much.
"
2 9 Stan "The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 
"
2 9 Stan "Are they good?
"
2 9 Stan "Hey, dude, these are good!
"
2 9 Stan "There is what again? 
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
"
2 9 Stan "To the sewer, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What was that? 
"
2 9 Stan "Mr. Garrison?
"
2 9 Stan "What do you mean?
"
2 9 Stan "Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
"
2 9 Stan "Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
"
2 9 Stan "Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
"
2 9 Stan "Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "So what do we do now?
"
2 9 Stan "Why?
"
2 9 Stan "Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
2 9 Stan "Okay! 
"
2 9 Stan "Sorry.
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
"
2 9 Stan "No problem, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What the hell is he doing?
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
"
2 10 Stan "Ow! 
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
"
2 10 Stan "We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
"
2 10 Stan "Catch what?
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh! Cartman!
"
2 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
"
2 10 Stan "Huh?
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh. 
"
2 10 Stan "Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!
"
2 10 Stan "Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
"
2 10 Stan "Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
2 10 Stan "Okay.
"
2 10 Stan "Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
2 10 Stan "Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 
"
2 10 Stan "No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
"
2 10 Stan "Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
2 10 Stan "That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"
2 10 Stan "Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
"
2 10 Stan "Wait! Where are you going?
"
2 10 Stan "Milkshakes?!
"
2 10 Stan "Weak!
"
2 10 Stan "And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 10 Stan "What are you talking about?
"
2 10 Stan "They did?
"
2 10 Stan "Why?
"
2 10 Stan "Of course!
"
2 10 Stan "Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
"
2 10 Stan "It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
"
2 10 Stan "How does someone get herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
2 10 Stan "And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
"
2 10 Stan "Thanks a lot, Frida!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna go back there.
"
2 10 Stan "Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"
2 10 Stan "You know, freshen up your breath.
"
2 10 Stan "Pretty good.
"
2 10 Stan "Wow, coo-hul!
"
2 10 Stan "We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
"
2 11 Stan "It's boring.
"
2 11 Stan "Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
"
2 11 Stan "This is stupid.
"
2 11 Stan "Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, mine too.
"
2 11 Stan "Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
"
2 11 Stan "Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
"
2 11 Stan "That's a haiku?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh.
"
2 11 Stan "No.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. What's a discharge?
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
"
2 11 Stan "Where have you been, Cartman?
"
2 11 Stan "Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, what just happened?
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, this isn't right.
"
2 11 Stan "We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
"
2 11 Stan "Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
"
2 11 Stan "He hits this switch- 
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I guess so. 
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 11 Stan "This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
"
2 11 Stan "...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, pretty sure.
"
2 11 Stan "What other crime in South Park?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
"
2 11 Stan "Why are you doing this, dude?
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Mackey!
"
2 11 Stan "Get over here and untie us! 
"
2 11 Stan "Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
"
2 12 Stan "Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"
2 12 Stan "Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
"
2 12 Stan "Huh-I dunno.
"
2 12 Stan "Hi, Wendy.
"
2 12 Stan "...No.
"
2 12 Stan "We could?
"
2 12 Stan "But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
"
2 12 Stan "Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
2 12 Stan "We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
"
2 12 Stan "Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "How do we do it?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 
"
2 12 Stan "Dude! 
"
2 12 Stan "Sweet!
"
2 12 Stan "This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
"
2 12 Stan "Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
"
2 12 Stan "Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
2 12 Stan "We're building a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
2 12 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 12 Stan "But Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 12 Stan "Better than yours, fat boy.
"
2 12 Stan "Almost.
"
2 12 Stan "Yes, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 12 Stan "Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
"
2 12 Stan "Phew.
"
2 12 Stan "No, I just--
"
2 12 Stan "I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
"
2 12 Stan "But I didn't write the note!
"
2 12 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Stan "What's 'skylarkings'?
"
2 12 Stan "Who?
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, no. 
"
2 12 Stan "It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
"
2 12 Stan "Excuse me.
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"
2 12 Stan "I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
"
2 12 Stan "My mom won't let us. 
"
2 12 Stan "Pretty good. We're almost done.
"
2 12 Stan "We're going as fast as we can!
"
2 12 Stan "Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
"
2 12 Stan "No.
"
2 12 Stan "I didn't even think about that.
"
2 12 Stan "And I say, ""Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan """Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 12 Stan """Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "You really think so?
"
2 12 Stan "Wow!
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "We're working on it.
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!  Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
"
2 12 Stan "What?! Why?
"
2 12 Stan "Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
"
2 12 Stan "What?!
"
2 12 Stan "This is happening way too fast.
"
2 12 Stan "Okay. We're done.
"
2 12 Stan "It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
"
2 12 Stan "' G'oh?
"
2 12 Stan "Go where?
"
2 12 Stan "But no! I have to get the girls to come-
"
2 12 Stan "Weak!  Dad?
"
2 12 Stan "But I don't understand why we have to--
"
2 12 Stan "Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
"
2 12 Stan "But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
"
2 12 Stan "What? That's it?
"
2 12 Stan "I guess, but-- 
"
2 12 Stan "Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
"
2 12 Stan "No way, dude! Don't be silly.
"
2 12 Stan "We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?
"
2 12 Stan "Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
"
2 12 Stan "To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
"
2 12 Stan "Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
"
2 12 Stan "Dare.
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
"
2 12 Stan "Crap!
"
2 12 Stan "Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
"
2 12 Stan "What?
"
2 12 Stan "My dad lets me watch cartoons.
"
2 12 Stan "Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
2 12 Stan "If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh.
"
2 12 Stan "Divorce is stupid. 
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
"
2 12 Stan "Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
"
2 12 Stan "Dare. 
"
2 12 Stan "...What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
"
2 13 Stan "Really?
"
2 13 Stan "What's that?
"
2 13 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
2 13 Stan "Here we go. 
"
2 13 Stan "What ride?
"
2 13 Stan "My ass we will!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
"
2 13 Stan "We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
"
2 13 Stan "Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"
2 13 Stan "Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
"
2 13 Stan "This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
"
2 13 Stan "He really wants those dolls.
"
2 13 Stan "Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
"
2 13 Stan "We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
"
2 13 Stan "How long was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
"
2 13 Stan "What are you going to do?
"
2 13 Stan "Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
2 13 Stan "Hold on, Cartman!
"
2 13 Stan "Come on, Cartman. 
"
2 13 Stan "You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
"
2 13 Stan "What's the matter with him.
"
2 13 Stan "But can he still ride a bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
"
2 13 Stan "What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
"
2 13 Stan "How's he doing?
"
2 13 Stan "Do you think he can ride the bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cool. 
"
2 13 Stan "Jesus, dude!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hell!
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
"
2 13 Stan "There he is!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
"
2 13 Stan "I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 13 Stan "We did it, dude, we did it! 
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"
2 13 Stan "Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
"
2 13 Stan "We should- 
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
"
2 13 Stan "Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
"
2 13 Stan "Oh-h. Nowhere. 
"
2 14 Stan "But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 14 Stan "What, dude?
"
2 14 Stan "That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello there, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
"
2 14 Stan "You do?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
2 14 Stan "We've gotta help him, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
"
2 14 Stan "Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
"
2 14 Stan "Wow, you remember him?
"
2 14 Stan "So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
"
2 14 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 14 Stan "Thanks, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
"
2 14 Stan "Our friend, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! So you'll help him?
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
"
2 14 Stan "Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"
2 14 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 14 Stan "You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
"
2 14 Stan "No more Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "We can't let him down, you guys.
"
2 14 Stan "Dude, it's over. He's gone.
"
2 14 Stan "No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
2 14 Stan "It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
"
2 14 Stan "Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
"
2 14 Stan "Elton John! What are you doing here?
"
2 14 Stan "Boy, do we!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
"
2 14 Stan "We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
"
2 15 Stan "I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, this is creepy.
"
2 15 Stan "Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 
"
2 15 Stan "Wow!
"
2 15 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 15 Stan "I don't like it. It's spooky.
"
2 15 Stan "Do I have to?
"
2 15 Stan "Damn it! 
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
"
2 15 Stan "Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
"
2 15 Stan "Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!
"
2 15 Stan "Can you leave the light on, Dad?
"
2 15 Stan "I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
2 15 Stan "Where did it go?  Huhhh. 
"
2 15 Stan "Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
"
2 15 Stan "Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
"
2 15 Stan "No!
"
2 15 Stan "AAAAAAAAH! 
"
2 15 Stan "The fish!  But-.
"
2 15 Stan "WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
"
2 15 Stan "You're not gonna get away with this! 
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, what are you doing?
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
"
2 15 Stan "But MOM!
"
2 15 Stan "MMOOMM!
"
2 15 Stan "No, mom!
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping so well.
"
2 15 Stan "Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping well.
"
2 15 Stan "My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
"
2 15 Stan "What are you doing?!
"
2 15 Stan "Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you remember what pet store?
"
2 15 Stan "Where?
"
2 15 Stan "That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
"
2 15 Stan "Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
"
2 15 Stan "It was the fish! 
"
2 15 Stan "Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, we're running out of time. 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, my goldfish-.
"
2 15 Stan "I know.
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
"
2 15 Stan "I wanna return a fish.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, dude.
"
2 15 Stan "So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"
2 15 Stan "We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
"
2 15 Stan "Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
"
2 15 Stan "I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
2 15 Stan "Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah!
"
2 15 Stan "I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"
2 15 Stan "You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
"
2 15 Stan "We won, dude!
"
2 15 Stan "Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
"
2 15 Stan "Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
"
2 15 Stan "Get to the stage! 
"
2 15 Stan "Up yours, evil twin! 
"
2 15 Stan "Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
"
2 15 Stan "Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
"
2 15 Stan "Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"
2 15 Stan "You tricked us, Cartman!
"
2 16 Stan "But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
"
2 16 Stan "But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
"
2 16 Stan "I don't want your lame-ass supper!
"
2 16 Stan "Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
"
2 16 Stan "Okay, let's go!
"
2 16 Stan "'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
"
2 16 Stan "So, how far is it to Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah. Or, we could not.
"
2 16 Stan "This is Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "He's the fat one.
"
2 16 Stan "Sick, dude.
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah, right!
"
2 16 Stan "My family's dead! 
"
2 16 Stan "They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, is he here every year like this?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
2 16 Stan "What, dude? 
"
2 16 Stan "Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
"
2 16 Stan "What was that?
"
2 16 Stan "I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
"
2 16 Stan "We thought you were in jail.
"
2 16 Stan "Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
"
2 16 Stan "All families suck ass!
"
2 16 Stan "Do you really think we should go with this guy?
"
2 16 Stan "Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
"
2 16 Stan "I really like that guy.
"
2 16 Stan "Mr. Hankey? 
"
2 16 Stan "You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, boy. You've done it now.
"
2 16 Stan "Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
"
2 16 Stan "Hey. Where's Kenny?
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, hey Kenny.
"
2 16 Stan "There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
"
2 16 Stan "Oh ooh.
"
2 16 Stan "...Sorry.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
2 16 Stan "'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"
2 16 Stan "Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
2 16 Stan "I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
"
2 16 Stan "What?!
"
2 16 Stan "But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
"
2 16 Stan "I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 
"
2 16 Stan "I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
"
2 16 Stan "Really?
"
2 16 Stan "Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
2 17 Stan "That's okay with us.
"
2 17 Stan "Oh, not Tweek.
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, we can't work with this kid.
"
2 17 Stan "No.
"
2 17 Stan "Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
"
2 17 Stan "Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
"
2 17 Stan "Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"
2 17 Stan "What?
"
2 17 Stan "What gnomes?
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
"
2 17 Stan "'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 17 Stan "Kind of bitter.
"
2 17 Stan "Aooooo!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeess, this stuff rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Whoopee!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
"
2 17 Stan "Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
2 17 Stan "Bad!
"
2 17 Stan "No, we'll use it.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
"
2 17 Stan "Huh??
"
2 17 Stan "Our case?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh... Hooray.
"
2 17 Stan "Uh...
"
2 17 Stan "I like small businesses.
"
2 17 Stan "Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
2 17 Stan "'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, that makes sense.
"
2 17 Stan "How do we stretch that into five minutes?
"
2 17 Stan "What the hell? 
"
2 17 Stan "Hey there, little guy.
"
2 17 Stan "Hey, he talks!
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
"
2 17 Stan "Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
"
2 17 Stan "Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
"
2 17 Stan "I don't get it.
"
2 17 Stan "No you don't, fatass!
"
2 17 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
"
2 17 Stan "Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
"
2 17 Stan "Underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
"
2 17 Stan "Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
"
2 18 Stan "Holy crap. dude!
"
2 18 Stan "This guy rules!
"
2 18 Stan "Yeah! 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude!
"
2 18 Stan "Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
"
2 18 Stan "Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
"
2 18 Stan "Can you climb back up, dude?
"
2 18 Stan "Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
2 18 Stan "Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
"
2 18 Stan "Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
"
2 18 Stan "All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
"
2 18 Stan "He's like, some frozen guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
2 18 Stan "You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
"
2 18 Stan "Help me chip some of the ice away.
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
"
2 18 Stan "Where shall we bring it?
"
2 18 Stan "I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
"
2 18 Stan "You didn't find him, I found him.
"
2 18 Stan "You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh, excuse me?
"
2 18 Stan "I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Stan "Really.
"
2 18 Stan "Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "No, it isn't!
"
2 18 Stan "I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "No, I'll go! I found him!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Uh. Hi.
"
2 18 Stan "He said, ""hi.""
"
2 18 Stan "He wants to know where he is.
"
2 18 Stan "You're... home. 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
2 18 Stan "Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
"
2 18 Stan "Fine! 
"
2 18 Stan "He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
2 18 Stan "I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
"
2 18 Stan "Let him out, dude. He's scared.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"
2 18 Stan "I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here?
"
2 18 Stan "What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
"
2 18 Stan "No he doesn't!!
"
2 18 Stan "I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
"
2 18 Stan "Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
"
2 18 Stan "I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
"
2 18 Stan "Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
"
2 18 Stan "You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Stan "Come on! 
"
2 18 Stan "We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
2 18 Stan "My friend, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
"
2 18 Stan "'K.
"
2 18 Stan "O-okay.
"
2 18 Stan "'K 
"
2 18 Stan "Ow!
"
2 18 Stan "Watch my coat, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh? 
"
2 18 Stan "No problem, Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Yup.
"
2 18 Stan "Right on.
"
2 18 Stan "His... name... is... Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "They're after you! 
"
2 18 Stan "Where's Gorak??
"
2 18 Stan "Wait, look! The helicopter! 
"
2 18 Stan "He's alive!
"
2 18 Stan "Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"
2 2 Stan "Oooh- hey, Kenny.
"
2 2 Stan "Could you pull over so I can get out?
"
2 2 Stan "I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"
2 2 Stan "Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
"
2 2 Stan "Oogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Ooooogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Aghh!
"
2 2 Stan "I'm gotta get outta here!
"
2 2 Stan "Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh, weak. 
"
2 2 Stan "Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
"
2 2 Stan "No way, dude!
"
2 2 Stan "No.
"
2 2 Stan "Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 2 Stan "He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
"
2 3 Stan "If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
2 3 Stan "Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
"
2 3 Stan "Hey, what's this? 
"
2 3 Stan "Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
"
2 3 Stan "I can't see, dude!
"
2 3 Stan "No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
2 3 Stan "Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, never mind. 
"
2 3 Stan "It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 3 Stan """If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".
"
2 3 Stan "I.
"
2 3 Stan "A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
"
2 3 Stan "Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
"
2 3 Stan "What's it say? What's it say?
"
2 3 Stan "I dunno.
"
2 3 Stan "Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
"
2 3 Stan "Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
"
2 3 Stan "Look! 
"
2 3 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Goddammit!
"
2 3 Stan "Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "What are you talking about, dude?!
"
2 3 Stan "That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey! So what are you going to do now?
"
2 3 Stan "They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
"
2 3 Stan "I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
"
2 4 Stan "Booooo!
"
2 4 Stan "I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Why do dogs have cold noses?
"
2 4 Stan "Oh.
"
2 4 Stan "Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
"
2 4 Stan "Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
"
2 4 Stan "Well, dude, you better find out!
"
2 4 Stan "Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
"
2 4 Stan "No, dude, we never even saw it!
"
2 4 Stan "We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
"
2 4 Stan "What do ya mean?
"
2 4 Stan "Ahhh, bicycles?
"
2 4 Stan "Your eyes? 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
"
2 4 Stan "Kyle! You have to stop them!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
2 4 Stan "They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
"
2 4 Stan "What are you goin' to do, dude?
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
"
2 4 Stan "Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
2 4 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 4 Stan "Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
"
2 4 Stan "Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
"
2 4 Stan "Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 4 Stan "Naturally.
"
2 4 Stan "You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
"
2 4 Stan "Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 5 Stan "Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
"
2 5 Stan "If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
"
2 5 Stan "Dammit, we lost one already!
"
2 5 Stan "Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 
"
2 5 Stan "We're losing men fast out here! 
"
2 5 Stan "No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
"
2 5 Stan "Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"
2 5 Stan "Oh, yeah. Eeww.
"
2 5 Stan "AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "No! I have to get it out!
"
2 5 Stan "ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
"
2 5 Stan "Aw, do we have to?
"
2 5 Stan "Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"
2 5 Stan "Whoa, dude, this is a school? 
"
2 5 Stan "Okay, what have you got?
"
2 5 Stan "Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 
"
2 5 Stan "Chef, we're hungry.
"
2 5 Stan "But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, Chef has lost it.
"
2 5 Stan "Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
"
2 5 Stan "Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
"
2 5 Stan "You don't?
"
2 5 Stan "Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
"
2 5 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
"
2 6 Stan "No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
2 6 Stan "Wow!
"
2 6 Stan """...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.
"
2 6 Stan "From Vietnam veterans.
"
2 6 Stan "No, no, we didn't--
"
2 6 Stan "Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
"
2 6 Stan "For what, dude?
"
2 6 Stan "Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
"
2 6 Stan "How?
"
2 6 Stan "Well, what do you mean?
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 6 Stan "Ready, you guys?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Action! 
"
2 6 Stan "Cut! Cartman!
"
2 6 Stan "It's supposed to be a frog!
"
2 6 Stan "Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Action!
"
2 6 Stan "Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"
2 6 Stan "Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
"
2 6 Stan "It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
"
2 6 Stan "Good. A-and action! 
"
2 6 Stan "They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "They're here! Hurry and hide! 
"
2 6 Stan "Holy crap, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
"
2 6 Stan "We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
2 6 Stan "It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
"
2 6 Stan "Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 
"
2 6 Stan "You big piece of crap!
"
2 6 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
"
2 6 Stan "Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"
2 6 Stan "Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
"
2 6 Stan "No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
"
2 6 Stan "During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
"
2 7 Stan "Give us some, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, the road is always snowy.
"
2 7 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
"
2 7 Stan "Where are we?
"
2 7 Stan "I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude!
"
2 7 Stan "Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"
2 7 Stan "Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
"
2 7 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
2 7 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
"
2 7 Stan "Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
"
2 7 Stan "Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Stan "Do you see 'er dude?
"
2 7 Stan "No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
"
2 7 Stan "What time is it?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
"
2 7 Stan "Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, look!
"
2 7 Stan "Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
"
2 7 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
2 7 Stan "But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
2 7 Stan "What was that?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "We believe in you, Fonz.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh no! 
"
2 7 Stan "Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Hey yeah! 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
"
2 7 Stan "Boy, do I!
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, no! 
"
2 7 Stan "The bus is going over!
"
2 7 Stan "Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"
2 7 Stan "GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
"
2 7 Stan "Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
"
2 8 Stan "Shut up, Pip.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
"
2 8 Stan "I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
"
2 8 Stan "Jesus, Cartman!
"
2 8 Stan "The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"
2 8 Stan "So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
"
2 8 Stan "Heard what?
"
2 8 Stan "How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"
2 8 Stan "Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
"
2 8 Stan "Man, it's hot out here.
"
2 8 Stan "I know! Let's go sledding!
"
2 8 Stan "Come on, Cartman, get on.
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell is going on? 
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
"
2 8 Stan "Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Stan "That's good. 
"
2 8 Stan "Right. 
"
2 8 Stan "Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
2 8 Stan "Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
"
2 8 Stan "Whatever, dude.
"
2 8 Stan "But Cartman, we're trying to--
"
2 8 Stan "What does he mean, ""living in denial""?
"
2 8 Stan "There, how does that look?
"
2 8 Stan "Uh, crap..!
"
2 8 Stan "He's taking swimming lessons.
"
2 8 Stan "How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they need to shut it off.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "Man, this sucks.
"
2 8 Stan "We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"
2 8 Stan "Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
"
2 8 Stan "How many days left in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "There's nothin' to do.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 
"
2 8 Stan "Winter's back!
"
2 8 Stan "Well, I can hardly wait.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, Chef!
"
2 9 Stan "Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
"
2 9 Stan "She's not my girlfriend.
"
2 9 Stan "Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
"
2 9 Stan "Whatcha doin'?
"
2 9 Stan "Calm down, tubby.
"
2 9 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"
2 9 Stan "When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
"
2 9 Stan "They what?!
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, brother.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
"
2 9 Stan "Yeah, pretty much.
"
2 9 Stan "The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 
"
2 9 Stan "Are they good?
"
2 9 Stan "Hey, dude, these are good!
"
2 9 Stan "There is what again? 
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
"
2 9 Stan "To the sewer, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What was that? 
"
2 9 Stan "Mr. Garrison?
"
2 9 Stan "What do you mean?
"
2 9 Stan "Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
"
2 9 Stan "Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
"
2 9 Stan "Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
"
2 9 Stan "Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "So what do we do now?
"
2 9 Stan "Why?
"
2 9 Stan "Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
2 9 Stan "Okay! 
"
2 9 Stan "Sorry.
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
"
2 9 Stan "No problem, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What the hell is he doing?
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
"
2 10 Stan "Ow! 
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
"
2 10 Stan "We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
"
2 10 Stan "Catch what?
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh! Cartman!
"
2 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
"
2 10 Stan "Huh?
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh. 
"
2 10 Stan "Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!
"
2 10 Stan "Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
"
2 10 Stan "Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
2 10 Stan "Okay.
"
2 10 Stan "Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
2 10 Stan "Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 
"
2 10 Stan "No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
"
2 10 Stan "Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
2 10 Stan "That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"
2 10 Stan "Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
"
2 10 Stan "Wait! Where are you going?
"
2 10 Stan "Milkshakes?!
"
2 10 Stan "Weak!
"
2 10 Stan "And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 10 Stan "What are you talking about?
"
2 10 Stan "They did?
"
2 10 Stan "Why?
"
2 10 Stan "Of course!
"
2 10 Stan "Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
"
2 10 Stan "It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
"
2 10 Stan "How does someone get herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
2 10 Stan "And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
"
2 10 Stan "Thanks a lot, Frida!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna go back there.
"
2 10 Stan "Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"
2 10 Stan "You know, freshen up your breath.
"
2 10 Stan "Pretty good.
"
2 10 Stan "Wow, coo-hul!
"
2 10 Stan "We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
"
2 11 Stan "It's boring.
"
2 11 Stan "Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
"
2 11 Stan "This is stupid.
"
2 11 Stan "Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, mine too.
"
2 11 Stan "Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
"
2 11 Stan "Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
"
2 11 Stan "That's a haiku?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh.
"
2 11 Stan "No.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. What's a discharge?
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
"
2 11 Stan "Where have you been, Cartman?
"
2 11 Stan "Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, what just happened?
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, this isn't right.
"
2 11 Stan "We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
"
2 11 Stan "Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
"
2 11 Stan "He hits this switch- 
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I guess so. 
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 11 Stan "This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
"
2 11 Stan "...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, pretty sure.
"
2 11 Stan "What other crime in South Park?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
"
2 11 Stan "Why are you doing this, dude?
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Mackey!
"
2 11 Stan "Get over here and untie us! 
"
2 11 Stan "Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
"
2 12 Stan "Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"
2 12 Stan "Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
"
2 12 Stan "Huh-I dunno.
"
2 12 Stan "Hi, Wendy.
"
2 12 Stan "...No.
"
2 12 Stan "We could?
"
2 12 Stan "But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
"
2 12 Stan "Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
2 12 Stan "We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
"
2 12 Stan "Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "How do we do it?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 
"
2 12 Stan "Dude! 
"
2 12 Stan "Sweet!
"
2 12 Stan "This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
"
2 12 Stan "Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
"
2 12 Stan "Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
2 12 Stan "We're building a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
2 12 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 12 Stan "But Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 12 Stan "Better than yours, fat boy.
"
2 12 Stan "Almost.
"
2 12 Stan "Yes, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 12 Stan "Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
"
2 12 Stan "Phew.
"
2 12 Stan "No, I just--
"
2 12 Stan "I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
"
2 12 Stan "But I didn't write the note!
"
2 12 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Stan "What's 'skylarkings'?
"
2 12 Stan "Who?
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, no. 
"
2 12 Stan "It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
"
2 12 Stan "Excuse me.
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"
2 12 Stan "I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
"
2 12 Stan "My mom won't let us. 
"
2 12 Stan "Pretty good. We're almost done.
"
2 12 Stan "We're going as fast as we can!
"
2 12 Stan "Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
"
2 12 Stan "No.
"
2 12 Stan "I didn't even think about that.
"
2 12 Stan "And I say, ""Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan """Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 12 Stan """Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "You really think so?
"
2 12 Stan "Wow!
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "We're working on it.
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!  Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
"
2 12 Stan "What?! Why?
"
2 12 Stan "Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
"
2 12 Stan "What?!
"
2 12 Stan "This is happening way too fast.
"
2 12 Stan "Okay. We're done.
"
2 12 Stan "It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
"
2 12 Stan "' G'oh?
"
2 12 Stan "Go where?
"
2 12 Stan "But no! I have to get the girls to come-
"
2 12 Stan "Weak!  Dad?
"
2 12 Stan "But I don't understand why we have to--
"
2 12 Stan "Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
"
2 12 Stan "But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
"
2 12 Stan "What? That's it?
"
2 12 Stan "I guess, but-- 
"
2 12 Stan "Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
"
2 12 Stan "No way, dude! Don't be silly.
"
2 12 Stan "We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?
"
2 12 Stan "Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
"
2 12 Stan "To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
"
2 12 Stan "Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
"
2 12 Stan "Dare.
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
"
2 12 Stan "Crap!
"
2 12 Stan "Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
"
2 12 Stan "What?
"
2 12 Stan "My dad lets me watch cartoons.
"
2 12 Stan "Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
2 12 Stan "If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh.
"
2 12 Stan "Divorce is stupid. 
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
"
2 12 Stan "Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
"
2 12 Stan "Dare. 
"
2 12 Stan "...What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
"
2 13 Stan "Really?
"
2 13 Stan "What's that?
"
2 13 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
2 13 Stan "Here we go. 
"
2 13 Stan "What ride?
"
2 13 Stan "My ass we will!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
"
2 13 Stan "We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
"
2 13 Stan "Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"
2 13 Stan "Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
"
2 13 Stan "This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
"
2 13 Stan "He really wants those dolls.
"
2 13 Stan "Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
"
2 13 Stan "We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
"
2 13 Stan "How long was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
"
2 13 Stan "What are you going to do?
"
2 13 Stan "Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
2 13 Stan "Hold on, Cartman!
"
2 13 Stan "Come on, Cartman. 
"
2 13 Stan "You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
"
2 13 Stan "What's the matter with him.
"
2 13 Stan "But can he still ride a bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
"
2 13 Stan "What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
"
2 13 Stan "How's he doing?
"
2 13 Stan "Do you think he can ride the bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cool. 
"
2 13 Stan "Jesus, dude!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hell!
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
"
2 13 Stan "There he is!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
"
2 13 Stan "I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 13 Stan "We did it, dude, we did it! 
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"
2 13 Stan "Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
"
2 13 Stan "We should- 
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
"
2 13 Stan "Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
"
2 13 Stan "Oh-h. Nowhere. 
"
2 14 Stan "But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 14 Stan "What, dude?
"
2 14 Stan "That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello there, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
"
2 14 Stan "You do?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
2 14 Stan "We've gotta help him, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
"
2 14 Stan "Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
"
2 14 Stan "Wow, you remember him?
"
2 14 Stan "So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
"
2 14 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 14 Stan "Thanks, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
"
2 14 Stan "Our friend, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! So you'll help him?
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
"
2 14 Stan "Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"
2 14 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 14 Stan "You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
"
2 14 Stan "No more Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "We can't let him down, you guys.
"
2 14 Stan "Dude, it's over. He's gone.
"
2 14 Stan "No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
2 14 Stan "It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
"
2 14 Stan "Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
"
2 14 Stan "Elton John! What are you doing here?
"
2 14 Stan "Boy, do we!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
"
2 14 Stan "We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
"
2 15 Stan "I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, this is creepy.
"
2 15 Stan "Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 
"
2 15 Stan "Wow!
"
2 15 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 15 Stan "I don't like it. It's spooky.
"
2 15 Stan "Do I have to?
"
2 15 Stan "Damn it! 
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
"
2 15 Stan "Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
"
2 15 Stan "Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!
"
2 15 Stan "Can you leave the light on, Dad?
"
2 15 Stan "I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
2 15 Stan "Where did it go?  Huhhh. 
"
2 15 Stan "Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
"
2 15 Stan "Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
"
2 15 Stan "No!
"
2 15 Stan "AAAAAAAAH! 
"
2 15 Stan "The fish!  But-.
"
2 15 Stan "WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
"
2 15 Stan "You're not gonna get away with this! 
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, what are you doing?
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
"
2 15 Stan "But MOM!
"
2 15 Stan "MMOOMM!
"
2 15 Stan "No, mom!
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping so well.
"
2 15 Stan "Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping well.
"
2 15 Stan "My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
"
2 15 Stan "What are you doing?!
"
2 15 Stan "Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you remember what pet store?
"
2 15 Stan "Where?
"
2 15 Stan "That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
"
2 15 Stan "Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
"
2 15 Stan "It was the fish! 
"
2 15 Stan "Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, we're running out of time. 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, my goldfish-.
"
2 15 Stan "I know.
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
"
2 15 Stan "I wanna return a fish.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, dude.
"
2 15 Stan "So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"
2 15 Stan "We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
"
2 15 Stan "Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
"
2 15 Stan "I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
2 15 Stan "Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah!
"
2 15 Stan "I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"
2 15 Stan "You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
"
2 15 Stan "We won, dude!
"
2 15 Stan "Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
"
2 15 Stan "Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
"
2 15 Stan "Get to the stage! 
"
2 15 Stan "Up yours, evil twin! 
"
2 15 Stan "Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
"
2 15 Stan "Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
"
2 15 Stan "Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"
2 15 Stan "You tricked us, Cartman!
"
2 16 Stan "But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
"
2 16 Stan "But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
"
2 16 Stan "I don't want your lame-ass supper!
"
2 16 Stan "Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
"
2 16 Stan "Okay, let's go!
"
2 16 Stan "'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
"
2 16 Stan "So, how far is it to Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah. Or, we could not.
"
2 16 Stan "This is Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "He's the fat one.
"
2 16 Stan "Sick, dude.
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah, right!
"
2 16 Stan "My family's dead! 
"
2 16 Stan "They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, is he here every year like this?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
2 16 Stan "What, dude? 
"
2 16 Stan "Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
"
2 16 Stan "What was that?
"
2 16 Stan "I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
"
2 16 Stan "We thought you were in jail.
"
2 16 Stan "Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
"
2 16 Stan "All families suck ass!
"
2 16 Stan "Do you really think we should go with this guy?
"
2 16 Stan "Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
"
2 16 Stan "I really like that guy.
"
2 16 Stan "Mr. Hankey? 
"
2 16 Stan "You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, boy. You've done it now.
"
2 16 Stan "Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
"
2 16 Stan "Hey. Where's Kenny?
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, hey Kenny.
"
2 16 Stan "There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
"
2 16 Stan "Oh ooh.
"
2 16 Stan "...Sorry.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
2 16 Stan "'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"
2 16 Stan "Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
2 16 Stan "I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
"
2 16 Stan "What?!
"
2 16 Stan "But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
"
2 16 Stan "I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 
"
2 16 Stan "I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
"
2 16 Stan "Really?
"
2 16 Stan "Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
2 17 Stan "That's okay with us.
"
2 17 Stan "Oh, not Tweek.
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, we can't work with this kid.
"
2 17 Stan "No.
"
2 17 Stan "Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
"
2 17 Stan "Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
"
2 17 Stan "Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"
2 17 Stan "What?
"
2 17 Stan "What gnomes?
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
"
2 17 Stan "'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 17 Stan "Kind of bitter.
"
2 17 Stan "Aooooo!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeess, this stuff rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Whoopee!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
"
2 17 Stan "Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
2 17 Stan "Bad!
"
2 17 Stan "No, we'll use it.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
"
2 17 Stan "Huh??
"
2 17 Stan "Our case?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh... Hooray.
"
2 17 Stan "Uh...
"
2 17 Stan "I like small businesses.
"
2 17 Stan "Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
2 17 Stan "'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, that makes sense.
"
2 17 Stan "How do we stretch that into five minutes?
"
2 17 Stan "What the hell? 
"
2 17 Stan "Hey there, little guy.
"
2 17 Stan "Hey, he talks!
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
"
2 17 Stan "Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
"
2 17 Stan "Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
"
2 17 Stan "I don't get it.
"
2 17 Stan "No you don't, fatass!
"
2 17 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
"
2 17 Stan "Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
"
2 17 Stan "Underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
"
2 17 Stan "Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
"
2 18 Stan "Holy crap. dude!
"
2 18 Stan "This guy rules!
"
2 18 Stan "Yeah! 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude!
"
2 18 Stan "Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
"
2 18 Stan "Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
"
2 18 Stan "Can you climb back up, dude?
"
2 18 Stan "Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
2 18 Stan "Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
"
2 18 Stan "Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
"
2 18 Stan "All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
"
2 18 Stan "He's like, some frozen guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
2 18 Stan "You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
"
2 18 Stan "Help me chip some of the ice away.
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
"
2 18 Stan "Where shall we bring it?
"
2 18 Stan "I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
"
2 18 Stan "You didn't find him, I found him.
"
2 18 Stan "You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh, excuse me?
"
2 18 Stan "I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Stan "Really.
"
2 18 Stan "Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "No, it isn't!
"
2 18 Stan "I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "No, I'll go! I found him!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Uh. Hi.
"
2 18 Stan "He said, ""hi.""
"
2 18 Stan "He wants to know where he is.
"
2 18 Stan "You're... home. 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
2 18 Stan "Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
"
2 18 Stan "Fine! 
"
2 18 Stan "He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
2 18 Stan "I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
"
2 18 Stan "Let him out, dude. He's scared.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"
2 18 Stan "I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here?
"
2 18 Stan "What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
"
2 18 Stan "No he doesn't!!
"
2 18 Stan "I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
"
2 18 Stan "Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
"
2 18 Stan "I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
"
2 18 Stan "Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
"
2 18 Stan "You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Stan "Come on! 
"
2 18 Stan "We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
2 18 Stan "My friend, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
"
2 18 Stan "'K.
"
2 18 Stan "O-okay.
"
2 18 Stan "'K 
"
2 18 Stan "Ow!
"
2 18 Stan "Watch my coat, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh? 
"
2 18 Stan "No problem, Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Yup.
"
2 18 Stan "Right on.
"
2 18 Stan "His... name... is... Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "They're after you! 
"
2 18 Stan "Where's Gorak??
"
2 18 Stan "Wait, look! The helicopter! 
"
2 18 Stan "He's alive!
"
2 18 Stan "Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"
2 2 Stan "Oooh- hey, Kenny.
"
2 2 Stan "Could you pull over so I can get out?
"
2 2 Stan "I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"
2 2 Stan "Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
"
2 2 Stan "Oogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Ooooogh.
"
2 2 Stan "Aghh!
"
2 2 Stan "I'm gotta get outta here!
"
2 2 Stan "Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh, weak. 
"
2 2 Stan "Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
"
2 2 Stan "No way, dude!
"
2 2 Stan "No.
"
2 2 Stan "Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
2 2 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 2 Stan "He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
"
2 2 Stan "Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
"
2 3 Stan "If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
2 3 Stan "Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
"
2 3 Stan "Hey, what's this? 
"
2 3 Stan "Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
"
2 3 Stan "I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
"
2 3 Stan "I can't see, dude!
"
2 3 Stan "No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
2 3 Stan "Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Oh, never mind. 
"
2 3 Stan "It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 3 Stan """If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".
"
2 3 Stan "I.
"
2 3 Stan "A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
"
2 3 Stan "Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
"
2 3 Stan "What's it say? What's it say?
"
2 3 Stan "I dunno.
"
2 3 Stan "Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
"
2 3 Stan "Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
"
2 3 Stan "Look! 
"
2 3 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed--
"
2 3 Stan "Goddammit!
"
2 3 Stan "Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "What are you talking about, dude?!
"
2 3 Stan "That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
"
2 3 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 3 Stan "Hey! So what are you going to do now?
"
2 3 Stan "They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
"
2 3 Stan "I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
"
2 4 Stan "Booooo!
"
2 4 Stan "I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Why do dogs have cold noses?
"
2 4 Stan "Oh.
"
2 4 Stan "Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
"
2 4 Stan "Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
"
2 4 Stan "Well, dude, you better find out!
"
2 4 Stan "Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2 4 Stan "Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
"
2 4 Stan "No, dude, we never even saw it!
"
2 4 Stan "We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
"
2 4 Stan "What do ya mean?
"
2 4 Stan "Ahhh, bicycles?
"
2 4 Stan "Your eyes? 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
"
2 4 Stan "Kyle! You have to stop them!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
2 4 Stan "They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
"
2 4 Stan "What are you goin' to do, dude?
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
"
2 4 Stan "Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
2 4 Stan "Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
2 4 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 4 Stan "Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
"
2 4 Stan "Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
"
2 4 Stan "Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
"
2 4 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 4 Stan "Naturally.
"
2 4 Stan "You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
"
2 4 Stan "Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 5 Stan "Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
"
2 5 Stan "If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
"
2 5 Stan "Dammit, we lost one already!
"
2 5 Stan "Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 
"
2 5 Stan "We're losing men fast out here! 
"
2 5 Stan "No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
"
2 5 Stan "Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"
2 5 Stan "Oh, yeah. Eeww.
"
2 5 Stan "AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "No! I have to get it out!
"
2 5 Stan "ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
"
2 5 Stan "Aw, do we have to?
"
2 5 Stan "Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"
2 5 Stan "Whoa, dude, this is a school? 
"
2 5 Stan "Okay, what have you got?
"
2 5 Stan "Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 
"
2 5 Stan "Chef, we're hungry.
"
2 5 Stan "But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, Chef has lost it.
"
2 5 Stan "Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
"
2 5 Stan "Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
"
2 5 Stan "You don't?
"
2 5 Stan "Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
"
2 5 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
"
2 5 Stan "Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
2 5 Stan "Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
"
2 6 Stan "No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa!
"
2 6 Stan "Wow!
"
2 6 Stan """...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.
"
2 6 Stan "From Vietnam veterans.
"
2 6 Stan "No, no, we didn't--
"
2 6 Stan "Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
"
2 6 Stan "For what, dude?
"
2 6 Stan "Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
"
2 6 Stan "How?
"
2 6 Stan "Well, what do you mean?
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 6 Stan "Ready, you guys?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Action! 
"
2 6 Stan "Cut! Cartman!
"
2 6 Stan "It's supposed to be a frog!
"
2 6 Stan "Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
2 6 Stan "Action!
"
2 6 Stan "Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"
2 6 Stan "Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
"
2 6 Stan "It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
"
2 6 Stan "Good. A-and action! 
"
2 6 Stan "They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "They're here! Hurry and hide! 
"
2 6 Stan "Holy crap, dude.
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
"
2 6 Stan "Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
"
2 6 Stan "We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
2 6 Stan "Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
2 6 Stan "It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"
2 6 Stan "Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
"
2 6 Stan "Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 
"
2 6 Stan "You big piece of crap!
"
2 6 Stan "Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
"
2 6 Stan "Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"
2 6 Stan "Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
"
2 6 Stan "No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
"
2 6 Stan "During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
"
2 6 Stan "W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
"
2 7 Stan "Give us some, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, the road is always snowy.
"
2 7 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
"
2 7 Stan "Where are we?
"
2 7 Stan "I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
"
2 7 Stan "Dude!
"
2 7 Stan "Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"
2 7 Stan "Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
"
2 7 Stan "I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
2 7 Stan "Come on Cartman, fart!
"
2 7 Stan "He can't hold it in forever.
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
"
2 7 Stan "Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
"
2 7 Stan "Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Stan "Do you see 'er dude?
"
2 7 Stan "No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
"
2 7 Stan "What time is it?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
"
2 7 Stan "Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "Hey, look!
"
2 7 Stan "Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
"
2 7 Stan "Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
2 7 Stan "But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
2 7 Stan "What was that?
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
"
2 7 Stan "What?
"
2 7 Stan "We believe in you, Fonz.
"
2 7 Stan "Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2 7 Stan "You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
2 7 Stan "Oh no! 
"
2 7 Stan "Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
"
2 7 Stan "I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
"
2 7 Stan "Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2 7 Stan "Hey yeah! 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
"
2 7 Stan "Boy, do I!
"
2 7 Stan "Cartman, no! 
"
2 7 Stan "The bus is going over!
"
2 7 Stan "Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"
2 7 Stan "GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
"
2 7 Stan "Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
2 7 Stan "Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
"
2 7 Stan "Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
"
2 8 Stan "Shut up, Pip.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
"
2 8 Stan "I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
"
2 8 Stan "Jesus, Cartman!
"
2 8 Stan "The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"
2 8 Stan "So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
"
2 8 Stan "Heard what?
"
2 8 Stan "How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"
2 8 Stan "Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
"
2 8 Stan "Man, it's hot out here.
"
2 8 Stan "I know! Let's go sledding!
"
2 8 Stan "Come on, Cartman, get on.
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "What the hell is going on? 
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
"
2 8 Stan "Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Stan "That's good. 
"
2 8 Stan "Right. 
"
2 8 Stan "Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
2 8 Stan "Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
"
2 8 Stan "Whatever, dude.
"
2 8 Stan "But Cartman, we're trying to--
"
2 8 Stan "What does he mean, ""living in denial""?
"
2 8 Stan "There, how does that look?
"
2 8 Stan "Uh, crap..!
"
2 8 Stan "He's taking swimming lessons.
"
2 8 Stan "How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
"
2 8 Stan "Yeah, they need to shut it off.
"
2 8 Stan "Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
"
2 8 Stan "Man, this sucks.
"
2 8 Stan "We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"
2 8 Stan "Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
"
2 8 Stan "How many days left in summer?
"
2 8 Stan "Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"
2 8 Stan "Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2 8 Stan "There's nothin' to do.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 
"
2 8 Stan "Winter's back!
"
2 8 Stan "Well, I can hardly wait.
"
2 8 Stan "Hey, Chef!
"
2 9 Stan "Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
"
2 9 Stan "She's not my girlfriend.
"
2 9 Stan "Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
"
2 9 Stan "Whatcha doin'?
"
2 9 Stan "Calm down, tubby.
"
2 9 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"
2 9 Stan "When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
"
2 9 Stan "They what?!
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, brother.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Dude!
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
"
2 9 Stan "Yeah, pretty much.
"
2 9 Stan "The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 
"
2 9 Stan "Are they good?
"
2 9 Stan "Hey, dude, these are good!
"
2 9 Stan "There is what again? 
"
2 9 Stan "Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
"
2 9 Stan "To the sewer, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What was that? 
"
2 9 Stan "Mr. Garrison?
"
2 9 Stan "What do you mean?
"
2 9 Stan "Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
"
2 9 Stan "Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
"
2 9 Stan "Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
"
2 9 Stan "Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
"
2 9 Stan "So what do we do now?
"
2 9 Stan "Why?
"
2 9 Stan "Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
2 9 Stan "Okay! 
"
2 9 Stan "Sorry.
"
2 9 Stan "Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
"
2 9 Stan "No problem, dude.
"
2 9 Stan "What the hell is he doing?
"
2 9 Stan "Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
"
2 10 Stan "Ow! 
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
"
2 10 Stan "We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
"
2 10 Stan "Catch what?
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh! Cartman!
"
2 10 Stan "Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
"
2 10 Stan "Huh?
"
2 10 Stan "Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh. 
"
2 10 Stan "Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!
"
2 10 Stan "Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
"
2 10 Stan "Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
2 10 Stan "Okay.
"
2 10 Stan "Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
2 10 Stan "Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 
"
2 10 Stan "No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
"
2 10 Stan "Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
2 10 Stan "That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"
2 10 Stan "Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
"
2 10 Stan "Wait! Where are you going?
"
2 10 Stan "Milkshakes?!
"
2 10 Stan "Weak!
"
2 10 Stan "And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
"
2 10 Stan "Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
"
2 10 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 10 Stan "What are you talking about?
"
2 10 Stan "They did?
"
2 10 Stan "Why?
"
2 10 Stan "Of course!
"
2 10 Stan "Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
"
2 10 Stan "It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
"
2 10 Stan "How does someone get herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"
2 10 Stan "My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
2 10 Stan "And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
"
2 10 Stan "Thanks a lot, Frida!
"
2 10 Stan "I don't wanna go back there.
"
2 10 Stan "Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"
2 10 Stan "You know, freshen up your breath.
"
2 10 Stan "Pretty good.
"
2 10 Stan "Wow, coo-hul!
"
2 10 Stan "We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"
2 10 Stan "Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
"
2 11 Stan "It's boring.
"
2 11 Stan "Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
"
2 11 Stan "This is stupid.
"
2 11 Stan "Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, mine too.
"
2 11 Stan "Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
"
2 11 Stan "Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
"
2 11 Stan "That's a haiku?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh.
"
2 11 Stan "No.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. What's a discharge?
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
"
2 11 Stan "Where have you been, Cartman?
"
2 11 Stan "Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, what just happened?
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, this isn't right.
"
2 11 Stan "We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
"
2 11 Stan "Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
"
2 11 Stan "Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
"
2 11 Stan "He hits this switch- 
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, I guess so. 
"
2 11 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 11 Stan "This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
"
2 11 Stan "Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
"
2 11 Stan "...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah, pretty sure.
"
2 11 Stan "What other crime in South Park?
"
2 11 Stan "Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
"
2 11 Stan "Why are you doing this, dude?
"
2 11 Stan "Mr. Mackey!
"
2 11 Stan "Get over here and untie us! 
"
2 11 Stan "Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
2 11 Stan "Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
"
2 12 Stan "Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"
2 12 Stan "Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
"
2 12 Stan "Huh-I dunno.
"
2 12 Stan "Hi, Wendy.
"
2 12 Stan "...No.
"
2 12 Stan "We could?
"
2 12 Stan "But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
"
2 12 Stan "Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
2 12 Stan "We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
"
2 12 Stan "Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "How do we do it?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 
"
2 12 Stan "Dude! 
"
2 12 Stan "Sweet!
"
2 12 Stan "This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
"
2 12 Stan "Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
"
2 12 Stan "Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
2 12 Stan "We're building a clubhouse.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Fine!
"
2 12 Stan "Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
2 12 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 12 Stan "But Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 12 Stan "Better than yours, fat boy.
"
2 12 Stan "Almost.
"
2 12 Stan "Yes, Mr. Garrison.
"
2 12 Stan "Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
"
2 12 Stan "Phew.
"
2 12 Stan "No, I just--
"
2 12 Stan "I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
"
2 12 Stan "But I didn't write the note!
"
2 12 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Stan "What's 'skylarkings'?
"
2 12 Stan "Who?
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, no. 
"
2 12 Stan "It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
"
2 12 Stan "Excuse me.
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"
2 12 Stan "I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
"
2 12 Stan "My mom won't let us. 
"
2 12 Stan "Pretty good. We're almost done.
"
2 12 Stan "We're going as fast as we can!
"
2 12 Stan "Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
"
2 12 Stan "No.
"
2 12 Stan "I didn't even think about that.
"
2 12 Stan "And I say, ""Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan """Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 12 Stan """Dare!""
"
2 12 Stan "Oooh.
"
2 12 Stan "You really think so?
"
2 12 Stan "Wow!
"
2 12 Stan "Hello?
"
2 12 Stan "We're working on it.
"
2 12 Stan "No, you don't!  Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
"
2 12 Stan "What?! Why?
"
2 12 Stan "Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
"
2 12 Stan "What?!
"
2 12 Stan "This is happening way too fast.
"
2 12 Stan "Okay. We're done.
"
2 12 Stan "It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
"
2 12 Stan "' G'oh?
"
2 12 Stan "Go where?
"
2 12 Stan "But no! I have to get the girls to come-
"
2 12 Stan "Weak!  Dad?
"
2 12 Stan "But I don't understand why we have to--
"
2 12 Stan "Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
"
2 12 Stan "But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
"
2 12 Stan "What? That's it?
"
2 12 Stan "I guess, but-- 
"
2 12 Stan "Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
"
2 12 Stan "No way, dude! Don't be silly.
"
2 12 Stan "We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?
"
2 12 Stan "Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
"
2 12 Stan "To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.
"
2 12 Stan "Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
"
2 12 Stan "Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude!
"
2 12 Stan "Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
"
2 12 Stan "Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
"
2 12 Stan "Dare.
"
2 12 Stan "...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
"
2 12 Stan "Crap!
"
2 12 Stan "Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
"
2 12 Stan "What?
"
2 12 Stan "My dad lets me watch cartoons.
"
2 12 Stan "Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
2 12 Stan "If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
"
2 12 Stan "Oh.
"
2 12 Stan "Divorce is stupid. 
"
2 12 Stan "Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
"
2 12 Stan "Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
"
2 12 Stan "Dare. 
"
2 12 Stan "...What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
"
2 13 Stan "Really?
"
2 13 Stan "What's that?
"
2 13 Stan "What the hell was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
2 13 Stan "Here we go. 
"
2 13 Stan "What ride?
"
2 13 Stan "My ass we will!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
"
2 13 Stan "We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
"
2 13 Stan "Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"
2 13 Stan "Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
"
2 13 Stan "This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
"
2 13 Stan "He really wants those dolls.
"
2 13 Stan "Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
"
2 13 Stan "We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
"
2 13 Stan "How long was that?
"
2 13 Stan "Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
"
2 13 Stan "What are you going to do?
"
2 13 Stan "Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
2 13 Stan "Hold on, Cartman!
"
2 13 Stan "Come on, Cartman. 
"
2 13 Stan "You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
"
2 13 Stan "What's the matter with him.
"
2 13 Stan "But can he still ride a bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
"
2 13 Stan "What?!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
"
2 13 Stan "How's he doing?
"
2 13 Stan "Do you think he can ride the bull?
"
2 13 Stan "Cool. 
"
2 13 Stan "Jesus, dude!
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hell!
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
"
2 13 Stan "Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
"
2 13 Stan "There he is!
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
"
2 13 Stan "I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2 13 Stan "We did it, dude, we did it! 
"
2 13 Stan "Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"
2 13 Stan "Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
"
2 13 Stan "We should- 
"
2 13 Stan "Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
"
2 13 Stan "Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Stan "Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
"
2 13 Stan "Oh-h. Nowhere. 
"
2 14 Stan "But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2 14 Stan "What, dude?
"
2 14 Stan "That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello there, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
"
2 14 Stan "You do?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
2 14 Stan "We've gotta help him, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
"
2 14 Stan "Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
"
2 14 Stan "Wow, you remember him?
"
2 14 Stan "So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
2 14 Stan "Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
"
2 14 Stan "'Kay.
"
2 14 Stan "Thanks, dude.
"
2 14 Stan "Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
"
2 14 Stan "Our friend, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! So you'll help him?
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
"
2 14 Stan "Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"
2 14 Stan "No, you don't!
"
2 14 Stan "You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
"
2 14 Stan "No more Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "We can't let him down, you guys.
"
2 14 Stan "Dude, it's over. He's gone.
"
2 14 Stan "No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
2 14 Stan "It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
"
2 14 Stan "Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
"
2 14 Stan "Elton John! What are you doing here?
"
2 14 Stan "Boy, do we!
"
2 14 Stan "Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
"
2 14 Stan "Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
"
2 14 Stan "We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
2 14 Stan "Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
"
2 15 Stan "I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, this is creepy.
"
2 15 Stan "Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 
"
2 15 Stan "Wow!
"
2 15 Stan "I don't know. 
"
2 15 Stan "I don't like it. It's spooky.
"
2 15 Stan "Do I have to?
"
2 15 Stan "Damn it! 
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
"
2 15 Stan "Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
"
2 15 Stan "Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!
"
2 15 Stan "Can you leave the light on, Dad?
"
2 15 Stan "I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
2 15 Stan "Where did it go?  Huhhh. 
"
2 15 Stan "Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
"
2 15 Stan "Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
"
2 15 Stan "No!
"
2 15 Stan "AAAAAAAAH! 
"
2 15 Stan "The fish!  But-.
"
2 15 Stan "WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
"
2 15 Stan "You're not gonna get away with this! 
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, what are you doing?
"
2 15 Stan "Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
"
2 15 Stan "But MOM!
"
2 15 Stan "MMOOMM!
"
2 15 Stan "No, mom!
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping so well.
"
2 15 Stan "Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
"
2 15 Stan "I haven't been sleeping well.
"
2 15 Stan "My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
"
2 15 Stan "What are you doing?!
"
2 15 Stan "Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
"
2 15 Stan "What?
"
2 15 Stan "Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
2 15 Stan "Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
"
2 15 Stan "Cartman!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
"
2 15 Stan "Do you remember what pet store?
"
2 15 Stan "Where?
"
2 15 Stan "That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
"
2 15 Stan "Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
"
2 15 Stan "It was the fish! 
"
2 15 Stan "Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
"
2 15 Stan "Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, we're running out of time. 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, my goldfish-.
"
2 15 Stan "I know.
"
2 15 Stan "Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
"
2 15 Stan "I wanna return a fish.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah, dude.
"
2 15 Stan "So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"
2 15 Stan "We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
"
2 15 Stan "Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
"
2 15 Stan "I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
2 15 Stan "Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah!
"
2 15 Stan "I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"
2 15 Stan "You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
"
2 15 Stan "Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
"
2 15 Stan "We won, dude!
"
2 15 Stan "Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
"
2 15 Stan "Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
"
2 15 Stan "Get to the stage! 
"
2 15 Stan "Up yours, evil twin! 
"
2 15 Stan "Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
"
2 15 Stan "Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
"
2 15 Stan "Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"
2 15 Stan "You tricked us, Cartman!
"
2 16 Stan "But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
"
2 16 Stan "But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
"
2 16 Stan "I don't want your lame-ass supper!
"
2 16 Stan "Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
"
2 16 Stan "Okay, let's go!
"
2 16 Stan "'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
"
2 16 Stan "So, how far is it to Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah. Or, we could not.
"
2 16 Stan "This is Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
"
2 16 Stan "He's the fat one.
"
2 16 Stan "Sick, dude.
"
2 16 Stan "Yeah, right!
"
2 16 Stan "My family's dead! 
"
2 16 Stan "They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, is he here every year like this?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
2 16 Stan "What, dude? 
"
2 16 Stan "Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
"
2 16 Stan "What was that?
"
2 16 Stan "I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
"
2 16 Stan "We thought you were in jail.
"
2 16 Stan "Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
"
2 16 Stan "All families suck ass!
"
2 16 Stan "Do you really think we should go with this guy?
"
2 16 Stan "Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
"
2 16 Stan "I really like that guy.
"
2 16 Stan "Mr. Hankey? 
"
2 16 Stan "You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, boy. You've done it now.
"
2 16 Stan "Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
"
2 16 Stan "Hey. Where's Kenny?
"
2 16 Stan "Oh, hey Kenny.
"
2 16 Stan "There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
"
2 16 Stan "Oh ooh.
"
2 16 Stan "...Sorry.
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
2 16 Stan "'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"
2 16 Stan "Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
2 16 Stan "I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
"
2 16 Stan "What?!
"
2 16 Stan "But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
"
2 16 Stan "I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 
"
2 16 Stan "I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
"
2 16 Stan "Really?
"
2 16 Stan "Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
"
2 16 Stan "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
2 17 Stan "That's okay with us.
"
2 17 Stan "Oh, not Tweek.
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, we can't work with this kid.
"
2 17 Stan "No.
"
2 17 Stan "Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
"
2 17 Stan "Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
"
2 17 Stan "Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"
2 17 Stan "What?
"
2 17 Stan "What gnomes?
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
"
2 17 Stan "'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah.
"
2 17 Stan "Kind of bitter.
"
2 17 Stan "Aooooo!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeess, this stuff rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Whoopee!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
"
2 17 Stan "Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
2 17 Stan "Bad!
"
2 17 Stan "No, we'll use it.
"
2 17 Stan "Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
"
2 17 Stan "Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
"
2 17 Stan "Huh??
"
2 17 Stan "Our case?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh... Hooray.
"
2 17 Stan "Uh...
"
2 17 Stan "I like small businesses.
"
2 17 Stan "Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
2 17 Stan "'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
"
2 17 Stan "Yeah, that makes sense.
"
2 17 Stan "How do we stretch that into five minutes?
"
2 17 Stan "What the hell? 
"
2 17 Stan "Hey there, little guy.
"
2 17 Stan "Hey, he talks!
"
2 17 Stan "Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
"
2 17 Stan "Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
"
2 17 Stan "Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
"
2 17 Stan "I don't get it.
"
2 17 Stan "No you don't, fatass!
"
2 17 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
2 17 Stan "Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
"
2 17 Stan "Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
"
2 17 Stan "Underpants?
"
2 17 Stan "Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
"
2 17 Stan "Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
"
2 18 Stan "Holy crap. dude!
"
2 18 Stan "This guy rules!
"
2 18 Stan "Yeah! 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude!
"
2 18 Stan "Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
"
2 18 Stan "Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
"
2 18 Stan "Can you climb back up, dude?
"
2 18 Stan "Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
2 18 Stan "Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
"
2 18 Stan "Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
"
2 18 Stan "All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
"
2 18 Stan "He's like, some frozen guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
2 18 Stan "You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
"
2 18 Stan "Help me chip some of the ice away.
"
2 18 Stan "Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
"
2 18 Stan "Where shall we bring it?
"
2 18 Stan "I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
"
2 18 Stan "You didn't find him, I found him.
"
2 18 Stan "You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh, excuse me?
"
2 18 Stan "I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Stan "Really.
"
2 18 Stan "Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "No, it isn't!
"
2 18 Stan "I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "No, I'll go! I found him!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Uh. Hi.
"
2 18 Stan "He said, ""hi.""
"
2 18 Stan "He wants to know where he is.
"
2 18 Stan "You're... home. 
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
2 18 Stan "Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
"
2 18 Stan "Fine! 
"
2 18 Stan "He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
2 18 Stan "I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
"
2 18 Stan "Let him out, dude. He's scared.
"
2 18 Stan "Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"
2 18 Stan "I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here?
"
2 18 Stan "What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "His name is Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
"
2 18 Stan "No he doesn't!!
"
2 18 Stan "I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Stan "You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
"
2 18 Stan "Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
"
2 18 Stan "I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
"
2 18 Stan "Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
"
2 18 Stan "You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
2 18 Stan "Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
"
2 18 Stan "Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Stan "Come on! 
"
2 18 Stan "We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
2 18 Stan "My friend, Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
"
2 18 Stan "Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
"
2 18 Stan "'K.
"
2 18 Stan "O-okay.
"
2 18 Stan "'K 
"
2 18 Stan "Ow!
"
2 18 Stan "Watch my coat, dude.
"
2 18 Stan "Huh? 
"
2 18 Stan "No problem, Gorak.
"
2 18 Stan "Yup.
"
2 18 Stan "Right on.
"
2 18 Stan "His... name... is... Gorak!
"
2 18 Stan "They're after you! 
"
2 18 Stan "Where's Gorak??
"
2 18 Stan "Wait, look! The helicopter! 
"
2 18 Stan "He's alive!
"
2 18 Stan "Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
"
2 18 Stan "Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"
