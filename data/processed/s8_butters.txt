"
8 1 Butters "I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
"
8 1 Butters "Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!

8 4 Butters "Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
"
8 4 Butters "Yeah well, you tell that to their families.

8 4 Butters "I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!

A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
"
8 5 Butters "Whoa...
"
8 5 Butters "You... you're my robot?
"
8 5 Butters "Oh wow!
"
8 5 Butters "Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
"
8 5 Butters "Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
"
8 5 Butters "Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
"
8 5 Butters "Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
"
8 5 Butters "Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
"
8 5 Butters "No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
"
8 5 Butters "When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
"
8 5 Butters "I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
"
8 5 Butters "Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
"
8 5 Butters "How come?
"
8 5 Butters "Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
"
8 5 Butters "Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
"
8 5 Butters "That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
"
8 5 Butters "Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
"
8 5 Butters "Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
"
8 5 Butters "Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
"
8 5 Butters "I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
"
8 5 Butters "Oh. Yeah.
"
8 5 Butters "Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
"
8 5 Butters "Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
"
8 5 Butters "Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
"
8 5 Butters "AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
"
8 5 Butters "Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
"
8 5 Butters "All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
"
8 5 Butters "Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
"
8 5 Butters "AWESOM-O?!
"
8 5 Butters "AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
"
8 5 Butters "Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
"
8 5 Butters "Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
"
8 5 Butters "Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
"
8 5 Butters "Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

8 5 Butters "Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?

8 5 Butters "Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.

8 5 Butters "There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.

8 5 Butters "What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  ""To Butters Stotch.""  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa.""  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
"
8 5 Butters "Whoa...
"
8 5 Butters "You... you're my robot?
"
8 5 Butters "Oh wow!
"
8 5 Butters "Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
"
8 5 Butters "Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
"
8 5 Butters "Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
"
8 5 Butters "Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
"
8 5 Butters "Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
"
8 5 Butters "No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
"
8 5 Butters "When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
"
8 5 Butters "I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"
8 5 Butters "Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
"
8 5 Butters "Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
"
8 5 Butters "How come?
"
8 5 Butters "Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
"
8 5 Butters "Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
"
8 5 Butters "That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
"
8 5 Butters "Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.

To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
"
8 5 Butters "Oh. Yeah.
"
8 5 Butters "Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
"
8 5 Butters "Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
"
8 5 Butters "Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
"
8 5 Butters "AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
"
8 5 Butters "Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
"
8 5 Butters "All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...

"
8 1 Butters "I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
"
8 1 Butters "Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!

"
8 1 Butters "Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
