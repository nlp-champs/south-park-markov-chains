12 1 Kyle "Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "...No. Way.
"
12 1 Kyle "...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
12 1 Kyle "I do. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
12 1 Kyle "Wagh.
"
12 1 Kyle "What? No?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What?
"
12 1 Kyle "No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
12 1 Kyle "Why do I have HIV?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What did you do?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
12 1 Kyle "AAAAAAA! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Here you go!  Here you go! 
"
12 1 Kyle "He gave me AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
12 1 Kyle "An apology?!
"
12 1 Kyle "...What?!
"
12 1 Kyle "A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
12 1 Kyle "There is no cure, you asshole!
"
12 1 Kyle "What hope?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You're lying!
"
12 1 Kyle "Magic Johnson?
"
12 1 Kyle "So what?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
12 1 Kyle "NO!
"
12 1 Kyle "Don't. Touch me.
"
12 1 Kyle "Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
"
12 1 Kyle "Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
"
12 1 Kyle "Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
12 1 Kyle "Yes!!
"
12 1 Kyle "Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
12 1 Kyle "But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
"
12 1 Kyle "Dude.
"
12 1 Kyle "You sleep with money. Every night?
"
12 1 Kyle "Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
"
12 1 Kyle "Wugh.
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand dollars?
"
12 2 Kyle "Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
12 2 Kyle "It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
12 2 Kyle "We uh, we have special permission?
"
12 2 Kyle "We did it guys!
"
12 2 Kyle "Ahall right!
"
12 2 Kyle "All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
12 2 Kyle "All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
12 2 Kyle "How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
12 2 Kyle "Whew.
"
12 2 Kyle "Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh crap! 
"
12 2 Kyle "What?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
12 2 Kyle "Aw come on now, people! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
12 2 Kyle "Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
"
12 2 Kyle "Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
12 2 Kyle "I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
12 2 Kyle "Huh? 
"
12 2 Kyle "What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
12 2 Kyle "NO!
"
12 2 Kyle "You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
12 2 Kyle "Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
12 2 Kyle "Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
12 2 Kyle "She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
12 2 Kyle "Corn harvest!
"
12 3 Kyle "You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
12 3 Kyle "You guys are wasting your time.
"
12 3 Kyle "Whoa! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
12 3 Kyle "Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
12 3 Kyle "Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
12 3 Kyle "Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
12 3 Kyle "We've gotta keep this away from him.
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah?
"
12 3 Kyle "No.
"
12 3 Kyle "All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
12 3 Kyle "I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
"
12 3 Kyle "God! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
12 3 Kyle "What?
"
12 3 Kyle "What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I have no idea.
"
12 3 Kyle "And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? Kenny?!
"
12 4 Kyle "Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
12 4 Kyle "You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
12 4 Kyle "There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
12 4 Kyle "Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
"
12 4 Kyle "We totally think you should have more money.
"
12 4 Kyle "Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
12 4 Kyle "The Internet?
"
12 4 Kyle "They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
12 4 Kyle "We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
12 4 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
12 4 Kyle "Excuse me.  Hello?
"
12 4 Kyle "Wait we're working on it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
12 4 Kyle "We don't want you to die.
"
12 4 Kyle "We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, we did it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
12 4 Kyle "Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
"
12 4 Kyle "Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
12 4 Kyle "He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
"
12 4 Kyle "If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
12 4 Kyle "Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
12 4 Kyle "Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Here you go. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not the teacher, fatass.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not an awesome teacher!
"
12 5 Kyle "The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
12 5 Kyle "Kenny's!
"
12 5 Kyle "Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
"
12 5 Kyle "What?
"
12 6 Kyle "Ih it's not working.
"
12 6 Kyle "I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
12 6 Kyle "I have to get online before school.
"
12 6 Kyle "It's not working here?
"
12 6 Kyle "Where... is... the Internet?
"
12 6 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
12 6 Kyle "I think... I know what's wrong.
"
12 7 Kyle "This is gonna suck.
"
12 7 Kyle "I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
"
12 7 Kyle "That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
12 7 Kyle "Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
12 7 Kyle "What's that?
"
12 7 Kyle "Come on, this is serious!
"
12 7 Kyle "Here! Here's the phone! 
"
12 7 Kyle "What's the number to dial out?
"
12 7 Kyle "I got through. Hello, police?
"
12 7 Kyle "There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
"
12 7 Kyle "The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
12 7 Kyle "Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
12 7 Kyle "Will you shut up!
"
12 7 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
12 7 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
12 8 Kyle "Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
12 8 Kyle "Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
12 8 Kyle "I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
12 8 Kyle "No... No!  No...
"
12 8 Kyle "No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
12 8 Kyle "We can't just leave!
"
12 8 Kyle "Aw it's horrible! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Somebody do something!
"
12 8 Kyle "They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
12 8 Kyle "WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
12 8 Kyle "NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
12 8 Kyle "My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
12 8 Kyle "I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
"
12 8 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I love you too.
"
12 8 Kyle "Did you see it?
"
12 8 Kyle "Indy deserved more than that!
"
12 8 Kyle "I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
"
12 8 Kyle "It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
12 8 Kyle "What?
"
12 8 Kyle "We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
12 9 Kyle "No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
12 10 Kyle "I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
12 10 Kyle "Girls like shaved balls?
"
12 10 Kyle "I think Kenny likes it. 
"
12 10 Kyle "Two hundred dollars?
"
12 10 Kyle "...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
12 10 Kyle "But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
12 10 Kyle "Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
12 10 Kyle "Gracias.
"
12 10 Kyle "This is awesome!
"
12 10 Kyle "God damn it!
"
12 10 Kyle "Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
12 10 Kyle "Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
"
12 10 Kyle "We just wanna go home.
"
12 10 Kyle "Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
12 10 Kyle "No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
12 10 Kyle "You know I can't go there, Stan!
"
12 10 Kyle "That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
12 10 Kyle "This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
12 10 Kyle "Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
12 11 Kyle "And that makes sense to you?
"
12 11 Kyle "So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
12 11 Kyle "That's right!
"
12 11 Kyle "Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
12 11 Kyle "Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
12 11 Kyle "I don't know. It's old.
"
12 11 Kyle "Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
12 11 Kyle "Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
12 11 Kyle "Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
12 11 Kyle "That is Craig. 
"
12 11 Kyle "Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
12 11 Kyle "How do you do that?
"
12 11 Kyle "Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah, what a dick!
"
12 12 Kyle "Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
12 12 Kyle "He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
12 12 Kyle "Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
12 12 Kyle "What?!
"
12 12 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
12 12 Kyle "Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
"
12 12 Kyle "Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
12 12 Kyle "Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
12 12 Kyle "No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
12 12 Kyle "We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
12 12 Kyle "We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
12 12 Kyle "E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
12 12 Kyle "What the hell?  Ike?
"
12 13 Kyle "What's High School Musical 3?
"
12 13 Kyle "Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
12 13 Kyle "They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
12 13 Kyle "I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
"
12 13 Kyle "I swear
"
12 13 Kyle "What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
12 13 Kyle "Aw man.
"
12 13 Kyle "You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
12 13 Kyle "What? Are you crazy?
"
12 13 Kyle "We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
12 13 Kyle "Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
12 13 Kyle "Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
12 13 Kyle "We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"
12 13 Kyle "You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"
12 13 Kyle "Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
12 13 Kyle "Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
12 13 Kyle "Where did everybody go?
"
12 14 Kyle "Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
12 14 Kyle "Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
12 1 Kyle "Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "...No. Way.
"
12 1 Kyle "...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
12 1 Kyle "I do. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
12 1 Kyle "Wagh.
"
12 1 Kyle "What? No?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What?
"
12 1 Kyle "No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
12 1 Kyle "Why do I have HIV?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What did you do?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
12 1 Kyle "AAAAAAA! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Here you go!  Here you go! 
"
12 1 Kyle "He gave me AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
12 1 Kyle "An apology?!
"
12 1 Kyle "...What?!
"
12 1 Kyle "A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
12 1 Kyle "There is no cure, you asshole!
"
12 1 Kyle "What hope?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You're lying!
"
12 1 Kyle "Magic Johnson?
"
12 1 Kyle "So what?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
12 1 Kyle "NO!
"
12 1 Kyle "Don't. Touch me.
"
12 1 Kyle "Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
"
12 1 Kyle "Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
"
12 1 Kyle "Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
12 1 Kyle "Yes!!
"
12 1 Kyle "Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
12 1 Kyle "But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
"
12 1 Kyle "Dude.
"
12 1 Kyle "You sleep with money. Every night?
"
12 1 Kyle "Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
"
12 1 Kyle "Wugh.
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand dollars?
"
12 2 Kyle "Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
12 2 Kyle "It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
12 2 Kyle "We uh, we have special permission?
"
12 2 Kyle "We did it guys!
"
12 2 Kyle "Ahall right!
"
12 2 Kyle "All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
12 2 Kyle "All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
12 2 Kyle "How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
12 2 Kyle "Whew.
"
12 2 Kyle "Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh crap! 
"
12 2 Kyle "What?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
12 2 Kyle "Aw come on now, people! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
12 2 Kyle "Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
"
12 2 Kyle "Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
12 2 Kyle "I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
12 2 Kyle "Huh? 
"
12 2 Kyle "What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
12 2 Kyle "NO!
"
12 2 Kyle "You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
12 2 Kyle "Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
12 2 Kyle "Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
12 2 Kyle "She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
12 2 Kyle "Corn harvest!
"
12 3 Kyle "You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
12 3 Kyle "You guys are wasting your time.
"
12 3 Kyle "Whoa! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
12 3 Kyle "Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
12 3 Kyle "Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
12 3 Kyle "Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
12 3 Kyle "We've gotta keep this away from him.
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah?
"
12 3 Kyle "No.
"
12 3 Kyle "All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
12 3 Kyle "I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
"
12 3 Kyle "God! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
12 3 Kyle "What?
"
12 3 Kyle "What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I have no idea.
"
12 3 Kyle "And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? Kenny?!
"
12 4 Kyle "Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
12 4 Kyle "You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
12 4 Kyle "There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
12 4 Kyle "Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
"
12 4 Kyle "We totally think you should have more money.
"
12 4 Kyle "Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
12 4 Kyle "The Internet?
"
12 4 Kyle "They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
12 4 Kyle "We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
12 4 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
12 4 Kyle "Excuse me.  Hello?
"
12 4 Kyle "Wait we're working on it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
12 4 Kyle "We don't want you to die.
"
12 4 Kyle "We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, we did it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
12 4 Kyle "Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
"
12 4 Kyle "Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
12 4 Kyle "He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
"
12 4 Kyle "If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
12 4 Kyle "Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
12 4 Kyle "Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Here you go. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not the teacher, fatass.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not an awesome teacher!
"
12 5 Kyle "The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
12 5 Kyle "Kenny's!
"
12 5 Kyle "Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
"
12 5 Kyle "What?
"
12 6 Kyle "Ih it's not working.
"
12 6 Kyle "I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
12 6 Kyle "I have to get online before school.
"
12 6 Kyle "It's not working here?
"
12 6 Kyle "Where... is... the Internet?
"
12 6 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
12 6 Kyle "I think... I know what's wrong.
"
12 7 Kyle "This is gonna suck.
"
12 7 Kyle "I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
"
12 7 Kyle "That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
12 7 Kyle "Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
12 7 Kyle "What's that?
"
12 7 Kyle "Come on, this is serious!
"
12 7 Kyle "Here! Here's the phone! 
"
12 7 Kyle "What's the number to dial out?
"
12 7 Kyle "I got through. Hello, police?
"
12 7 Kyle "There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
"
12 7 Kyle "The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
12 7 Kyle "Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
12 7 Kyle "Will you shut up!
"
12 7 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
12 7 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
12 8 Kyle "Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
12 8 Kyle "Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
12 8 Kyle "I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
12 8 Kyle "No... No!  No...
"
12 8 Kyle "No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
12 8 Kyle "We can't just leave!
"
12 8 Kyle "Aw it's horrible! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Somebody do something!
"
12 8 Kyle "They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
12 8 Kyle "WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
12 8 Kyle "NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
12 8 Kyle "My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
12 8 Kyle "I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
"
12 8 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I love you too.
"
12 8 Kyle "Did you see it?
"
12 8 Kyle "Indy deserved more than that!
"
12 8 Kyle "I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
"
12 8 Kyle "It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
12 8 Kyle "What?
"
12 8 Kyle "We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
12 9 Kyle "No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
12 10 Kyle "I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
12 10 Kyle "Girls like shaved balls?
"
12 10 Kyle "I think Kenny likes it. 
"
12 10 Kyle "Two hundred dollars?
"
12 10 Kyle "...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
12 10 Kyle "But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
12 10 Kyle "Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
12 10 Kyle "Gracias.
"
12 10 Kyle "This is awesome!
"
12 10 Kyle "God damn it!
"
12 10 Kyle "Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
12 10 Kyle "Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
"
12 10 Kyle "We just wanna go home.
"
12 10 Kyle "Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
12 10 Kyle "No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
12 10 Kyle "You know I can't go there, Stan!
"
12 10 Kyle "That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
12 10 Kyle "This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
12 10 Kyle "Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
12 11 Kyle "And that makes sense to you?
"
12 11 Kyle "So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
12 11 Kyle "That's right!
"
12 11 Kyle "Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
12 11 Kyle "Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
12 11 Kyle "I don't know. It's old.
"
12 11 Kyle "Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
12 11 Kyle "Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
12 11 Kyle "Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
12 11 Kyle "That is Craig. 
"
12 11 Kyle "Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
12 11 Kyle "How do you do that?
"
12 11 Kyle "Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah, what a dick!
"
12 12 Kyle "Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
12 12 Kyle "He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
12 12 Kyle "Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
12 12 Kyle "What?!
"
12 12 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
12 12 Kyle "Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
"
12 12 Kyle "Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
12 12 Kyle "Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
12 12 Kyle "No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
12 12 Kyle "We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
12 12 Kyle "We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
12 12 Kyle "E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
12 12 Kyle "What the hell?  Ike?
"
12 13 Kyle "What's High School Musical 3?
"
12 13 Kyle "Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
12 13 Kyle "They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
12 13 Kyle "I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
"
12 13 Kyle "I swear
"
12 13 Kyle "What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
12 13 Kyle "Aw man.
"
12 13 Kyle "You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
12 13 Kyle "What? Are you crazy?
"
12 13 Kyle "We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
12 13 Kyle "Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
12 13 Kyle "Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
12 13 Kyle "We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"
12 13 Kyle "You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"
12 13 Kyle "Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
12 13 Kyle "Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
12 13 Kyle "Where did everybody go?
"
12 14 Kyle "Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
12 14 Kyle "Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
12 1 Kyle "Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
"
12 1 Kyle "...No. Way.
"
12 1 Kyle "...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
12 1 Kyle "I do. 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
12 1 Kyle "Wagh.
"
12 1 Kyle "What? No?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What?
"
12 1 Kyle "No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
12 1 Kyle "Why do I have HIV?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What did you do?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
12 1 Kyle "AAAAAAA! 
"
12 1 Kyle "Here you go!  Here you go! 
"
12 1 Kyle "He gave me AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
12 1 Kyle "An apology?!
"
12 1 Kyle "...What?!
"
12 1 Kyle "A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
12 1 Kyle "There is no cure, you asshole!
"
12 1 Kyle "What hope?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You're lying!
"
12 1 Kyle "Magic Johnson?
"
12 1 Kyle "So what?!
"
12 1 Kyle "You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
12 1 Kyle "NO!
"
12 1 Kyle "Don't. Touch me.
"
12 1 Kyle "Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
"
12 1 Kyle "Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
12 1 Kyle "What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"
12 1 Kyle "Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
"
12 1 Kyle "Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
12 1 Kyle "Yes!!
"
12 1 Kyle "Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
12 1 Kyle "But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
"
12 1 Kyle "Dude.
"
12 1 Kyle "You sleep with money. Every night?
"
12 1 Kyle "Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
"
12 1 Kyle "Wugh.
"
12 1 Kyle "Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
"
12 1 Kyle "I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand dollars?
"
12 2 Kyle "Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
12 2 Kyle "It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
12 2 Kyle "A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
12 2 Kyle "We uh, we have special permission?
"
12 2 Kyle "We did it guys!
"
12 2 Kyle "Ahall right!
"
12 2 Kyle "All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
12 2 Kyle "All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
12 2 Kyle "How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
12 2 Kyle "Whew.
"
12 2 Kyle "Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Oh crap! 
"
12 2 Kyle "What?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
12 2 Kyle "Aw come on now, people! 
"
12 2 Kyle "Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
12 2 Kyle "Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
"
12 2 Kyle "Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
12 2 Kyle "I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
12 2 Kyle "Huh? 
"
12 2 Kyle "What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
12 2 Kyle "NO!
"
12 2 Kyle "You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
12 2 Kyle "Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"
12 2 Kyle "Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
12 2 Kyle "Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
12 2 Kyle "She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
12 2 Kyle "Corn harvest!
"
12 3 Kyle "You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
12 3 Kyle "You guys are wasting your time.
"
12 3 Kyle "Whoa! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
12 3 Kyle "Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
12 3 Kyle "Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny!
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
12 3 Kyle "Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
12 3 Kyle "We've gotta keep this away from him.
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah?
"
12 3 Kyle "No.
"
12 3 Kyle "All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
12 3 Kyle "I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
"
12 3 Kyle "God! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
12 3 Kyle "What?
"
12 3 Kyle "What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
12 3 Kyle "Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
12 3 Kyle "I have no idea.
"
12 3 Kyle "And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
12 3 Kyle "Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny! 
"
12 3 Kyle "Kenny? Kenny?!
"
12 4 Kyle "Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
12 4 Kyle "You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
12 4 Kyle "There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
12 4 Kyle "Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
"
12 4 Kyle "We totally think you should have more money.
"
12 4 Kyle "Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
12 4 Kyle "The Internet?
"
12 4 Kyle "They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
12 4 Kyle "We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
12 4 Kyle "Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
12 4 Kyle "Excuse me.  Hello?
"
12 4 Kyle "Wait we're working on it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
12 4 Kyle "We don't want you to die.
"
12 4 Kyle "We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
"
12 4 Kyle "Okay, we did it.
"
12 4 Kyle "Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
12 4 Kyle "Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
"
12 4 Kyle "Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
12 4 Kyle "He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
"
12 4 Kyle "If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
12 4 Kyle "Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
12 4 Kyle "Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah. Here you go. 
"
12 4 Kyle "Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not the teacher, fatass.
"
12 5 Kyle "You're not an awesome teacher!
"
12 5 Kyle "The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
12 5 Kyle "Kenny's!
"
12 5 Kyle "Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
"
12 5 Kyle "What?
"
12 6 Kyle "Ih it's not working.
"
12 6 Kyle "I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
12 6 Kyle "I have to get online before school.
"
12 6 Kyle "It's not working here?
"
12 6 Kyle "Where... is... the Internet?
"
12 6 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
12 6 Kyle "I think... I know what's wrong.
"
12 7 Kyle "This is gonna suck.
"
12 7 Kyle "I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
"
12 7 Kyle "That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
12 7 Kyle "Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
12 7 Kyle "What's that?
"
12 7 Kyle "Come on, this is serious!
"
12 7 Kyle "Here! Here's the phone! 
"
12 7 Kyle "What's the number to dial out?
"
12 7 Kyle "I got through. Hello, police?
"
12 7 Kyle "There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
"
12 7 Kyle "The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
12 7 Kyle "Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
12 7 Kyle "Will you shut up!
"
12 7 Kyle "I don't believe it.
"
12 7 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
12 7 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
12 8 Kyle "Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
12 8 Kyle "Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
12 8 Kyle "I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
12 8 Kyle "I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
12 8 Kyle "No... No!  No...
"
12 8 Kyle "No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
12 8 Kyle "We can't just leave!
"
12 8 Kyle "Aw it's horrible! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Somebody do something!
"
12 8 Kyle "They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
12 8 Kyle "Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
12 8 Kyle "WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
12 8 Kyle "NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
12 8 Kyle "My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
12 8 Kyle "I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
"
12 8 Kyle "Stan?
"
12 8 Kyle "I love you too.
"
12 8 Kyle "Did you see it?
"
12 8 Kyle "Indy deserved more than that!
"
12 8 Kyle "I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
"
12 8 Kyle "It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
12 8 Kyle "What?
"
12 8 Kyle "We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
12 9 Kyle "No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
12 10 Kyle "I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
12 10 Kyle "Girls like shaved balls?
"
12 10 Kyle "I think Kenny likes it. 
"
12 10 Kyle "Two hundred dollars?
"
12 10 Kyle "...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
12 10 Kyle "But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
12 10 Kyle "Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
12 10 Kyle "Gracias.
"
12 10 Kyle "This is awesome!
"
12 10 Kyle "God damn it!
"
12 10 Kyle "Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
12 10 Kyle "Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
"
12 10 Kyle "We just wanna go home.
"
12 10 Kyle "Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
12 10 Kyle "No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
12 10 Kyle "You know I can't go there, Stan!
"
12 10 Kyle "That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
12 10 Kyle "This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
12 10 Kyle "Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
12 11 Kyle "And that makes sense to you?
"
12 11 Kyle "So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
12 11 Kyle "That's right!
"
12 11 Kyle "Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
12 11 Kyle "Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
12 11 Kyle "I don't know. It's old.
"
12 11 Kyle "Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
12 11 Kyle "Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
12 11 Kyle "Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
12 11 Kyle "That is Craig. 
"
12 11 Kyle "Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
12 11 Kyle "How do you do that?
"
12 11 Kyle "Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
12 11 Kyle "Yeah, what a dick!
"
12 12 Kyle "Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
12 12 Kyle "He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
12 12 Kyle "Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
12 12 Kyle "What?!
"
12 12 Kyle "Oh my God! 
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
12 12 Kyle "Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
"
12 12 Kyle "Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
12 12 Kyle "Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
12 12 Kyle "No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
12 12 Kyle "We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
12 12 Kyle "We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
12 12 Kyle "E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
12 12 Kyle "Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
12 12 Kyle "What the hell?  Ike?
"
12 13 Kyle "What's High School Musical 3?
"
12 13 Kyle "Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
12 13 Kyle "They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
12 13 Kyle "I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
"
12 13 Kyle "I swear
"
12 13 Kyle "What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
12 13 Kyle "Aw man.
"
12 13 Kyle "You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
12 13 Kyle "What? Are you crazy?
"
12 13 Kyle "We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
12 13 Kyle "Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
12 13 Kyle "Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
12 13 Kyle "We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"
12 13 Kyle "You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"
12 13 Kyle "Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
12 13 Kyle "Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
12 13 Kyle "Where did everybody go?
"
12 14 Kyle "Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
12 14 Kyle "Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
