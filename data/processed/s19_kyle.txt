19 1 Kyle "Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter And I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
"
19 1 Kyle "Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?
"
19 1 Kyle "Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!
"
19 1 Kyle "You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator?
"
19 1 Kyle "Cool. I think we did it. 
"
19 1 Kyle "Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!

19 1 Kyle "Why?
"
19 1 Kyle "No, you're a bigot.

19 1 Kyle "I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person!

19 1 Kyle "Oh fuck you.

19 1 Kyle "Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
"
19 1 Kyle "Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. 
"
19 1 Kyle "I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!
"
19 1 Kyle "HER, yes!
"
19 1 Kyle "Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP!  This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning.

"
19 2 Kyle "Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
"
19 2 Kyle "You guys, immigration either legal or illegal are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-

19 2 Kyle "Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with-
"
19 2 Kyle "Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of...  this... kind of...

19 5 Kyle "There's more than two people on the Internet.

19 2 Kyle "I'm sitting right here.
"
19 2 Kyle "You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
"
19 2 Kyle "What??
"
19 2 Kyle "I didn't even wanna give that speech!
"
19 2 Kyle "Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
"
19 2 Kyle "You guys, immigration either legal or illegal are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
"
19 2 Kyle "Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with-
"
19 2 Kyle "Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of...  this... kind of... 
"
19 3 Kyle "I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
"
19 3 Kyle "Shhhh.
"
19 4 Kyle "So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-.
"
19 4 Kyle "Davíd is new to our school.
"
19 4 Kyle "Shut up.
"
19 4 Kyle "It's not supposed to have water you-!
"
19 4 Kyle "Are you joking?!
"
19 4 Kyle "He's not important. At. All.
"
19 4 Kyle "Ah,  don't, dude, dude- Don't.
"
19 4 Kyle "You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
"
19 4 Kyle "HA! 
"
19 4 Kyle "We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
"
19 4 Kyle "Nobody went for the fucking food!
"
19 4 Kyle "You're done! 
"
19 4 Kyle "Davíd! Dude, wait!  Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of.
"
19 4 Kyle "But this isn't Mexico.
"
19 4 Kyle "Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fatass!
"
19 4 Kyle "Every person here thinks this is about them.
"
19 4 Kyle "Yeah. Me too.
"
19 4 Kyle "Okay, bring in the next one.
"
19 5 Kyle "Uh huh.
"
19 5 Kyle "Yeah probably.
"
19 5 Kyle "Wait, what?
"
19 5 Kyle "You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp accounts and only give him the good comments?
"
19 5 Kyle "No.
"
19 5 Kyle "If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. 
"
19 5 Kyle "Give me... give me detention.
"
19 5 Kyle "Yeah, I'll take the detention.
"
19 5 Kyle "There's more than two people on the Internet.
"
19 5 Kyle "Butters, what are you doing?! 
"
19 5 Kyle "Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!
"
19 5 Kyle "Butters, listen to my voice.
"
19 5 Kyle "Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
"
19 6 Kyle "No. We would know.
"
19 6 Kyle "Yeah?
"
19 6 Kyle "What?
"
19 6 Kyle "No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship.
"
19 6 Kyle "I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all.
"
19 7 Kyle "What?
"
19 7 Kyle "You're lying.
"
19 7 Kyle "How is that gay?
"
19 7 Kyle "You're talking to Kyle right now.
"
19 7 Kyle "You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
"
19 7 Kyle "I'm right here. 
"
19 7 Kyle "Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!
"
19 7 Kyle "Oh shit!
"
19 8 Kyle "Oh Jesus, now what?
"
19 8 Kyle "Was what me, sir?
"
19 9 Kyle "What?
"
19 9 Kyle "Knock it off!
"
19 9 Kyle "Go get my pen, fatass
"
19 9 Kyle "Go get my pen!
"
19 9 Kyle "Goddammit! 
"
19 9 Kyle "Where's PC Principal?
"
19 9 Kyle "What are you talking about?
"
19 9 Kyle """Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-"" what the hell is this?
"
19 9 Kyle "Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
"
19 9 Kyle "I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
"
19 9 Kyle "Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
"
19 9 Kyle "There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
"
19 9 Kyle "Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet.
"
19 9 Kyle "I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal.  Where did you say PC Principal was from?
"
19 9 Kyle "Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about-  Goddammit what the hell is this?
"
19 9 Kyle "Dude. Dude, look at this. ""How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-""  Dude there it is again!
"
19 9 Kyle "It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
"
19 9 Kyle "I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
"
19 9 Kyle "It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself.
"
19 9 Kyle "It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan:	Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can-  Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
"
19 9 Kyle "OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. 
"
19 9 Kyle "So then what'd Token say?
"
19 9 Kyle "Whoa, what the hell just happened?
"
19 9 Kyle "We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
"
19 9 Kyle "It's like... someone's trying to... distract us.  Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
"
19 9 Kyle "Why are you looking at me?
"
19 9 Kyle "Well what are you guys talking about?
"
19 9 Kyle "What?!
"
19 9 Kyle "And why do you think that, Stan?!
"
19 9 Kyle "Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!
"
19 9 Kyle "It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!
"
19 9 Kyle "N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!
"
19 9 Kyle "Leslie.
"
19 9 Kyle "How do you know thi-?
"
19 9 Kyle "2692 
"
19 10 Kyle "Butters.  Get to the bathroom. Now. 
"
19 10 Kyle "Jimmy's dead.
"
19 10 Kyle "I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away.
"
19 10 Kyle "PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
"
19 10 Kyle "Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
"
19 10 Kyle "It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
"
19 10 Kyle "I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
"
19 10 Kyle "Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in.
"
19 10 Kyle "There's no way to know who we can trust.
"
19 10 Kyle "There's only one thing we can do.  We have to get guns.
"
19 10 Kyle "It's the only way for us to be safe.
"
19 10 Kyle "You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
"
19 10 Kyle "Are you okay?
"
19 10 Kyle "Here. 
"
19 10 Kyle "Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you. 
"
19 10 Kyle "Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe.
"
19 10 Kyle "I...  gave up giving speeches.
"
19 10 Kyle "I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side.
"
19 10 Kyle "Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence.
"
19 10 Kyle "The gun show.
"
19 10 Kyle "There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.
"
19 10 Kyle "Don't listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn't think like they do!  You sun of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?!
"
19 10 Kyle "Jimmy?
"
19 10 Kyle "You told me Jimmy was dead.
