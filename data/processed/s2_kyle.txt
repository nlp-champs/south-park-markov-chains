2 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 2 Kyle "He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
"
2 2 Kyle "What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
2 2 Kyle "Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
"
2 2 Kyle "Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "Really?
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing away
"
2 2 Kyle "Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 2 Kyle "Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
"
2 2 Kyle "Stan!
"
2 2 Kyle "Hey, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing ay...
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
"
2 2 Kyle "Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
"
2 2 Kyle "D'you have any wire here?
"
2 2 Kyle "No, he'll die!
"
2 2 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 2 Kyle "He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know. Let's find out.
"
2 3 Kyle "Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow, these books look cool!
"
2 3 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
"
2 3 Kyle "It looks like a note.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude, what's going on?
"
2 3 Kyle "How about a brain transplant? 
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"
2 3 Kyle "Oh no! 
"
2 3 Kyle "What's it say?
"
2 3 Kyle "Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""
"
2 3 Kyle "Here! Here, I found one!
"
2 3 Kyle "It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
2 3 Kyle "How's it goin', dude?
"
2 3 Kyle "Just read the sentence.
"
2 3 Kyle "Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
2 3 Kyle "He's here!
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
2 3 Kyle "So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
"
2 3 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 3 Kyle "Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 3 Kyle "I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
"
2 3 Kyle "It's poetic justice.
"
2 4 Kyle "We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, it's his bris.
"
2 4 Kyle "I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
2 4 Kyle "Uhhh... I'm not sure.
"
2 4 Kyle "Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
"
2 4 Kyle "How's it going?
"
2 4 Kyle "Why bad?
"
2 4 Kyle "Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
2 4 Kyle "No.
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, not ham, you fat fuck!
"
2 4 Kyle "Your heart?
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Stop who?
"
2 4 Kyle "What?
"
2 4 Kyle "Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
"
2 4 Kyle "That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
"
2 4 Kyle "I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom! Dad!
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
"
2 4 Kyle "Meaning what?
"
2 4 Kyle "AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
2 4 Kyle "I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
2 4 Kyle "I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
"
2 4 Kyle "Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
"
2 4 Kyle "You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
"
2 4 Kyle "I need one ticket for my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 4 Kyle "But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"
2 4 Kyle "They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
"
2 4 Kyle "Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
2 4 Kyle "Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
"
2 4 Kyle "There, what do you think?
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
2 4 Kyle "Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"
2 4 Kyle "Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
"
2 4 Kyle "Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
"
2 4 Kyle "No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Put him down, you stupid dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
"
2 4 Kyle "What??
"
2 4 Kyle "You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
"
2 4 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Aw, how the hell should I know?
"
2 4 Kyle "All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah, right.
"
2 4 Kyle "He's not my brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm sorry, Ike. 
"
2 4 Kyle "What do you want?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
"
2 4 Kyle "No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
"
2 4 Kyle "Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
"
2 4 Kyle "You stay away from my little brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
"
2 4 Kyle "And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"
2 4 Kyle "No!  No, it isn't true!
"
2 4 Kyle "It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
"
2 4 Kyle "Ike, you're okay. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
"
2 4 Kyle "And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
"
2 4 Kyle "M'kay?
"
2 5 Kyle "We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"
2 5 Kyle "No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
"
2 5 Kyle "I caught it! I caught it!
"
2 5 Kyle "Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
"
2 5 Kyle "Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
"
2 5 Kyle "Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No, it'll be okay!
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh-- Noooo!
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "I know.
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh!  Phew.
"
2 5 Kyle "Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
"
2 5 Kyle "AAGGGGGHHHH!!
"
2 5 Kyle "OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
"
2 5 Kyle "AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
"
2 5 Kyle "...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No-it looked dead.
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
"
2 5 Kyle "And then she walked over to--
"
2 5 Kyle "Uhhhh... Yeah. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
"
2 5 Kyle "Go for it, Pip. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
"
2 5 Kyle "Get him, Frenchy!
"
2 5 Kyle "Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
"
2 5 Kyle "Wow, that was easy.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
"
2 5 Kyle "Know what?
"
2 5 Kyle "But we could get killed!
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, what does that mean?
"
2 5 Kyle "Yeah, you're from China.
"
2 5 Kyle "But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
"
2 5 Kyle "You... bastards...
"
2 5 Kyle "What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
"
2 5 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 5 Kyle "Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
2 6 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
2 6 Kyle "Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
"
2 6 Kyle "Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"
2 6 Kyle "Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
2 6 Kyle "F-minus? Can he do that?
"
2 6 Kyle "How do you know? You weren't even there.
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
"
2 6 Kyle "We've got to get him back, dude.
"
2 6 Kyle "Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
"
2 6 Kyle "Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
"
2 6 Kyle "Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Der, Cartman!
"
2 6 Kyle "Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
2 6 Kyle "'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
2 6 Kyle "Look! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
"
2 6 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 6 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
2 6 Kyle "Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"
2 7 Kyle "Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
"
2 7 Kyle "I know, but, it's really snowy today.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
"
2 7 Kyle "I'm scared!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
"
2 7 Kyle "'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
"
2 7 Kyle "I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
"
2 7 Kyle "We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
2 7 Kyle "What?
"
2 7 Kyle "Worse than this?
"
2 7 Kyle "How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
2 7 Kyle "Fart, damn you!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, look at that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
"
2 7 Kyle "You can say that again.
"
2 7 Kyle "Nope.
"
2 7 Kyle "Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude! 
"
2 7 Kyle "On Wednesday or Thursday?
"
2 7 Kyle "Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He's making ice cream. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
"
2 7 Kyle "What was what?
"
2 7 Kyle "What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey yeah, I remember that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
2 7 Kyle "You... bastard? 
"
2 7 Kyle "Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 7 Kyle "We've just gotta stick together.
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
"
2 7 Kyle "What are we gonna do?
"
2 7 Kyle "There.  I think we got it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh no!
"
2 7 Kyle "Hello?
"
2 7 Kyle "Really?
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
"
2 8 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
"
2 8 Kyle "Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
"
2 8 Kyle "We wanna buy M-80s.
"
2 8 Kyle "What a baby.
"
2 8 Kyle "What do ya mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
"
2 8 Kyle "Oo bastards! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
2 8 Kyle "Let's go, dude. We're ready.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
"
2 8 Kyle "Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dusty the dirtball
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yup. 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
"
2 8 Kyle "Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
"
2 8 Kyle "I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! That thing is huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Kenny! Watch out! 
"
2 8 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 8 Kyle "What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
"
2 8 Kyle "What'd he say?
"
2 8 Kyle "How is that gonna help?
"
2 8 Kyle "A lot, I think.
"
2 8 Kyle "I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
"
2 8 Kyle "We're bored.
"
2 8 Kyle "Wow! These are huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look! It's snowing! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
"
2 9 Kyle "They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
"
2 9 Kyle "Sick, Kenny.
"
2 9 Kyle "All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
"
2 9 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 9 Kyle "If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"
2 9 Kyle "I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
"
2 9 Kyle "I'm poopies, ma!
"
2 9 Kyle "Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
"
2 9 Kyle "Could it be?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
"
2 9 Kyle "It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, I'm sure it was him.
"
2 9 Kyle "So how was that movie last night, dude?
"
2 9 Kyle "Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Well?
"
2 9 Kyle "There it is again! 
"
2 9 Kyle "It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Where does that grill go?
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
"
2 9 Kyle "We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
"
2 9 Kyle "What the hell? 
"
2 9 Kyle "In a sewer?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "I told you guys he'd be here!
"
2 9 Kyle "What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
"
2 9 Kyle "And that's why you got a cold?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
"
2 9 Kyle "Aaahh!
"
2 9 Kyle "Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
"
2 9 Kyle "He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Huh??
"
2 9 Kyle "Dude, no one even listened to me.
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
2 9 Kyle "We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
"
2 9 Kyle "It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
2 9 Kyle "Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
"
2 9 Kyle "You guys, we have to hurry!
"
2 9 Kyle "Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
"
2 9 Kyle "I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
"
2 9 Kyle "I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
"
2 9 Kyle "You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooohohohohohoho-
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yes?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo!
"
2 9 Kyle "Noo! No!
"
2 9 Kyle "Uuf.
"
2 9 Kyle "I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"
2 9 Kyle "Chef, does poo go to heaven?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "He's back! He's back! 
"
2 9 Kyle "You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
"
2 9 Kyle "No! 
"
2 9 Kyle "O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
"
2 9 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 9 Kyle "You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you guys having a meeting or something?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
"
2 10 Kyle "I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
2 10 Kyle "Heheheh, buns.
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
"
2 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell is that?
"
2 10 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. I feel great!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yes. Why?
"
2 10 Kyle "No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
"
2 10 Kyle "Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
"
2 10 Kyle "Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
2 10 Kyle "Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
"
2 10 Kyle "But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
"
2 10 Kyle "Gods and clods?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
"
2 10 Kyle "Could we go home now, Ma?
"
2 10 Kyle "But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"
2 10 Kyle "What's ""ookie mouth""?
"
2 10 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 10 Kyle "Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
"
2 10 Kyle "Argh!
"
2 10 Kyle "I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
"
2 10 Kyle "What the hell does that have to do with American history?
"
2 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
"
2 10 Kyle """So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""
"
2 10 Kyle "What?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
"
2 10 Kyle "You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Stan! Stan!
"
2 10 Kyle "Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
"
2 10 Kyle "Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
"
2 10 Kyle "Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
2 10 Kyle "No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
"
2 10 Kyle "Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
"
2 10 Kyle "Do you know anybody with herpes?
"
2 10 Kyle "Cool! Thanks, Chef!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you old Frida?
"
2 10 Kyle "Someone who wants a favor.
"
2 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 10 Kyle "Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
"
2 10 Kyle "D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
2 10 Kyle "Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
"
2 10 Kyle "Ugh... 
"
2 10 Kyle "We're sorry.
"
2 10 Kyle "This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
"
2 10 Kyle "I'm better now. 
"
2 10 Kyle "We gave you guys herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
"
2 11 Kyle "To where?
"
2 11 Kyle "Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
"
2 11 Kyle "You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
"
2 11 Kyle "I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""
"
2 11 Kyle "Hey, who are you?
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoopie.
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
"
2 11 Kyle "Me too. It was sweet.
"
2 11 Kyle "Did what?
"
2 11 Kyle "My head still feels funny.
"
2 11 Kyle "Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
2 11 Kyle "Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
"
2 11 Kyle "I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"
2 11 Kyle "Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
"
2 11 Kyle "I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
"
2 11 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 11 Kyle "Sshh!
"
2 11 Kyle "Why?
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, yeah.
"
2 11 Kyle "Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "What does that do?
"
2 11 Kyle "Kenny! What's it doing? 
"
2 11 Kyle "We're bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
"
2 11 Kyle "But it's true, dude!
"
2 11 Kyle "Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
"
2 11 Kyle "He's not highly intelligent.
"
2 11 Kyle "Cartman! You saved us! 
"
2 11 Kyle "He got a full dose of the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah! You're dead!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
"
2 12 Kyle "Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
2 12 Kyle "I dunno.
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "We do?
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
"
2 12 Kyle "What? Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
"
2 12 Kyle "It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
2 12 Kyle "Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "Good guess, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
"
2 12 Kyle "To me??
"
2 12 Kyle "We should use nails, dude.
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
"
2 12 Kyle "Right. Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Too eager to what?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah?
"
2 12 Kyle "Umm. Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
"
2 12 Kyle "It's just wrong, that's all.
"
2 12 Kyle "What the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
2 12 Kyle "Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay, that's fine.
"
2 12 Kyle "But I don't care.
"
2 12 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 13 Kyle "Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
2 13 Kyle "You suck, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "But ih-
"
2 13 Kyle "Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Mom, give me some money!
"
2 13 Kyle "I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "I will if you give me money!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
"
2 13 Kyle "Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"
2 13 Kyle "No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "You'd better be right, dude.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 13 Kyle "That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"
2 13 Kyle "That was a waste of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
"
2 13 Kyle "This ride better be good!
"
2 13 Kyle "We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
"
2 13 Kyle "Finally!
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 13 Kyle "Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 13 Kyle "How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
"
2 13 Kyle "What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
"
2 13 Kyle "That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
"
2 13 Kyle "I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
"
2 13 Kyle "This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "It worked!
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
"
2 13 Kyle "What?!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
"
2 13 Kyle "Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
"
2 13 Kyle "All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
"
2 13 Kyle "You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
"
2 13 Kyle "What'd you say, Cartman??
"
2 13 Kyle "I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay, Cartman. You ready?
"
2 13 Kyle "Open the gate! 
"
2 13 Kyle "That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
"
2 13 Kyle "Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
"
2 13 Kyle "That's better.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
"
2 13 Kyle "No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, I think we broke him.
"
2 13 Kyle "..Oh.
"
2 13 Kyle "We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 13 Kyle "You think?
"
2 13 Kyle "He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, I think so.
"
2 13 Kyle "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
"
2 13 Kyle "Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
"
2 13 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 13 Kyle "Hang on, Cartman! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Go help him, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 13 Kyle "How many ball does that get us?
"
2 13 Kyle "You will?
"
2 13 Kyle "We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "What are we gonna do with them?
"
2 13 Kyle "..What the-?
"
2 13 Kyle "After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
2 13 Kyle "Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
"
2 14 Kyle "What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 14 Kyle "He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
"
2 14 Kyle "He singing some new hit song.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, then you should get money for it!
"
2 14 Kyle "Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
"
2 14 Kyle "It’s the same goddamn song!
"
2 14 Kyle "We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
"
2 14 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 14 Kyle "I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
"
2 14 Kyle "What's going on?
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "What's that, dude?
"
2 14 Kyle "Did you ever know any famous people?
"
2 14 Kyle "You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, b-but how?
"
2 14 Kyle "Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
"
2 14 Kyle "Are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, dude.
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
"
2 14 Kyle "He’s not dying, Cartman!
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Do you know him?
"
2 14 Kyle "Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
"
2 14 Kyle "We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
"
2 14 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude… Chef is gone.
"
2 14 Kyle "But what are we gonna do?
"
2 14 Kyle "Chef Aid?
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's a great idea!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, cool!
"
2 14 Kyle "We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
"
2 14 Kyle "Well, we helped.
"
2 14 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
"
2 15 Kyle "He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
"
2 15 Kyle "Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
"
2 15 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Where have you been, dude?
"
2 15 Kyle "Aunt Flo?
"
2 15 Kyle "Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
"
2 15 Kyle "Here he comes.
"
2 15 Kyle "You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, at least he's back to normal.
"
2 15 Kyle "It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
"
2 15 Kyle "That's not cool!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
2 15 Kyle "God, will you shut up?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 15 Kyle "I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
"
2 15 Kyle "You seem tired, Stan.
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Hoh, that sucks, dude.
"
2 15 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "You can't be standing there, Cartman.
"
2 15 Kyle "Because you're standing over there! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, Chef?
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef!
"
2 15 Kyle "We have problems!
"
2 15 Kyle "Will you stop saying that word?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
"
2 15 Kyle "There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
2 15 Kyle "What?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Like what?
"
2 15 Kyle "You kick ass, evil Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Leave him alone, butthole!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's the evil pets 
"
2 15 Kyle "We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Which one is the good Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Oh no, dude!
"
2 15 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop.
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop!
"
2 16 Kyle "What's all that stuff?
"
2 16 Kyle "Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh, God! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus Christ, finally!
"
2 16 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 16 Kyle "That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, your family died?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?!
"
2 16 Kyle "What is this??
"
2 16 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Aaww!
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I know what you mean. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh. Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I heard it, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "I wanted to make sure, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, it's coming through the window! 
"
2 16 Kyle "We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Yeah, they do!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
"
2 16 Kyle "Good for you, Charlie!
"
2 16 Kyle "Do you see him?
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "So?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Hoh, boy. Here we go!
"
2 16 Kyle "You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
2 16 Kyle "This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?! What did you say?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Behold! Here's your false prophet!
"
2 16 Kyle "It was a fake!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
"
2 16 Kyle "God, I hate the holiday season! 
"
2 16 Kyle "What's your mom doing here, dude?
"
2 16 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 17 Kyle "We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're his oral report buddies.
"
2 17 Kyle "Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Kyle "Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Man, this stuff is strong.
"
2 17 Kyle "Don't worry about it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
"
2 17 Kyle "Woohoo! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
"
2 17 Kyle "Killer!! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hogh, my stomach hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sure. 
"
2 17 Kyle "Thanks, dude.
"
2 17 Kyle "Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
"
2 17 Kyle """And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
2 17 Kyle "And that's our report, I guess.
"
2 17 Kyle "I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
"
2 17 Kyle "Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
2 17 Kyle "My butt hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uh...
"
2 17 Kyle "I don't like big corporations.
"
2 17 Kyle "Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
2 17 Kyle "So what are we gonna say?
"
2 17 Kyle "Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?
"
2 17 Kyle "Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
"
2 17 Kyle "Sshh, don't scare him.
"
2 17 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 17 Kyle "Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
"
2 17 Kyle "Show us.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sooo, what's phase 2?
"
2 17 Kyle "Do you guys know anything about corporations?
"
2 17 Kyle "You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
"
2 17 Kyle "What?
"
2 17 Kyle "Big corporations are good!
"
2 17 Kyle "Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go, dude, go! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"
2 18 Kyle "That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
"
2 18 Kyle "Get away from me, Cartman! 
"
2 18 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAA! 
"
2 18 Kyle "HELP! 
"
2 18 Kyle "You guuuys!
"
2 18 Kyle "I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"
2 18 Kyle "Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't think so.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sick, dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude, it's a dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Wow. Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"
2 18 Kyle "No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "It's my name, and I found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
"
2 18 Kyle "Kenny, who found the ice man?
"
2 18 Kyle "But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Kyle "We came for our reward.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sweet. How about Steve?
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
"
2 18 Kyle "Gorak's a gay name.
"
2 18 Kyle "Why are you being such a dick?
"
2 18 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
2 18 Kyle "I'll go.
"
2 18 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 18 Kyle "Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
"
2 18 Kyle "Fine! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No, he sure doesn't.
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
"
2 18 Kyle "He's my creature!
"
2 18 Kyle "But it isn't right!
"
2 18 Kyle "What?! I'm not talking to you! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I'm here to bust out Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
"
2 18 Kyle "Does so!
"
2 18 Kyle "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, wait!
"
2 18 Kyle "I've got something to show Steve, dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
"
2 18 Kyle "It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Kyle "No you don't, butthole! 
"
2 18 Kyle "We have to get our friend, Steve-
"
2 18 Kyle "Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. First one to die, loses.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. 
"
2 18 Kyle "So, here we go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Ow! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
"
2 18 Kyle "Later.
"
2 18 Kyle "Uhuh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name... is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve! Steve, look out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, look out! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I can't believe he's gone.
"
2 18 Kyle "Hey!
"
2 18 Kyle "No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "Me, too. He sucks.
"
2 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 2 Kyle "He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
"
2 2 Kyle "What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
2 2 Kyle "Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
"
2 2 Kyle "Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "Really?
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing away
"
2 2 Kyle "Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 2 Kyle "Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
"
2 2 Kyle "Stan!
"
2 2 Kyle "Hey, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing ay...
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
"
2 2 Kyle "Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
"
2 2 Kyle "D'you have any wire here?
"
2 2 Kyle "No, he'll die!
"
2 2 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 2 Kyle "He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know. Let's find out.
"
2 3 Kyle "Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow, these books look cool!
"
2 3 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
"
2 3 Kyle "It looks like a note.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude, what's going on?
"
2 3 Kyle "How about a brain transplant? 
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"
2 3 Kyle "Oh no! 
"
2 3 Kyle "What's it say?
"
2 3 Kyle "Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""
"
2 3 Kyle "Here! Here, I found one!
"
2 3 Kyle "It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
2 3 Kyle "How's it goin', dude?
"
2 3 Kyle "Just read the sentence.
"
2 3 Kyle "Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
2 3 Kyle "He's here!
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
2 3 Kyle "So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
"
2 3 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 3 Kyle "Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 3 Kyle "I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
"
2 3 Kyle "It's poetic justice.
"
2 4 Kyle "We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, it's his bris.
"
2 4 Kyle "I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
2 4 Kyle "Uhhh... I'm not sure.
"
2 4 Kyle "Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
"
2 4 Kyle "How's it going?
"
2 4 Kyle "Why bad?
"
2 4 Kyle "Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
2 4 Kyle "No.
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, not ham, you fat fuck!
"
2 4 Kyle "Your heart?
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Stop who?
"
2 4 Kyle "What?
"
2 4 Kyle "Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
"
2 4 Kyle "That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
"
2 4 Kyle "I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom! Dad!
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
"
2 4 Kyle "Meaning what?
"
2 4 Kyle "AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
2 4 Kyle "I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
2 4 Kyle "I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
"
2 4 Kyle "Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
"
2 4 Kyle "You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
"
2 4 Kyle "I need one ticket for my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 4 Kyle "But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"
2 4 Kyle "They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
"
2 4 Kyle "Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
2 4 Kyle "Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
"
2 4 Kyle "There, what do you think?
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
2 4 Kyle "Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"
2 4 Kyle "Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
"
2 4 Kyle "Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
"
2 4 Kyle "No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Put him down, you stupid dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
"
2 4 Kyle "What??
"
2 4 Kyle "You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
"
2 4 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Aw, how the hell should I know?
"
2 4 Kyle "All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah, right.
"
2 4 Kyle "He's not my brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm sorry, Ike. 
"
2 4 Kyle "What do you want?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
"
2 4 Kyle "No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
"
2 4 Kyle "Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
"
2 4 Kyle "You stay away from my little brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
"
2 4 Kyle "And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"
2 4 Kyle "No!  No, it isn't true!
"
2 4 Kyle "It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
"
2 4 Kyle "Ike, you're okay. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
"
2 4 Kyle "And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
"
2 4 Kyle "M'kay?
"
2 5 Kyle "We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"
2 5 Kyle "No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
"
2 5 Kyle "I caught it! I caught it!
"
2 5 Kyle "Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
"
2 5 Kyle "Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
"
2 5 Kyle "Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No, it'll be okay!
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh-- Noooo!
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "I know.
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh!  Phew.
"
2 5 Kyle "Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
"
2 5 Kyle "AAGGGGGHHHH!!
"
2 5 Kyle "OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
"
2 5 Kyle "AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
"
2 5 Kyle "...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No-it looked dead.
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
"
2 5 Kyle "And then she walked over to--
"
2 5 Kyle "Uhhhh... Yeah. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
"
2 5 Kyle "Go for it, Pip. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
"
2 5 Kyle "Get him, Frenchy!
"
2 5 Kyle "Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
"
2 5 Kyle "Wow, that was easy.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
"
2 5 Kyle "Know what?
"
2 5 Kyle "But we could get killed!
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, what does that mean?
"
2 5 Kyle "Yeah, you're from China.
"
2 5 Kyle "But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
"
2 5 Kyle "You... bastards...
"
2 5 Kyle "What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
"
2 5 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 5 Kyle "Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
2 6 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
2 6 Kyle "Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
"
2 6 Kyle "Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"
2 6 Kyle "Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
2 6 Kyle "F-minus? Can he do that?
"
2 6 Kyle "How do you know? You weren't even there.
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
"
2 6 Kyle "We've got to get him back, dude.
"
2 6 Kyle "Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
"
2 6 Kyle "Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
"
2 6 Kyle "Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Der, Cartman!
"
2 6 Kyle "Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
2 6 Kyle "'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
2 6 Kyle "Look! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
"
2 6 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 6 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
2 6 Kyle "Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"
2 7 Kyle "Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
"
2 7 Kyle "I know, but, it's really snowy today.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
"
2 7 Kyle "I'm scared!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
"
2 7 Kyle "'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
"
2 7 Kyle "I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
"
2 7 Kyle "We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
2 7 Kyle "What?
"
2 7 Kyle "Worse than this?
"
2 7 Kyle "How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
2 7 Kyle "Fart, damn you!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, look at that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
"
2 7 Kyle "You can say that again.
"
2 7 Kyle "Nope.
"
2 7 Kyle "Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude! 
"
2 7 Kyle "On Wednesday or Thursday?
"
2 7 Kyle "Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He's making ice cream. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
"
2 7 Kyle "What was what?
"
2 7 Kyle "What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey yeah, I remember that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
2 7 Kyle "You... bastard? 
"
2 7 Kyle "Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 7 Kyle "We've just gotta stick together.
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
"
2 7 Kyle "What are we gonna do?
"
2 7 Kyle "There.  I think we got it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh no!
"
2 7 Kyle "Hello?
"
2 7 Kyle "Really?
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
"
2 8 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
"
2 8 Kyle "Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
"
2 8 Kyle "We wanna buy M-80s.
"
2 8 Kyle "What a baby.
"
2 8 Kyle "What do ya mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
"
2 8 Kyle "Oo bastards! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
2 8 Kyle "Let's go, dude. We're ready.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
"
2 8 Kyle "Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dusty the dirtball
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yup. 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
"
2 8 Kyle "Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
"
2 8 Kyle "I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! That thing is huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Kenny! Watch out! 
"
2 8 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 8 Kyle "What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
"
2 8 Kyle "What'd he say?
"
2 8 Kyle "How is that gonna help?
"
2 8 Kyle "A lot, I think.
"
2 8 Kyle "I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
"
2 8 Kyle "We're bored.
"
2 8 Kyle "Wow! These are huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look! It's snowing! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
"
2 9 Kyle "They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
"
2 9 Kyle "Sick, Kenny.
"
2 9 Kyle "All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
"
2 9 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 9 Kyle "If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"
2 9 Kyle "I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
"
2 9 Kyle "I'm poopies, ma!
"
2 9 Kyle "Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
"
2 9 Kyle "Could it be?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
"
2 9 Kyle "It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, I'm sure it was him.
"
2 9 Kyle "So how was that movie last night, dude?
"
2 9 Kyle "Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Well?
"
2 9 Kyle "There it is again! 
"
2 9 Kyle "It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Where does that grill go?
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
"
2 9 Kyle "We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
"
2 9 Kyle "What the hell? 
"
2 9 Kyle "In a sewer?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "I told you guys he'd be here!
"
2 9 Kyle "What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
"
2 9 Kyle "And that's why you got a cold?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
"
2 9 Kyle "Aaahh!
"
2 9 Kyle "Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
"
2 9 Kyle "He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Huh??
"
2 9 Kyle "Dude, no one even listened to me.
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
2 9 Kyle "We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
"
2 9 Kyle "It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
2 9 Kyle "Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
"
2 9 Kyle "You guys, we have to hurry!
"
2 9 Kyle "Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
"
2 9 Kyle "I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
"
2 9 Kyle "I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
"
2 9 Kyle "You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooohohohohohoho-
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yes?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo!
"
2 9 Kyle "Noo! No!
"
2 9 Kyle "Uuf.
"
2 9 Kyle "I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"
2 9 Kyle "Chef, does poo go to heaven?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "He's back! He's back! 
"
2 9 Kyle "You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
"
2 9 Kyle "No! 
"
2 9 Kyle "O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
"
2 9 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 9 Kyle "You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you guys having a meeting or something?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
"
2 10 Kyle "I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
2 10 Kyle "Heheheh, buns.
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
"
2 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell is that?
"
2 10 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. I feel great!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yes. Why?
"
2 10 Kyle "No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
"
2 10 Kyle "Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
"
2 10 Kyle "Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
2 10 Kyle "Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
"
2 10 Kyle "But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
"
2 10 Kyle "Gods and clods?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
"
2 10 Kyle "Could we go home now, Ma?
"
2 10 Kyle "But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"
2 10 Kyle "What's ""ookie mouth""?
"
2 10 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 10 Kyle "Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
"
2 10 Kyle "Argh!
"
2 10 Kyle "I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
"
2 10 Kyle "What the hell does that have to do with American history?
"
2 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
"
2 10 Kyle """So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""
"
2 10 Kyle "What?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
"
2 10 Kyle "You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Stan! Stan!
"
2 10 Kyle "Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
"
2 10 Kyle "Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
"
2 10 Kyle "Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
2 10 Kyle "No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
"
2 10 Kyle "Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
"
2 10 Kyle "Do you know anybody with herpes?
"
2 10 Kyle "Cool! Thanks, Chef!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you old Frida?
"
2 10 Kyle "Someone who wants a favor.
"
2 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 10 Kyle "Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
"
2 10 Kyle "D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
2 10 Kyle "Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
"
2 10 Kyle "Ugh... 
"
2 10 Kyle "We're sorry.
"
2 10 Kyle "This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
"
2 10 Kyle "I'm better now. 
"
2 10 Kyle "We gave you guys herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
"
2 11 Kyle "To where?
"
2 11 Kyle "Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
"
2 11 Kyle "You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
"
2 11 Kyle "I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""
"
2 11 Kyle "Hey, who are you?
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoopie.
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
"
2 11 Kyle "Me too. It was sweet.
"
2 11 Kyle "Did what?
"
2 11 Kyle "My head still feels funny.
"
2 11 Kyle "Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
2 11 Kyle "Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
"
2 11 Kyle "I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"
2 11 Kyle "Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
"
2 11 Kyle "I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
"
2 11 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 11 Kyle "Sshh!
"
2 11 Kyle "Why?
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, yeah.
"
2 11 Kyle "Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "What does that do?
"
2 11 Kyle "Kenny! What's it doing? 
"
2 11 Kyle "We're bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
"
2 11 Kyle "But it's true, dude!
"
2 11 Kyle "Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
"
2 11 Kyle "He's not highly intelligent.
"
2 11 Kyle "Cartman! You saved us! 
"
2 11 Kyle "He got a full dose of the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah! You're dead!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
"
2 12 Kyle "Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
2 12 Kyle "I dunno.
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "We do?
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
"
2 12 Kyle "What? Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
"
2 12 Kyle "It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
2 12 Kyle "Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "Good guess, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
"
2 12 Kyle "To me??
"
2 12 Kyle "We should use nails, dude.
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
"
2 12 Kyle "Right. Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Too eager to what?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah?
"
2 12 Kyle "Umm. Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
"
2 12 Kyle "It's just wrong, that's all.
"
2 12 Kyle "What the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
2 12 Kyle "Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay, that's fine.
"
2 12 Kyle "But I don't care.
"
2 12 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 13 Kyle "Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
2 13 Kyle "You suck, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "But ih-
"
2 13 Kyle "Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Mom, give me some money!
"
2 13 Kyle "I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "I will if you give me money!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
"
2 13 Kyle "Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"
2 13 Kyle "No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "You'd better be right, dude.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 13 Kyle "That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"
2 13 Kyle "That was a waste of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
"
2 13 Kyle "This ride better be good!
"
2 13 Kyle "We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
"
2 13 Kyle "Finally!
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 13 Kyle "Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 13 Kyle "How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
"
2 13 Kyle "What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
"
2 13 Kyle "That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
"
2 13 Kyle "I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
"
2 13 Kyle "This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "It worked!
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
"
2 13 Kyle "What?!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
"
2 13 Kyle "Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
"
2 13 Kyle "All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
"
2 13 Kyle "You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
"
2 13 Kyle "What'd you say, Cartman??
"
2 13 Kyle "I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay, Cartman. You ready?
"
2 13 Kyle "Open the gate! 
"
2 13 Kyle "That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
"
2 13 Kyle "Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
"
2 13 Kyle "That's better.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
"
2 13 Kyle "No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, I think we broke him.
"
2 13 Kyle "..Oh.
"
2 13 Kyle "We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 13 Kyle "You think?
"
2 13 Kyle "He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, I think so.
"
2 13 Kyle "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
"
2 13 Kyle "Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
"
2 13 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 13 Kyle "Hang on, Cartman! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Go help him, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 13 Kyle "How many ball does that get us?
"
2 13 Kyle "You will?
"
2 13 Kyle "We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "What are we gonna do with them?
"
2 13 Kyle "..What the-?
"
2 13 Kyle "After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
2 13 Kyle "Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
"
2 14 Kyle "What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 14 Kyle "He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
"
2 14 Kyle "He singing some new hit song.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, then you should get money for it!
"
2 14 Kyle "Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
"
2 14 Kyle "It’s the same goddamn song!
"
2 14 Kyle "We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
"
2 14 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 14 Kyle "I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
"
2 14 Kyle "What's going on?
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "What's that, dude?
"
2 14 Kyle "Did you ever know any famous people?
"
2 14 Kyle "You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, b-but how?
"
2 14 Kyle "Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
"
2 14 Kyle "Are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, dude.
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
"
2 14 Kyle "He’s not dying, Cartman!
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Do you know him?
"
2 14 Kyle "Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
"
2 14 Kyle "We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
"
2 14 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude… Chef is gone.
"
2 14 Kyle "But what are we gonna do?
"
2 14 Kyle "Chef Aid?
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's a great idea!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, cool!
"
2 14 Kyle "We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
"
2 14 Kyle "Well, we helped.
"
2 14 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
"
2 15 Kyle "He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
"
2 15 Kyle "Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
"
2 15 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Where have you been, dude?
"
2 15 Kyle "Aunt Flo?
"
2 15 Kyle "Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
"
2 15 Kyle "Here he comes.
"
2 15 Kyle "You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, at least he's back to normal.
"
2 15 Kyle "It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
"
2 15 Kyle "That's not cool!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
2 15 Kyle "God, will you shut up?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 15 Kyle "I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
"
2 15 Kyle "You seem tired, Stan.
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Hoh, that sucks, dude.
"
2 15 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "You can't be standing there, Cartman.
"
2 15 Kyle "Because you're standing over there! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, Chef?
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef!
"
2 15 Kyle "We have problems!
"
2 15 Kyle "Will you stop saying that word?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
"
2 15 Kyle "There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
2 15 Kyle "What?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Like what?
"
2 15 Kyle "You kick ass, evil Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Leave him alone, butthole!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's the evil pets 
"
2 15 Kyle "We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Which one is the good Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Oh no, dude!
"
2 15 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop.
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop!
"
2 16 Kyle "What's all that stuff?
"
2 16 Kyle "Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh, God! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus Christ, finally!
"
2 16 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 16 Kyle "That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, your family died?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?!
"
2 16 Kyle "What is this??
"
2 16 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Aaww!
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I know what you mean. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh. Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I heard it, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "I wanted to make sure, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, it's coming through the window! 
"
2 16 Kyle "We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Yeah, they do!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
"
2 16 Kyle "Good for you, Charlie!
"
2 16 Kyle "Do you see him?
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "So?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Hoh, boy. Here we go!
"
2 16 Kyle "You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
2 16 Kyle "This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?! What did you say?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Behold! Here's your false prophet!
"
2 16 Kyle "It was a fake!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
"
2 16 Kyle "God, I hate the holiday season! 
"
2 16 Kyle "What's your mom doing here, dude?
"
2 16 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 17 Kyle "We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're his oral report buddies.
"
2 17 Kyle "Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Kyle "Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Man, this stuff is strong.
"
2 17 Kyle "Don't worry about it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
"
2 17 Kyle "Woohoo! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
"
2 17 Kyle "Killer!! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hogh, my stomach hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sure. 
"
2 17 Kyle "Thanks, dude.
"
2 17 Kyle "Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
"
2 17 Kyle """And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
2 17 Kyle "And that's our report, I guess.
"
2 17 Kyle "I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
"
2 17 Kyle "Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
2 17 Kyle "My butt hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uh...
"
2 17 Kyle "I don't like big corporations.
"
2 17 Kyle "Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
2 17 Kyle "So what are we gonna say?
"
2 17 Kyle "Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?
"
2 17 Kyle "Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
"
2 17 Kyle "Sshh, don't scare him.
"
2 17 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 17 Kyle "Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
"
2 17 Kyle "Show us.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sooo, what's phase 2?
"
2 17 Kyle "Do you guys know anything about corporations?
"
2 17 Kyle "You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
"
2 17 Kyle "What?
"
2 17 Kyle "Big corporations are good!
"
2 17 Kyle "Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go, dude, go! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"
2 18 Kyle "That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
"
2 18 Kyle "Get away from me, Cartman! 
"
2 18 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAA! 
"
2 18 Kyle "HELP! 
"
2 18 Kyle "You guuuys!
"
2 18 Kyle "I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"
2 18 Kyle "Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't think so.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sick, dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude, it's a dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Wow. Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"
2 18 Kyle "No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "It's my name, and I found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
"
2 18 Kyle "Kenny, who found the ice man?
"
2 18 Kyle "But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Kyle "We came for our reward.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sweet. How about Steve?
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
"
2 18 Kyle "Gorak's a gay name.
"
2 18 Kyle "Why are you being such a dick?
"
2 18 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
2 18 Kyle "I'll go.
"
2 18 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 18 Kyle "Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
"
2 18 Kyle "Fine! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No, he sure doesn't.
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
"
2 18 Kyle "He's my creature!
"
2 18 Kyle "But it isn't right!
"
2 18 Kyle "What?! I'm not talking to you! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I'm here to bust out Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
"
2 18 Kyle "Does so!
"
2 18 Kyle "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, wait!
"
2 18 Kyle "I've got something to show Steve, dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
"
2 18 Kyle "It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Kyle "No you don't, butthole! 
"
2 18 Kyle "We have to get our friend, Steve-
"
2 18 Kyle "Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. First one to die, loses.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. 
"
2 18 Kyle "So, here we go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Ow! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
"
2 18 Kyle "Later.
"
2 18 Kyle "Uhuh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name... is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve! Steve, look out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, look out! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I can't believe he's gone.
"
2 18 Kyle "Hey!
"
2 18 Kyle "No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "Me, too. He sucks.
"
2 2 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 2 Kyle "He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
"
2 2 Kyle "What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
2 2 Kyle "Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
"
2 2 Kyle "Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "Really?
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing away
"
2 2 Kyle "Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 2 Kyle "Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
"
2 2 Kyle "Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
"
2 2 Kyle "Stan!
"
2 2 Kyle "Hey, Cartman.
"
2 2 Kyle "I'm sailing ay...
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
"
2 2 Kyle "Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
"
2 2 Kyle "D'you have any wire here?
"
2 2 Kyle "No, he'll die!
"
2 2 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 2 Kyle "He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
"
2 2 Kyle "I don't know. Let's find out.
"
2 3 Kyle "Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow, these books look cool!
"
2 3 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
"
2 3 Kyle "It looks like a note.
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude, what's going on?
"
2 3 Kyle "How about a brain transplant? 
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"
2 3 Kyle "Oh no! 
"
2 3 Kyle "What's it say?
"
2 3 Kyle "Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""
"
2 3 Kyle "Here! Here, I found one!
"
2 3 Kyle "It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
2 3 Kyle "How's it goin', dude?
"
2 3 Kyle "Just read the sentence.
"
2 3 Kyle "Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
"
2 3 Kyle "Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
2 3 Kyle "He's here!
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
2 3 Kyle "So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
"
2 3 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 3 Kyle "Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
"
2 3 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 3 Kyle "I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
"
2 3 Kyle "Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
"
2 3 Kyle "It's poetic justice.
"
2 4 Kyle "We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, it's his bris.
"
2 4 Kyle "I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
2 4 Kyle "Uhhh... I'm not sure.
"
2 4 Kyle "Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
"
2 4 Kyle "How's it going?
"
2 4 Kyle "Why bad?
"
2 4 Kyle "Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
2 4 Kyle "No.
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
"
2 4 Kyle "No, not ham, you fat fuck!
"
2 4 Kyle "Your heart?
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Stop who?
"
2 4 Kyle "What?
"
2 4 Kyle "Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
"
2 4 Kyle "That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
"
2 4 Kyle "I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom! Dad!
"
2 4 Kyle "Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
"
2 4 Kyle "Meaning what?
"
2 4 Kyle "AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
2 4 Kyle "I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
2 4 Kyle "I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
"
2 4 Kyle "Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
"
2 4 Kyle "You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
"
2 4 Kyle "I need one ticket for my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 4 Kyle "But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"
2 4 Kyle "They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
"
2 4 Kyle "Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
2 4 Kyle "Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
"
2 4 Kyle "There, what do you think?
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
2 4 Kyle "Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"
2 4 Kyle "Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
"
2 4 Kyle "Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
"
2 4 Kyle "No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Put him down, you stupid dog!
"
2 4 Kyle "Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
"
2 4 Kyle "What??
"
2 4 Kyle "You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
"
2 4 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 4 Kyle "Aw, how the hell should I know?
"
2 4 Kyle "All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah, right.
"
2 4 Kyle "He's not my brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "I'm sorry, Ike. 
"
2 4 Kyle "What do you want?!
"
2 4 Kyle "Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
"
2 4 Kyle "No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
"
2 4 Kyle "Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
"
2 4 Kyle "You stay away from my little brother!
"
2 4 Kyle "You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
"
2 4 Kyle "And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"
2 4 Kyle "No!  No, it isn't true!
"
2 4 Kyle "It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
"
2 4 Kyle "Ike, you're okay. 
"
2 4 Kyle "Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
"
2 4 Kyle "And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
"
2 4 Kyle "M'kay?
"
2 5 Kyle "We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"
2 5 Kyle "No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
"
2 5 Kyle "I caught it! I caught it!
"
2 5 Kyle "Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
"
2 5 Kyle "Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
"
2 5 Kyle "Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No, it'll be okay!
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh-- Noooo!
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "Ye-yes.
"
2 5 Kyle "I know.
"
2 5 Kyle "Oh!  Phew.
"
2 5 Kyle "Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
"
2 5 Kyle "AAGGGGGHHHH!!
"
2 5 Kyle "OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
"
2 5 Kyle "AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
"
2 5 Kyle "...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
"
2 5 Kyle "No. No-it looked dead.
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
"
2 5 Kyle "And then she walked over to--
"
2 5 Kyle "Uhhhh... Yeah. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
"
2 5 Kyle "Go for it, Pip. 
"
2 5 Kyle "Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
"
2 5 Kyle "Get him, Frenchy!
"
2 5 Kyle "Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
"
2 5 Kyle "Wow, that was easy.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
"
2 5 Kyle "Know what?
"
2 5 Kyle "But we could get killed!
"
2 5 Kyle "Dude, what does that mean?
"
2 5 Kyle "Yeah, you're from China.
"
2 5 Kyle "But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
"
2 5 Kyle "You... bastards...
"
2 5 Kyle "What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
"
2 5 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 5 Kyle "Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
"
2 5 Kyle "Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
2 6 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
2 6 Kyle "Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
"
2 6 Kyle "Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"
2 6 Kyle "Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
2 6 Kyle "F-minus? Can he do that?
"
2 6 Kyle "How do you know? You weren't even there.
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
"
2 6 Kyle "We've got to get him back, dude.
"
2 6 Kyle "Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
"
2 6 Kyle "Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
"
2 6 Kyle "Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Der, Cartman!
"
2 6 Kyle "Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
2 6 Kyle "'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
2 6 Kyle "Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
2 6 Kyle "Look! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
"
2 6 Kyle "Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
"
2 6 Kyle "Who are you?
"
2 6 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
"
2 6 Kyle "Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
2 6 Kyle "Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"
2 7 Kyle "Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
"
2 7 Kyle "I know, but, it's really snowy today.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
"
2 7 Kyle "I'm scared!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
"
2 7 Kyle "'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
"
2 7 Kyle "I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
"
2 7 Kyle "We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
2 7 Kyle "What?
"
2 7 Kyle "Worse than this?
"
2 7 Kyle "How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure you do!
"
2 7 Kyle "Fart, damn you!
"
2 7 Kyle "Whoa, look at that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
"
2 7 Kyle "You can say that again.
"
2 7 Kyle "Nope.
"
2 7 Kyle "Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude! 
"
2 7 Kyle "On Wednesday or Thursday?
"
2 7 Kyle "Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude! He's making ice cream. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
"
2 7 Kyle "What was what?
"
2 7 Kyle "What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey yeah, I remember that.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
2 7 Kyle "You... bastard? 
"
2 7 Kyle "Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 7 Kyle "We've just gotta stick together.
"
2 7 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 7 Kyle "Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
"
2 7 Kyle "What are we gonna do?
"
2 7 Kyle "There.  I think we got it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
"
2 7 Kyle "Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"
2 7 Kyle "Don't do it, kid. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
"
2 7 Kyle "Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
"
2 7 Kyle "Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
"
2 7 Kyle "Oh no!
"
2 7 Kyle "Hello?
"
2 7 Kyle "Really?
"
2 7 Kyle "Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
"
2 7 Kyle "Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
"
2 8 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
"
2 8 Kyle "Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
"
2 8 Kyle "We wanna buy M-80s.
"
2 8 Kyle "What a baby.
"
2 8 Kyle "What do ya mean?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
"
2 8 Kyle "Oo bastards! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah!
"
2 8 Kyle "Let's go, dude. We're ready.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
"
2 8 Kyle "Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dusty the dirtball
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
"
2 8 Kyle "Yup. 
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
"
2 8 Kyle "Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
"
2 8 Kyle "Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
"
2 8 Kyle "I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
"
2 8 Kyle "Dude! That thing is huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Kenny! Watch out! 
"
2 8 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 8 Kyle "What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
"
2 8 Kyle "What'd he say?
"
2 8 Kyle "How is that gonna help?
"
2 8 Kyle "A lot, I think.
"
2 8 Kyle "I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
"
2 8 Kyle "We're bored.
"
2 8 Kyle "Wow! These are huge!
"
2 8 Kyle "Hey, look! It's snowing! 
"
2 8 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
"
2 9 Kyle "They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
"
2 9 Kyle "Sick, Kenny.
"
2 9 Kyle "All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
"
2 9 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 9 Kyle "If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"
2 9 Kyle "I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
"
2 9 Kyle "I'm poopies, ma!
"
2 9 Kyle "Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
"
2 9 Kyle "Could it be?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
"
2 9 Kyle "It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, I'm sure it was him.
"
2 9 Kyle "So how was that movie last night, dude?
"
2 9 Kyle "Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Well?
"
2 9 Kyle "There it is again! 
"
2 9 Kyle "It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Where does that grill go?
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
"
2 9 Kyle "Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
"
2 9 Kyle "We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
"
2 9 Kyle "What the hell? 
"
2 9 Kyle "In a sewer?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!
"
2 9 Kyle "I told you guys he'd be here!
"
2 9 Kyle "What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
"
2 9 Kyle "And that's why you got a cold?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
"
2 9 Kyle "Aaahh!
"
2 9 Kyle "Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
"
2 9 Kyle "He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
"
2 9 Kyle "Huh??
"
2 9 Kyle "Dude, no one even listened to me.
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
2 9 Kyle "We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
"
2 9 Kyle "It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
2 9 Kyle "Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
"
2 9 Kyle "Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
"
2 9 Kyle "You guys, we have to hurry!
"
2 9 Kyle "Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
"
2 9 Kyle "I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
"
2 9 Kyle "I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
"
2 9 Kyle "You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
"
2 9 Kyle "Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooohohohohohoho-
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "What is it?
"
2 9 Kyle "Yes?
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Nooo!
"
2 9 Kyle "Noo! No!
"
2 9 Kyle "Uuf.
"
2 9 Kyle "I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"
2 9 Kyle "Chef, does poo go to heaven?
"
2 9 Kyle "Mr. Hankey?
"
2 9 Kyle "He's back! He's back! 
"
2 9 Kyle "You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
"
2 9 Kyle "Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
"
2 9 Kyle "Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
"
2 9 Kyle "No! 
"
2 9 Kyle "O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
"
2 9 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 9 Kyle "You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you guys having a meeting or something?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
"
2 10 Kyle "I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
2 10 Kyle "Heheheh, buns.
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
"
2 10 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, what the hell is that?
"
2 10 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. I feel great!
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yes. Why?
"
2 10 Kyle "No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
"
2 10 Kyle "Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
"
2 10 Kyle "Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
2 10 Kyle "Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
"
2 10 Kyle "But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
"
2 10 Kyle "Gods and clods?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
"
2 10 Kyle "Could we go home now, Ma?
"
2 10 Kyle "But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"
2 10 Kyle "What's ""ookie mouth""?
"
2 10 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 10 Kyle "Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
"
2 10 Kyle "Argh!
"
2 10 Kyle "I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
"
2 10 Kyle "What the hell does that have to do with American history?
"
2 10 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
"
2 10 Kyle """So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""
"
2 10 Kyle "What?
"
2 10 Kyle "Oh my God!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You!
"
2 10 Kyle "You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
"
2 10 Kyle "You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Stan! Stan!
"
2 10 Kyle "Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
"
2 10 Kyle "Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
"
2 10 Kyle "They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
"
2 10 Kyle "Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"
2 10 Kyle "Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
"
2 10 Kyle "Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
2 10 Kyle "No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
"
2 10 Kyle "Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
"
2 10 Kyle "Do you know anybody with herpes?
"
2 10 Kyle "Cool! Thanks, Chef!
"
2 10 Kyle "Are you old Frida?
"
2 10 Kyle "Someone who wants a favor.
"
2 10 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 10 Kyle "Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
"
2 10 Kyle "D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
2 10 Kyle "Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
"
2 10 Kyle "Ugh... 
"
2 10 Kyle "We're sorry.
"
2 10 Kyle "This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
"
2 10 Kyle "I'm better now. 
"
2 10 Kyle "We gave you guys herpes.
"
2 10 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
"
2 11 Kyle "To where?
"
2 11 Kyle "Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
"
2 11 Kyle "You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
"
2 11 Kyle "I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""
"
2 11 Kyle "Hey, who are you?
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoopie.
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
"
2 11 Kyle "Me too. It was sweet.
"
2 11 Kyle "Did what?
"
2 11 Kyle "My head still feels funny.
"
2 11 Kyle "Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
"
2 11 Kyle "Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
2 11 Kyle "Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
"
2 11 Kyle "Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
"
2 11 Kyle "I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"
2 11 Kyle "Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
"
2 11 Kyle "I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
"
2 11 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 11 Kyle "Sshh!
"
2 11 Kyle "Why?
"
2 11 Kyle "Oh, yeah.
"
2 11 Kyle "Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "What does that do?
"
2 11 Kyle "Kenny! What's it doing? 
"
2 11 Kyle "We're bastards!
"
2 11 Kyle "We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
"
2 11 Kyle "But it's true, dude!
"
2 11 Kyle "Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
"
2 11 Kyle "He's not highly intelligent.
"
2 11 Kyle "Cartman! You saved us! 
"
2 11 Kyle "He got a full dose of the stars.
"
2 11 Kyle "Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah! You're dead!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
"
2 12 Kyle "Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
2 12 Kyle "I dunno.
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "We do?
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
"
2 12 Kyle "Whoa, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
"
2 12 Kyle "What? Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
"
2 12 Kyle "It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
2 12 Kyle "Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "Fine!
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 12 Kyle "Good guess, dude!
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
"
2 12 Kyle "To me??
"
2 12 Kyle "We should use nails, dude.
"
2 12 Kyle "Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
"
2 12 Kyle "Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
"
2 12 Kyle "Right. Why?
"
2 12 Kyle "Too eager to what?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Yeah?
"
2 12 Kyle "Umm. Dare?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?
"
2 12 Kyle "What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
"
2 12 Kyle "It's just wrong, that's all.
"
2 12 Kyle "What the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
2 12 Kyle "Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 12 Kyle "Huh?
"
2 12 Kyle "Okay, that's fine.
"
2 12 Kyle "But I don't care.
"
2 12 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 13 Kyle "Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, that kicks ass!
"
2 13 Kyle "You suck, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "But ih-
"
2 13 Kyle "Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
"
2 13 Kyle "Mom, give me some money!
"
2 13 Kyle "I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "I will if you give me money!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
"
2 13 Kyle "Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"
2 13 Kyle "No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2 13 Kyle "You'd better be right, dude.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay.
"
2 13 Kyle "That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"
2 13 Kyle "That was a waste of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
"
2 13 Kyle "This ride better be good!
"
2 13 Kyle "We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
"
2 13 Kyle "Finally!
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 13 Kyle "Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dumbass, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "No, it's not cool!
"
2 13 Kyle "How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
"
2 13 Kyle "What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
"
2 13 Kyle "You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
"
2 13 Kyle "That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
"
2 13 Kyle "I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
"
2 13 Kyle "This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
"
2 13 Kyle "It worked!
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
"
2 13 Kyle "What?!
"
2 13 Kyle "You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
"
2 13 Kyle "Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
"
2 13 Kyle "All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
"
2 13 Kyle "You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
"
2 13 Kyle "What'd you say, Cartman??
"
2 13 Kyle "I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
"
2 13 Kyle "Okay, Cartman. You ready?
"
2 13 Kyle "Open the gate! 
"
2 13 Kyle "That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
"
2 13 Kyle "Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
"
2 13 Kyle "That's better.
"
2 13 Kyle "Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
"
2 13 Kyle "No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Dude, I think we broke him.
"
2 13 Kyle "..Oh.
"
2 13 Kyle "We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
"
2 13 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 13 Kyle "You think?
"
2 13 Kyle "He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"
2 13 Kyle "Yeah, I think so.
"
2 13 Kyle "Hey, where's Cartman?
"
2 13 Kyle "He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
"
2 13 Kyle "Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
"
2 13 Kyle "What do you mean?
"
2 13 Kyle "Hang on, Cartman! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Go help him, Kenny!
"
2 13 Kyle "You bastard! 
"
2 13 Kyle "How many ball does that get us?
"
2 13 Kyle "You will?
"
2 13 Kyle "We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2 13 Kyle "What are we gonna do with them?
"
2 13 Kyle "..What the-?
"
2 13 Kyle "After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
"
2 13 Kyle "Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
2 13 Kyle "Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
2 13 Kyle "Really? What about?
"
2 13 Kyle "No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
"
2 14 Kyle "What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2 14 Kyle "He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
"
2 14 Kyle "He singing some new hit song.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, then you should get money for it!
"
2 14 Kyle "Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
"
2 14 Kyle "It’s the same goddamn song!
"
2 14 Kyle "We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
"
2 14 Kyle "I don't know.
"
2 14 Kyle "I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
"
2 14 Kyle "What's going on?
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "What's that, dude?
"
2 14 Kyle "Did you ever know any famous people?
"
2 14 Kyle "You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, b-but how?
"
2 14 Kyle "Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
"
2 14 Kyle "Are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
"
2 14 Kyle "We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah, dude.
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
"
2 14 Kyle "He’s not dying, Cartman!
"
2 14 Kyle "Yeah. Do you know him?
"
2 14 Kyle "Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
"
2 14 Kyle "We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
"
2 14 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 14 Kyle "But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
"
2 14 Kyle "Dude… Chef is gone.
"
2 14 Kyle "But what are we gonna do?
"
2 14 Kyle "Chef Aid?
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's a great idea!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
"
2 14 Kyle "Wow, cool!
"
2 14 Kyle "We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
"
2 14 Kyle "Well, we helped.
"
2 14 Kyle "You bastard!
"
2 14 Kyle "Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
"
2 15 Kyle "He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
"
2 15 Kyle "Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
"
2 15 Kyle "What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Where have you been, dude?
"
2 15 Kyle "Aunt Flo?
"
2 15 Kyle "Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
"
2 15 Kyle "Here he comes.
"
2 15 Kyle "You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, at least he's back to normal.
"
2 15 Kyle "It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
"
2 15 Kyle "That's not cool!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
2 15 Kyle "God, will you shut up?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 15 Kyle "I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
"
2 15 Kyle "You seem tired, Stan.
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Hoh, that sucks, dude.
"
2 15 Kyle "Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "You can't be standing there, Cartman.
"
2 15 Kyle "Because you're standing over there! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Uh, Chef?
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef.
"
2 15 Kyle "Chef!
"
2 15 Kyle "We have problems!
"
2 15 Kyle "Will you stop saying that word?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
"
2 15 Kyle "There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
"
2 15 Kyle "Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
2 15 Kyle "What?
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""
"
2 15 Kyle "Why?
"
2 15 Kyle "Like what?
"
2 15 Kyle "You kick ass, evil Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""
"
2 15 Kyle "Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
"
2 15 Kyle "Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!
"
2 15 Kyle "Leave him alone, butthole!
"
2 15 Kyle "It's the evil pets 
"
2 15 Kyle "We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
"
2 15 Kyle "Which one is the good Cartman?
"
2 15 Kyle "Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
"
2 15 Kyle "Oh no, dude!
"
2 15 Kyle "Damn it!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop.
"
2 16 Kyle "Please stop!
"
2 16 Kyle "What's all that stuff?
"
2 16 Kyle "Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cool!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh, God! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus Christ, finally!
"
2 16 Kyle "Agghh!
"
2 16 Kyle "That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, your family died?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?!
"
2 16 Kyle "What is this??
"
2 16 Kyle "Sick, dude!
"
2 16 Kyle "Whoa, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Aaww!
"
2 16 Kyle "Jesus, dude! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I know what you mean. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
"
2 16 Kyle "Oh. Arrggh! 
"
2 16 Kyle "I heard it, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "I wanted to make sure, too.
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, it's coming through the window! 
"
2 16 Kyle "We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
"
2 16 Kyle "Yeah, they do!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
"
2 16 Kyle "Good for you, Charlie!
"
2 16 Kyle "Do you see him?
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"
2 16 Kyle "That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
"
2 16 Kyle "So?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
"
2 16 Kyle "Hoh, boy. Here we go!
"
2 16 Kyle "You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
2 16 Kyle "This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
"
2 16 Kyle "What?! What did you say?!
"
2 16 Kyle "Behold! Here's your false prophet!
"
2 16 Kyle "It was a fake!
"
2 16 Kyle "Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"
2 16 Kyle "I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
"
2 16 Kyle "God, I hate the holiday season! 
"
2 16 Kyle "What's your mom doing here, dude?
"
2 16 Kyle "You bastards! 
"
2 16 Kyle "Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah.
"
2 17 Kyle "We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
"
2 17 Kyle "Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're his oral report buddies.
"
2 17 Kyle "Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
"
2 17 Kyle "We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"
2 17 Kyle "Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Man, this stuff is strong.
"
2 17 Kyle "Don't worry about it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
"
2 17 Kyle "Woohoo! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
"
2 17 Kyle "Killer!! 
"
2 17 Kyle "Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
"
2 17 Kyle "Hogh, my stomach hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sure. 
"
2 17 Kyle "Thanks, dude.
"
2 17 Kyle "Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
"
2 17 Kyle """And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
2 17 Kyle "And that's our report, I guess.
"
2 17 Kyle "I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
"
2 17 Kyle "Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
"
2 17 Kyle "Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
2 17 Kyle "My butt hurts.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uh...
"
2 17 Kyle "I don't like big corporations.
"
2 17 Kyle "Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
2 17 Kyle "So what are we gonna say?
"
2 17 Kyle "Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
"
2 17 Kyle "Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?
"
2 17 Kyle "Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
"
2 17 Kyle "Sshh, don't scare him.
"
2 17 Kyle "Cartman!
"
2 17 Kyle "Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
"
2 17 Kyle "Show us.
"
2 17 Kyle "Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"
2 17 Kyle "Sooo, what's phase 2?
"
2 17 Kyle "Do you guys know anything about corporations?
"
2 17 Kyle "You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
"
2 17 Kyle "What?
"
2 17 Kyle "Big corporations are good!
"
2 17 Kyle "Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
"
2 17 Kyle "Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go, dude, go! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"
2 18 Kyle "That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
"
2 18 Kyle "Get away from me, Cartman! 
"
2 18 Kyle "AAAAAAAAAA! 
"
2 18 Kyle "HELP! 
"
2 18 Kyle "You guuuys!
"
2 18 Kyle "I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"
2 18 Kyle "Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't think so.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sick, dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
"
2 18 Kyle "Dude, it's a dude! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Wow. Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
"
2 18 Kyle "I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"
2 18 Kyle "No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "It's my name, and I found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
"
2 18 Kyle "Kenny, who found the ice man?
"
2 18 Kyle "But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2 18 Kyle "We came for our reward.
"
2 18 Kyle "Sweet. How about Steve?
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
"
2 18 Kyle "Gorak's a gay name.
"
2 18 Kyle "Why are you being such a dick?
"
2 18 Kyle "Nuh-uh!
"
2 18 Kyle "I'll go.
"
2 18 Kyle "You bastards!
"
2 18 Kyle "Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
"
2 18 Kyle "Fine! 
"
2 18 Kyle "No, he sure doesn't.
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
"
2 18 Kyle "He's my creature!
"
2 18 Kyle "But it isn't right!
"
2 18 Kyle "What?! I'm not talking to you! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I'm here to bust out Steve.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
"
2 18 Kyle "Does so!
"
2 18 Kyle "You're a dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
2 18 Kyle "Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, wait!
"
2 18 Kyle "I've got something to show Steve, dick!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
"
2 18 Kyle "It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
"
2 18 Kyle "No you don't, butthole! 
"
2 18 Kyle "We have to get our friend, Steve-
"
2 18 Kyle "Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. First one to die, loses.
"
2 18 Kyle "Okay. 
"
2 18 Kyle "So, here we go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Go. 
"
2 18 Kyle "Ow! 
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
"
2 18 Kyle "Later.
"
2 18 Kyle "Uhuh.
"
2 18 Kyle "Cool.
"
2 18 Kyle "His name... is Steve!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve! Steve, look out!
"
2 18 Kyle "Steve, look out! 
"
2 18 Kyle "I can't believe he's gone.
"
2 18 Kyle "Hey!
"
2 18 Kyle "No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
"
2 18 Kyle "Me, too. He sucks.
"
