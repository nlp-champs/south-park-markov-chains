16 1 Butters "Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
"
16 1 Butters "My grandma is from Virginia. 
"
16 1 Butters "A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
"
16 2 Butters "Whoops!

16 3 Butters "What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
16 3 Butters "Well, count me out.

16 3 Butters "Well, I'm scared.

16 3 Butters "Oh, that's okay. I think...

"
16 4 Butters "AAAAAAHHH!

16 4 Butters "Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
"
16 4 Butters "AAAAAHHH!
"
16 4 Butters "No, it's a school night!
"
16 4 Butters "You think Jewpacabra is here?
"
16 4 Butters "Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
"
16 4 Butters "Oh God, I'm scared.
"
16 4 Butters "Eric, stop it!
"
16 4 Butters "I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
"
16 4 Butters "Jesus is a lie?
"
16 4 Butters "Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"
16 4 Butters "Oh, hamburgers.
"
16 4 Butters "It's all quiet out front, Eric.
"
16 4 Butters "He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
"
16 4 Butters "Hey, Eric.
"
16 4 Butters "Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
"
16 4 Butters "Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
"
16 4 Butters "Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
"
16 5 Butters "Heh, h-hey fellas. 
"
16 5 Butters "OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
"
16 5 Butters "...Yeah.

16 5 Butters "HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
"
16 5 Butters "Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
"
16 5 Butters "Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
"
16 5 Butters "Yes...
"
16 5 Butters "Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
"
16 5 Butters "Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
"
16 5 Butters "Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
"
16 5 Butters "Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 
"
16 5 Butters "Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 
"
16 5 Butters "HAAAAA! 
"
16 5 Butters "We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me!

16 5 Butters "Please, leave me alone.
"
16 5 Butters "No it doesn't.
"
16 5 Butters "Stop it!
"
16 5 Butters "Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
"
16 7 Butters "Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
"
16 7 Butters "Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
"
16 7 Butters "Guess!
"
16 7 Butters "There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"
16 7 Butters "Theh theh, there she is. 
"
16 7 Butters "How come?
"
16 7 Butters "Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
"
16 7 Butters "Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
"
16 7 Butters "It's gonna be okay, Eric.
"
16 7 Butters "They'll find love somewhere else.
"
16 7 Butters "Yes, they will.
"
16 7 Butters "In...in who, Eric?
"
16 8 Butters "Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
"
16 8 Butters "That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
"
16 8 Butters "I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
"
16 8 Butters "Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
"
16 8 Butters "Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
16 8 Butters "This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
"
16 8 Butters "Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
"
16 8 Butters "And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
16 8 Butters "And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
"
16 8 Butters "Huh?
"
16 8 Butters "Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
"
16 8 Butters "Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
"
16 8 Butters "'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
16 8 Butters "I love you too, ladies. 
"
16 8 Butters "Woohoohoohoohoo!
"
16 8 Butters "Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
"
16 8 Butters "I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
"
16 8 Butters "Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
"
16 8 Butters "Wuh sure, Eric. 
"
16 8 Butters "Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
16 8 Butters "Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
"
16 8 Butters "...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
"
16 8 Butters "My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
16 8 Butters "I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
"
16 8 Butters "Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"
16 8 Butters "All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
"
16 8 Butters "Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
"
16 8 Butters "Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
"
16 8 Butters "Like me!
"
16 8 Butters "42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
"
16 8 Butters "Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
"
16 8 Butters "What's sarcasm and what's com?
"
16 8 Butters "DAD! Hey Dad!
"
16 8 Butters "My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"
16 8 Butters "Thanks, Dad.
"
16 11 Butters "Leave me alone!
"
16 11 Butters "Get out of here, all of ya! 
"
16 11 Butters "You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
"
16 11 Butters "And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"
16 11 Butters "Double wow! 
"
16 11 Butters "I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"
16 11 Butters "I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
"
16 11 Butters "Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
"
16 11 Butters "It's not?!
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah?
"
16 11 Butters "Hey yeah, all the time.
"
16 11 Butters "Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
"
16 11 Butters "Uhbu-but I'm from here.
"
16 11 Butters "We're from Hawaii?
"
16 11 Butters "But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"
16 11 Butters "They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
"
16 11 Butters "I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!
"
16 11 Butters "Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"
16 11 Butters "Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
"
16 11 Butters "Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
"
16 11 Butters "Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah?
"
16 11 Butters "Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
"
16 11 Butters "Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
"
16 11 Butters "You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
"
16 11 Butters "What's ""saimin""?
"
16 11 Butters "Whoa, it's like gasoline!
"
16 11 Butters "Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
"
16 11 Butters "I've never done this before. 
"
16 11 Butters "Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
"
16 11 Butters "No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
"
16 11 Butters "He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
"
16 11 Butters "Kenny, be careful!
"
16 11 Butters "Kenny!
"
16 11 Butters "Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
"
16 11 Butters "Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
16 11 Butters "Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"
16 11 Butters "Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
"
16 11 Butters "Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
"
16 11 Butters "No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
16 11 Butters "What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
"
16 12 Butters "Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"
16 12 Butters "I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
"
16 12 Butters "Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"
16 12 Butters "That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
"
16 12 Butters "Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
"
16 12 Butters "Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
"
16 13 Butters "Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?""
"
16 13 Butters "And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.""
"
16 13 Butters "Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
"
16 13 Butters "Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
"
16 13 Butters "Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
"
16 13 Butters "I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
"
16 13 Butters "He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
"
16 13 Butters "Who?
"
16 13 Butters "Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
"
16 13 Butters "Go Stan!
"
16 13 Butters "...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
"
16 13 Butters "Prostitute!
"
16 13 Butters "Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
"
16 13 Butters "Yeeah. Is it true?
"
16 13 Butters "Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
16 13 Butters "Wu-what sound?
"
16 14 Butters "Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
"
16 14 Butters "Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
"
16 14 Butters "He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
"
16 14 Butters "I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"
16 14 Butters "It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
"
16 14 Butters "Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
"
16 14 Butters "Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 
"
16 14 Butters "What's up fellas?
"
16 14 Butters "Bleh, ogayedmi.
"
16 14 Butters "AGH! No! Please! You can't!
"
16 14 Butters "Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
16 14 Butters "At Red Robster. 
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "I didn't say anything. I promise.
"
16 14 Butters "Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
"
16 1 Butters "Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
"
16 1 Butters "My grandma is from Virginia. 
"
16 1 Butters "A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
"
16 2 Butters "Whoops! 
"
16 2 Butters "Sorry. My arms hurt.
"
16 2 Butters "We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
"
16 2 Butters "Oh sorry, sorry. 
"
16 2 Butters "Sorry!

16 3 Butters "Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.

16 3 Butters "We got it. We got it!

16 3 Butters "What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
16 3 Butters "Well, count me out.

16 3 Butters "Well, I'm scared. 
"
16 3 Butters "Oh, that's okay. I think...
"
16 3 Butters "HA?!
"
16 4 Butters "Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
"
16 4 Butters "You mean it's like, like a monster?
"
16 4 Butters "AAAAAAHHH!

16 4 Butters "No, it's a school night!

16 4 Butters "You think Jewpacabra is here?

16 4 Butters "Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?

"
16 5 Butters "Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma.

16 7 Butters "Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
"
16 7 Butters "Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
"
16 7 Butters "Guess!
"
16 7 Butters "There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"
16 7 Butters "Theh theh, there she is. 
"
16 7 Butters "How come?
"
16 7 Butters "Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
"
16 7 Butters "Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
"
16 7 Butters "It's gonna be okay, Eric.
"
16 7 Butters "They'll find love somewhere else.
"
16 7 Butters "Yes, they will.
"
16 7 Butters "In...in who, Eric?
"
16 8 Butters "Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
"
16 8 Butters "That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
"
16 8 Butters "I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
"
16 8 Butters "Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
"
16 8 Butters "Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
16 8 Butters "This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
"
16 8 Butters "Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
"
16 8 Butters "And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
16 8 Butters "And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
"
16 8 Butters "Huh?
"
16 8 Butters "Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
"
16 8 Butters "Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
"
16 8 Butters "'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
16 8 Butters "I love you too, ladies. 
"
16 8 Butters "Woohoohoohoohoo!
"
16 8 Butters "Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
"
16 8 Butters "I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
"
16 8 Butters "Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
"
16 8 Butters "Wuh sure, Eric. 
"
16 8 Butters "Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
16 8 Butters "Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
"
16 8 Butters "...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
"
16 8 Butters "My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
16 8 Butters "I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
"
16 8 Butters "Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"
16 8 Butters "All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
"
16 8 Butters "Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
"
16 8 Butters "Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
"
16 8 Butters "Like me!
"
16 8 Butters "42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
"
16 8 Butters "Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
"
16 8 Butters "What's sarcasm and what's com?
"
16 8 Butters "DAD! Hey Dad!
"
16 8 Butters "My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"
16 8 Butters "Thanks, Dad.
"
16 11 Butters "Leave me alone!
"
16 11 Butters "Get out of here, all of ya! 
"
16 11 Butters "You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
"
16 11 Butters "And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"
16 11 Butters "Double wow! 
"
16 11 Butters "I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"
16 11 Butters "I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
"
16 11 Butters "Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
"
16 11 Butters "It's not?!
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah?
"
16 11 Butters "Hey yeah, all the time.
"
16 11 Butters "Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
"
16 11 Butters "Uhbu-but I'm from here.
"
16 11 Butters "We're from Hawaii?
"
16 11 Butters "But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"
16 11 Butters "They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
"
16 11 Butters "I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!
"
16 11 Butters "Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"
16 11 Butters "Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
"
16 11 Butters "Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
"
16 11 Butters "Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah?
"
16 11 Butters "Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
"
16 11 Butters "Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
"
16 11 Butters "You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
"
16 11 Butters "What's ""saimin""?
"
16 11 Butters "Whoa, it's like gasoline!
"
16 11 Butters "Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
"
16 11 Butters "I've never done this before. 
"
16 11 Butters "Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
"
16 11 Butters "No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
"
16 11 Butters "He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
"
16 11 Butters "Kenny, be careful!
"
16 11 Butters "Kenny!
"
16 11 Butters "Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
"
16 11 Butters "Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
16 11 Butters "Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"
16 11 Butters "Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
"
16 11 Butters "Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
"
16 11 Butters "No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
16 11 Butters "What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
"
16 11 Butters "Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
"
16 12 Butters "Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"
16 12 Butters "I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
"
16 12 Butters "Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"
16 12 Butters "That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
"
16 12 Butters "Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
"
16 12 Butters "Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
"
16 13 Butters "Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?""
"
16 13 Butters "And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.""
"
16 13 Butters "Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
"
16 13 Butters "Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
"
16 13 Butters "Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
"
16 13 Butters "I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
"
16 13 Butters "He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
"
16 13 Butters "Who?
"
16 13 Butters "Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
"
16 13 Butters "Go Stan!
"
16 13 Butters "...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
"
16 13 Butters "Prostitute!
"
16 13 Butters "Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
"
16 13 Butters "Yeeah. Is it true?
"
16 13 Butters "Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
16 13 Butters "Wu-what sound?
"
16 14 Butters "Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
"
16 14 Butters "Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
"
16 14 Butters "He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
"
16 14 Butters "I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"
16 14 Butters "It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
"
16 14 Butters "Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
"
16 14 Butters "Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 
"
16 14 Butters "What's up fellas?
"
16 14 Butters "Bleh, ogayedmi.
"
16 14 Butters "AGH! No! Please! You can't!
"
16 14 Butters "Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
16 14 Butters "At Red Robster. 
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "Red Lobster!
"
16 14 Butters "I didn't say anything. I promise.
"
16 14 Butters "Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
