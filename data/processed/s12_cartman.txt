12 1 Cartman "AHHHHHH.
"
12 1 Cartman "What?
"
12 1 Cartman "No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
"
12 1 Cartman "...Ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
12 1 Cartman "Uh. It's over?
"
12 1 Cartman "Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, so where's my ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean?!
"
12 1 Cartman "I HAVE AIDS?
"
12 1 Cartman """SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
12 1 Cartman "No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
12 1 Cartman "God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
12 1 Cartman "Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
12 1 Cartman "Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
"
12 1 Cartman "Where the hell is everybody? 
"
12 1 Cartman "So this is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
"
12 1 Cartman "Just bring out Elton John already!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jimmy Buffett?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "No you don't!
"
12 1 Cartman "If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Ironic how?
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
"
12 1 Cartman "Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, what?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Nothing!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kind of.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
12 1 Cartman "Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
12 1 Cartman "He was a basketball player.
"
12 1 Cartman "So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
12 1 Cartman "My God...
"
12 1 Cartman "We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
"
12 1 Cartman "Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
12 1 Cartman "Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
12 1 Cartman "I know. I'm scared too.
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
12 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you sure?
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, no!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
"
12 1 Cartman "What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
12 2 Cartman "Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
12 2 Cartman "Aw dude, that's our town!
"
12 2 Cartman "That's enough to buy slaves!
"
12 2 Cartman "Sweet!
"
12 2 Cartman "We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
12 2 Cartman "All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
12 3 Cartman "Cat pee? 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Okay, ready Kenny?
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
12 3 Cartman "Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
12 3 Cartman "Ah, Kenny! 
"
12 3 Cartman "Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
12 3 Cartman "Yeah, who has cats these days? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Who is it?!
"
12 3 Cartman "Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
12 3 Cartman "I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
12 3 Cartman "What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
12 3 Cartman "Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
12 3 Cartman "He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
12 3 Cartman "They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
12 3 Cartman "But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
12 4 Cartman "Oh God, I'm bored already.
"
12 4 Cartman "Gayness! 
"
12 4 Cartman "We don't care. *urp*
"
12 4 Cartman "God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
12 4 Cartman "No! NOOO!
"
12 4 Cartman "How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
12 4 Cartman "Wait. I've got it.
"
12 4 Cartman "There's more people viewing it!
"
12 4 Cartman "Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
"
12 4 Cartman "Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
"
12 4 Cartman "Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
12 4 Cartman "Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
12 4 Cartman "...You are a homo, Butters.
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
12 5 Cartman "Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
12 5 Cartman "Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! 
"
12 5 Cartman "That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
12 5 Cartman "That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
"
12 5 Cartman "Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
"
12 5 Cartman "Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
12 5 Cartman "Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
12 5 Cartman "Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
12 5 Cartman "I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
"
12 5 Cartman "No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
12 5 Cartman "Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Nice form, compadre. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
12 5 Cartman "What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
12 5 Cartman "Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.
"
12 5 Cartman "Good. Again.
"
12 5 Cartman "Again!
"
12 5 Cartman "Now you sound like white people!
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #27 is 5.
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #28 is 14.
"
12 5 Cartman "All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
12 5 Cartman "Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
12 5 Cartman "Uh what?
"
12 5 Cartman "Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
12 5 Cartman "You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
12 5 Cartman "I reeached these keeeds.
"
12 7 Cartman "Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
12 7 Cartman "Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
12 7 Cartman "God damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "That isn't necessary!
"
12 7 Cartman "You can let go now, Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, come on!
"
12 7 Cartman "I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
12 7 Cartman "Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then let go of my hand!
"
12 7 Cartman "Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
12 7 Cartman "All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
12 7 Cartman "Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw, just a few more things.
"
12 7 Cartman "Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
12 7 Cartman "Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
12 7 Cartman "They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
12 7 Cartman "Shhh! Butters!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
"
12 7 Cartman "All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
12 7 Cartman "If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "All right, come on! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
12 7 Cartman "Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
"
12 7 Cartman "It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
"
12 7 Cartman "Save me!
"
12 7 Cartman "... Oh dude, laaame.
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
12 7 Cartman "Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
12 7 Cartman "Ready? Go! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
12 7 Cartman "Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
12 7 Cartman "What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ! 
"
12 7 Cartman "AAAAH! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
12 8 Cartman "They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
"
12 8 Cartman "There you are, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "Butters, I need your help.
"
12 8 Cartman "The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
12 8 Cartman "I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
12 8 Cartman "You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
"
12 8 Cartman "Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
12 8 Cartman "So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
"
12 8 Cartman "You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
12 8 Cartman "This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
12 8 Cartman "They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
"
12 8 Cartman "So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
12 8 Cartman "Ting ton teetong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
12 8 Cartman "All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
12 8 Cartman "What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
12 8 Cartman "...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
12 8 Cartman "Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
12 8 Cartman "Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
12 8 Cartman "Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
"
12 8 Cartman "Shoot him, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
"
12 8 Cartman "Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
12 8 Cartman "Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
12 8 Cartman "No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
12 8 Cartman "God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
12 8 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
12 8 Cartman "...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
12 8 Cartman "No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Good! Did you kill him? 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude...
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
12 8 Cartman "You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
12 8 Cartman "I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
12 8 Cartman "I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
12 9 Cartman "She said it again. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
12 9 Cartman "Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
12 9 Cartman "Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
12 9 Cartman "Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
12 9 Cartman "Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
12 9 Cartman "Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
"
12 9 Cartman "You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup?  Whassup?
"
12 9 Cartman "Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're gonna fight me after school?
"
12 9 Cartman "You're a chick, dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh, it's on, bitch!
"
12 9 Cartman "She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
12 9 Cartman "I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
12 9 Cartman "Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
"
12 9 Cartman "Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
12 9 Cartman "Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
12 9 Cartman "My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Eat my underwear?
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
12 9 Cartman "No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
12 9 Cartman "Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
12 9 Cartman "So...  are we cool?
"
12 9 Cartman "I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
"
12 9 Cartman "Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
12 9 Cartman "Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
12 9 Cartman "God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Detention! That's it! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Ahhh, sweet.
"
12 9 Cartman "What?! That's ridiculous!
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not why I did it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
"
12 9 Cartman "Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Huh?
"
12 9 Cartman "The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
12 9 Cartman "The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
"
12 9 Cartman "What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Why not? You chicken? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
12 9 Cartman "I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
12 9 Cartman "Told you guys.
"
12 9 Cartman "Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
12 9 Cartman "What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, Wendy.
"
12 9 Cartman "Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
"
12 9 Cartman "Butters, get out of here!
"
12 9 Cartman "...Huh? 
"
12 9 Cartman "What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
12 9 Cartman "Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
12 9 Cartman "All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
12 9 Cartman "You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
12 9 Cartman "Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah, me too. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shut up already!
"
12 10 Cartman "I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
12 10 Cartman "So?
"
12 10 Cartman "How much?
"
12 10 Cartman "Really? Are you sure?
"
12 10 Cartman "Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
12 10 Cartman "Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
12 10 Cartman "Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
"
12 10 Cartman "All right Craig! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, don't be an asshole.
"
12 10 Cartman "And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
12 10 Cartman "Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
"
12 10 Cartman "No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
12 10 Cartman "No! No es bueno! 
"
12 10 Cartman "No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
"
12 10 Cartman "Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we're White.
"
12 10 Cartman "You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
12 10 Cartman "There's no talking to this guy.
"
12 11 Cartman "You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
12 11 Cartman "Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
12 11 Cartman "That's right.
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
12 11 Cartman "What is it?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
12 11 Cartman "Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, it's Craig!
"
12 11 Cartman "Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, that's awesome.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
12 11 Cartman "Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
12 11 Cartman "That guy's an asshole!
"
12 12 Cartman "Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
12 13 Cartman "Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
12 13 Cartman "There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
12 13 Cartman "What the hell are they doing?
"
12 13 Cartman "Dude, girls are such fags. 
"
12 13 Cartman "This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
12 13 Cartman "Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
"
12 13 Cartman "Ehhhhhhh. 
"
12 13 Cartman "I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
"
12 13 Cartman "...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
12 13 Cartman "God this sucks!
"
12 13 Cartman "You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
12 13 Cartman "Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh God, shut up!
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
12 13 Cartman "No way dude.
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman """Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
12 13 Cartman """That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman "I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
12 13 Cartman "You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
12 13 Cartman "That's a low blow, Stan.
"
12 13 Cartman "But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
12 13 Cartman "And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
12 13 Cartman "Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh, who just shot me? 
"
12 14 Cartman "U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
12 14 Cartman "All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
12 14 Cartman "Yeah, now get out of here.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
12 14 Cartman "Butters?  Butters?! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
12 14 Cartman "Yes.
"
12 1 Cartman "AHHHHHH.
"
12 1 Cartman "What?
"
12 1 Cartman "No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
"
12 1 Cartman "...Ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
12 1 Cartman "Uh. It's over?
"
12 1 Cartman "Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, so where's my ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean?!
"
12 1 Cartman "I HAVE AIDS?
"
12 1 Cartman """SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
12 1 Cartman "No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
12 1 Cartman "God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
12 1 Cartman "Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
12 1 Cartman "Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
"
12 1 Cartman "Where the hell is everybody? 
"
12 1 Cartman "So this is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
"
12 1 Cartman "Just bring out Elton John already!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jimmy Buffett?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "No you don't!
"
12 1 Cartman "If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Ironic how?
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
"
12 1 Cartman "Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, what?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Nothing!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kind of.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
12 1 Cartman "Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
12 1 Cartman "He was a basketball player.
"
12 1 Cartman "So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
12 1 Cartman "My God...
"
12 1 Cartman "We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
"
12 1 Cartman "Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
12 1 Cartman "Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
12 1 Cartman "I know. I'm scared too.
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
12 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you sure?
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, no!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
"
12 1 Cartman "What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
12 2 Cartman "Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
12 2 Cartman "Aw dude, that's our town!
"
12 2 Cartman "That's enough to buy slaves!
"
12 2 Cartman "Sweet!
"
12 2 Cartman "We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
12 2 Cartman "All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
12 3 Cartman "Cat pee? 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Okay, ready Kenny?
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
12 3 Cartman "Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
12 3 Cartman "Ah, Kenny! 
"
12 3 Cartman "Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
12 3 Cartman "Yeah, who has cats these days? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Who is it?!
"
12 3 Cartman "Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
12 3 Cartman "I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
12 3 Cartman "What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
12 3 Cartman "Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
12 3 Cartman "He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
12 3 Cartman "They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
12 3 Cartman "But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
12 4 Cartman "Oh God, I'm bored already.
"
12 4 Cartman "Gayness! 
"
12 4 Cartman "We don't care. *urp*
"
12 4 Cartman "God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
12 4 Cartman "No! NOOO!
"
12 4 Cartman "How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
12 4 Cartman "Wait. I've got it.
"
12 4 Cartman "There's more people viewing it!
"
12 4 Cartman "Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
"
12 4 Cartman "Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
"
12 4 Cartman "Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
12 4 Cartman "Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
12 4 Cartman "...You are a homo, Butters.
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
12 5 Cartman "Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
12 5 Cartman "Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! 
"
12 5 Cartman "That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
12 5 Cartman "That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
"
12 5 Cartman "Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
"
12 5 Cartman "Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
12 5 Cartman "Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
12 5 Cartman "Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
12 5 Cartman "I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
"
12 5 Cartman "No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
12 5 Cartman "Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Nice form, compadre. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
12 5 Cartman "What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
12 5 Cartman "Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.
"
12 5 Cartman "Good. Again.
"
12 5 Cartman "Again!
"
12 5 Cartman "Now you sound like white people!
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #27 is 5.
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #28 is 14.
"
12 5 Cartman "All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
12 5 Cartman "Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
12 5 Cartman "Uh what?
"
12 5 Cartman "Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
12 5 Cartman "You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
12 5 Cartman "I reeached these keeeds.
"
12 7 Cartman "Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
12 7 Cartman "Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
12 7 Cartman "God damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "That isn't necessary!
"
12 7 Cartman "You can let go now, Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, come on!
"
12 7 Cartman "I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
12 7 Cartman "Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then let go of my hand!
"
12 7 Cartman "Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
12 7 Cartman "All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
12 7 Cartman "Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw, just a few more things.
"
12 7 Cartman "Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
12 7 Cartman "Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
12 7 Cartman "They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
12 7 Cartman "Shhh! Butters!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
"
12 7 Cartman "All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
12 7 Cartman "If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "All right, come on! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
12 7 Cartman "Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
"
12 7 Cartman "It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
"
12 7 Cartman "Save me!
"
12 7 Cartman "... Oh dude, laaame.
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
12 7 Cartman "Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
12 7 Cartman "Ready? Go! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
12 7 Cartman "Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
12 7 Cartman "What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ! 
"
12 7 Cartman "AAAAH! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
12 8 Cartman "They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
"
12 8 Cartman "There you are, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "Butters, I need your help.
"
12 8 Cartman "The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
12 8 Cartman "I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
12 8 Cartman "You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
"
12 8 Cartman "Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
12 8 Cartman "So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
"
12 8 Cartman "You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
12 8 Cartman "This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
12 8 Cartman "They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
"
12 8 Cartman "So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
12 8 Cartman "Ting ton teetong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
12 8 Cartman "All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
12 8 Cartman "What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
12 8 Cartman "...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
12 8 Cartman "Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
12 8 Cartman "Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
12 8 Cartman "Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
"
12 8 Cartman "Shoot him, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
"
12 8 Cartman "Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
12 8 Cartman "Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
12 8 Cartman "No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
12 8 Cartman "God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
12 8 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
12 8 Cartman "...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
12 8 Cartman "No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Good! Did you kill him? 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude...
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
12 8 Cartman "You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
12 8 Cartman "I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
12 8 Cartman "I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
12 9 Cartman "She said it again. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
12 9 Cartman "Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
12 9 Cartman "Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
12 9 Cartman "Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
12 9 Cartman "Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
12 9 Cartman "Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
"
12 9 Cartman "You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup?  Whassup?
"
12 9 Cartman "Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're gonna fight me after school?
"
12 9 Cartman "You're a chick, dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh, it's on, bitch!
"
12 9 Cartman "She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
12 9 Cartman "I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
12 9 Cartman "Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
"
12 9 Cartman "Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
12 9 Cartman "Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
12 9 Cartman "My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Eat my underwear?
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
12 9 Cartman "No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
12 9 Cartman "Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
12 9 Cartman "So...  are we cool?
"
12 9 Cartman "I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
"
12 9 Cartman "Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
12 9 Cartman "Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
12 9 Cartman "God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Detention! That's it! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Ahhh, sweet.
"
12 9 Cartman "What?! That's ridiculous!
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not why I did it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
"
12 9 Cartman "Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Huh?
"
12 9 Cartman "The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
12 9 Cartman "The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
"
12 9 Cartman "What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Why not? You chicken? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
12 9 Cartman "I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
12 9 Cartman "Told you guys.
"
12 9 Cartman "Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
12 9 Cartman "What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, Wendy.
"
12 9 Cartman "Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
"
12 9 Cartman "Butters, get out of here!
"
12 9 Cartman "...Huh? 
"
12 9 Cartman "What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
12 9 Cartman "Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
12 9 Cartman "All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
12 9 Cartman "You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
12 9 Cartman "Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah, me too. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shut up already!
"
12 10 Cartman "I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
12 10 Cartman "So?
"
12 10 Cartman "How much?
"
12 10 Cartman "Really? Are you sure?
"
12 10 Cartman "Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
12 10 Cartman "Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
12 10 Cartman "Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
"
12 10 Cartman "All right Craig! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, don't be an asshole.
"
12 10 Cartman "And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
12 10 Cartman "Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
"
12 10 Cartman "No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
12 10 Cartman "No! No es bueno! 
"
12 10 Cartman "No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
"
12 10 Cartman "Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we're White.
"
12 10 Cartman "You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
12 10 Cartman "There's no talking to this guy.
"
12 11 Cartman "You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
12 11 Cartman "Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
12 11 Cartman "That's right.
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
12 11 Cartman "What is it?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
12 11 Cartman "Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, it's Craig!
"
12 11 Cartman "Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, that's awesome.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
12 11 Cartman "Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
12 11 Cartman "That guy's an asshole!
"
12 12 Cartman "Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
12 13 Cartman "Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
12 13 Cartman "There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
12 13 Cartman "What the hell are they doing?
"
12 13 Cartman "Dude, girls are such fags. 
"
12 13 Cartman "This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
12 13 Cartman "Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
"
12 13 Cartman "Ehhhhhhh. 
"
12 13 Cartman "I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
"
12 13 Cartman "...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
12 13 Cartman "God this sucks!
"
12 13 Cartman "You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
12 13 Cartman "Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh God, shut up!
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
12 13 Cartman "No way dude.
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman """Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
12 13 Cartman """That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman "I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
12 13 Cartman "You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
12 13 Cartman "That's a low blow, Stan.
"
12 13 Cartman "But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
12 13 Cartman "And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
12 13 Cartman "Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh, who just shot me? 
"
12 14 Cartman "U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
12 14 Cartman "All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
12 14 Cartman "Yeah, now get out of here.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
12 14 Cartman "Butters?  Butters?! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
12 14 Cartman "Yes.
"
12 1 Cartman "AHHHHHH.
"
12 1 Cartman "What?
"
12 1 Cartman "No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
"
12 1 Cartman "...Ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
12 1 Cartman "Uh. It's over?
"
12 1 Cartman "Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, so where's my ice cream?
"
12 1 Cartman "You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean?!
"
12 1 Cartman "I HAVE AIDS?
"
12 1 Cartman """SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
12 1 Cartman "No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
12 1 Cartman "God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
12 1 Cartman "Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
12 1 Cartman "Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
"
12 1 Cartman "Where the hell is everybody? 
"
12 1 Cartman "So this is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
"
12 1 Cartman "Just bring out Elton John already!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jimmy Buffett?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
12 1 Cartman "Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
"
12 1 Cartman "Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "No you don't!
"
12 1 Cartman "If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Ironic how?
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
"
12 1 Cartman "Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, what?!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
12 1 Cartman "Nothing!
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kind of.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry.
"
12 1 Cartman "I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
12 1 Cartman "Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
12 1 Cartman "What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
12 1 Cartman "No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
12 1 Cartman "Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
"
12 1 Cartman "NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
12 1 Cartman "He was a basketball player.
"
12 1 Cartman "So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
12 1 Cartman "My God...
"
12 1 Cartman "We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
"
12 1 Cartman "Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
12 1 Cartman "Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
12 1 Cartman "Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
12 1 Cartman "No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
12 1 Cartman "I know. I'm scared too.
"
12 1 Cartman "We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12 1 Cartman "Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
12 1 Cartman "I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
"
12 1 Cartman "Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you sure?
"
12 1 Cartman "Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
12 1 Cartman "Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
"
12 1 Cartman "All right!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, no!
"
12 1 Cartman "What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
"
12 1 Cartman "What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
12 2 Cartman "Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
12 2 Cartman "Aw dude, that's our town!
"
12 2 Cartman "That's enough to buy slaves!
"
12 2 Cartman "Sweet!
"
12 2 Cartman "We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
12 2 Cartman "All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
12 3 Cartman "Cat pee? 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Okay, ready Kenny?
"
12 3 Cartman "All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
12 3 Cartman "Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
12 3 Cartman "Ah, Kenny! 
"
12 3 Cartman "Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
12 3 Cartman "Yeah, who has cats these days? 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
"
12 3 Cartman "All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Who is it?!
"
12 3 Cartman "Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
12 3 Cartman "I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
12 3 Cartman "What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
12 3 Cartman "Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
12 3 Cartman "He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
12 3 Cartman "They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
12 3 Cartman "But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
12 3 Cartman "Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
12 3 Cartman "Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
12 4 Cartman "Oh God, I'm bored already.
"
12 4 Cartman "Gayness! 
"
12 4 Cartman "We don't care. *urp*
"
12 4 Cartman "God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
12 4 Cartman "No! NOOO!
"
12 4 Cartman "How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
12 4 Cartman "Wait. I've got it.
"
12 4 Cartman "There's more people viewing it!
"
12 4 Cartman "Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
"
12 4 Cartman "Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
"
12 4 Cartman "Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
12 4 Cartman "Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
12 4 Cartman "...You are a homo, Butters.
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
12 5 Cartman "Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
12 5 Cartman "Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! 
"
12 5 Cartman "That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
12 5 Cartman "That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
"
12 5 Cartman "Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
"
12 5 Cartman "Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
12 5 Cartman "Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
12 5 Cartman "Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
12 5 Cartman "Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
12 5 Cartman "I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
"
12 5 Cartman "No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
12 5 Cartman "Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Nice form, compadre. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
12 5 Cartman "Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
12 5 Cartman "What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
12 5 Cartman "Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12 5 Cartman "Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
12 5 Cartman "Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.
"
12 5 Cartman "Good. Again.
"
12 5 Cartman "Again!
"
12 5 Cartman "Now you sound like white people!
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #27 is 5.
"
12 5 Cartman "The answer to #28 is 14.
"
12 5 Cartman "All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
12 5 Cartman "Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
12 5 Cartman "Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
12 5 Cartman "Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
12 5 Cartman "Uh what?
"
12 5 Cartman "Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
"
12 5 Cartman "How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
12 5 Cartman "You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
12 5 Cartman "I reeached these keeeds.
"
12 7 Cartman "Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
12 7 Cartman "Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
12 7 Cartman "God damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "That isn't necessary!
"
12 7 Cartman "You can let go now, Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, come on!
"
12 7 Cartman "I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
12 7 Cartman "Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then let go of my hand!
"
12 7 Cartman "Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
12 7 Cartman "Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
12 7 Cartman "All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
12 7 Cartman "Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
12 7 Cartman "Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
12 7 Cartman "Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Aw, just a few more things.
"
12 7 Cartman "Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
12 7 Cartman "Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
12 7 Cartman "Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
12 7 Cartman "They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
12 7 Cartman "Shhh! Butters!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
"
12 7 Cartman "All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
12 7 Cartman "If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "All right, come on! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
12 7 Cartman "Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
"
12 7 Cartman "It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
"
12 7 Cartman "Save me!
"
12 7 Cartman "... Oh dude, laaame.
"
12 7 Cartman "Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
12 7 Cartman "Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
12 7 Cartman "Ready? Go! 
"
12 7 Cartman "Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
12 7 Cartman "Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
12 7 Cartman "Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
12 7 Cartman "What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
12 7 Cartman "Butters.
"
12 7 Cartman "Jesus Christ! 
"
12 7 Cartman "AAAAH! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
12 8 Cartman "Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
12 8 Cartman "They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
"
12 8 Cartman "There you are, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "Butters, I need your help.
"
12 8 Cartman "The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
12 8 Cartman "I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
12 8 Cartman "You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
"
12 8 Cartman "Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
12 8 Cartman "So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
"
12 8 Cartman "You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
12 8 Cartman "All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
12 8 Cartman "This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
12 8 Cartman "They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
"
12 8 Cartman "So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
12 8 Cartman "Ting ton teetong.
"
12 8 Cartman "Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
12 8 Cartman "All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
12 8 Cartman "What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
12 8 Cartman "...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
12 8 Cartman "Oh my God...
"
12 8 Cartman "Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
12 8 Cartman "Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
12 8 Cartman "Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
12 8 Cartman "Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
"
12 8 Cartman "Shoot him, Butters!
"
12 8 Cartman "You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
"
12 8 Cartman "Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
12 8 Cartman "It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
12 8 Cartman "Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
12 8 Cartman "No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12 8 Cartman "One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
12 8 Cartman "No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
12 8 Cartman "God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
12 8 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
12 8 Cartman "...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
12 8 Cartman "No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
12 8 Cartman "Good! Did you kill him? 
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude...
"
12 8 Cartman "Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
12 8 Cartman "You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
12 8 Cartman "I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
12 8 Cartman "I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
12 9 Cartman "She said it again. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
12 9 Cartman "Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
12 9 Cartman "Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
12 9 Cartman "Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
12 9 Cartman "Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
12 9 Cartman "Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
"
12 9 Cartman "You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup?  Whassup?
"
12 9 Cartman "Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're gonna fight me after school?
"
12 9 Cartman "You're a chick, dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh, it's on, bitch!
"
12 9 Cartman "She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
12 9 Cartman "I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
12 9 Cartman "Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
12 9 Cartman "Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
"
12 9 Cartman "Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
12 9 Cartman "Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
12 9 Cartman "My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
12 9 Cartman "Eat my underwear?
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
12 9 Cartman "No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
12 9 Cartman "I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
12 9 Cartman "Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
12 9 Cartman "So...  are we cool?
"
12 9 Cartman "I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
"
12 9 Cartman "Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
12 9 Cartman "Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
"
12 9 Cartman "Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
12 9 Cartman "You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
12 9 Cartman "God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Detention! That's it! 
"
12 9 Cartman "Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Ahhh, sweet.
"
12 9 Cartman "What?! That's ridiculous!
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not why I did it.
"
12 9 Cartman "Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
"
12 9 Cartman "Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
12 9 Cartman "Huh?
"
12 9 Cartman "The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
12 9 Cartman "The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
12 9 Cartman "Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
"
12 9 Cartman "What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
12 9 Cartman "Why not? You chicken? 
"
12 9 Cartman "Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
12 9 Cartman "I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
12 9 Cartman "Told you guys.
"
12 9 Cartman "Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
12 9 Cartman "What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
12 9 Cartman "Wendy, Wendy.
"
12 9 Cartman "Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
"
12 9 Cartman "Butters, get out of here!
"
12 9 Cartman "...Huh? 
"
12 9 Cartman "What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
12 9 Cartman "Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
12 9 Cartman "All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
12 9 Cartman "You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
12 9 Cartman "You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
12 9 Cartman "Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
12 9 Cartman "If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
12 10 Cartman "Yeah, me too. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Shut up already!
"
12 10 Cartman "I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
12 10 Cartman "So?
"
12 10 Cartman "How much?
"
12 10 Cartman "Really? Are you sure?
"
12 10 Cartman "Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
12 10 Cartman "Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
12 10 Cartman "Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
"
12 10 Cartman "All right Craig! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
12 10 Cartman "Craig, don't be an asshole.
"
12 10 Cartman "And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
12 10 Cartman "Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
12 10 Cartman "Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey!

12 10 Cartman "No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
12 10 Cartman "No! No es bueno! 
"
12 10 Cartman "No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
"
12 10 Cartman "Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
12 10 Cartman "And we're White.
"
12 10 Cartman "You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
12 10 Cartman "There's no talking to this guy.
"
12 11 Cartman "You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
12 11 Cartman "Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
12 11 Cartman "That's right.
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
12 11 Cartman "What is it?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
12 11 Cartman "Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, it's Craig!
"
12 11 Cartman "Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
12 11 Cartman "Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, that's awesome.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
"
12 11 Cartman "Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
12 11 Cartman "Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
12 11 Cartman "That guy's an asshole!
"
12 12 Cartman "Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
12 13 Cartman "Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
12 13 Cartman "There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
12 13 Cartman "What the hell are they doing?
"
12 13 Cartman "Dude, girls are such fags. 
"
12 13 Cartman "This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
12 13 Cartman "Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
"
12 13 Cartman "Ehhhhhhh. 
"
12 13 Cartman "I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
"
12 13 Cartman "...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
12 13 Cartman "God this sucks!
"
12 13 Cartman "You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
12 13 Cartman "Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh God, shut up!
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
12 13 Cartman "Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
12 13 Cartman "No way dude.
"
12 13 Cartman "Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman """Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
12 13 Cartman """That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
12 13 Cartman "I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
12 13 Cartman "You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
12 13 Cartman "That's a low blow, Stan.
"
12 13 Cartman "But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
12 13 Cartman "And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
12 13 Cartman "Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh, who just shot me? 
"
12 14 Cartman "U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
12 14 Cartman "All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
12 14 Cartman "Yeah, now get out of here.
"
12 14 Cartman "Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
12 14 Cartman "Butters?  Butters?! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
12 14 Cartman "Dude! 
"
12 14 Cartman "Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
12 14 Cartman "Yes.
"
