15 12 Butters "Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
15 12 Butters "Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
15 12 Butters "I sure hope this works.
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
"
15 12 Butters "Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
15 13 Butters "Oh neato, huh fellas?
"
15 13 Butters "Thanksgiving is about murder?
"
15 13 Butters "Okay Dad.
"
15 14 Butters "Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
"
15 14 Butters "So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"
15 14 Butters "Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
15 14 Butters "Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.

"
15 10 Butters "Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
"
15 10 Butters "It's megasuperhilarious! 
"
15 10 Butters "Sick!
"
15 10 Butters "NO Wikileaks! Bad!
"
15 10 Butters "Biggest story about who?
"
15 10 Butters "There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 
"
15 10 Butters "Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
"
15 10 Butters "Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 
"
15 12 Butters "Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
15 12 Butters "Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
15 12 Butters "I sure hope this works.
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
"
15 12 Butters "Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
15 13 Butters "Oh neato, huh fellas?
"
15 13 Butters "Thanksgiving is about murder?
"
15 13 Butters "Okay Dad.
"
15 14 Butters "Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
"
15 14 Butters "So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"
15 14 Butters "Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
15 14 Butters "Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
"
15 14 Butters "Uh, I won't tell anybody.
"
15 1 Butters "You didn't read them?
"
15 1 Butters "Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
"
15 1 Butters """You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.""
"
15 1 Butters "Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user""
"
15 1 Butters """Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline.""
"
15 1 Butters "The Geniuses...
"
15 1 Butters "We know. It's preposterous.
"
15 1 Butters "The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
"
15 2 Butters "Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
"
15 2 Butters "Not again.
"
15 2 Butters "Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
"
15 2 Butters "Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"
15 4 Butters "And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
"
15 4 Butters "Skeletor is real??
"
15 4 Butters "Skeletor's a lady??
"
15 4 Butters "Hey Eric.
"
15 4 Butters "Is that really all our wiener sizes?
"
15 4 Butters "Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
"
15 4 Butters "A conspiracy?
"
15 4 Butters "Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
"
15 4 Butters "Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
"
15 4 Butters "Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
"
15 4 Butters "I'm hung like a horse!
"
15 4 Butters "Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
"
15 4 Butters "I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
"
15 4 Butters "Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!

15 6 Butters "Really?
"
15 6 Butters "Pardon me?
"
15 6 Butters "Yes!
"
15 6 Butters "This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
"
15 6 Butters "Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
"
15 6 Butters "Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.
"
15 6 Butters "Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
"
15 6 Butters "Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
"
15 6 Butters "Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
"
15 6 Butters "Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
"
15 6 Butters "Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
"
15 6 Butters "Huh?
"
15 6 Butters "Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-

15 6 Butters "This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
"
15 6 Butters "I'm trying, sir! 
"
15 6 Butters "What?
"
15 6 Butters "But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...

15 6 Butters "That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
"
15 6 Butters "Um, excuse me?
"
15 6 Butters "Wahh!
"
15 6 Butters "Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
"
15 6 Butters "What??
"
15 6 Butters "No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
"
15 6 Butters "It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
"
15 6 Butters "Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!

15 9 Butters "Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?
"
15 9 Butters "Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.

"
15 9 Butters "Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
"
15 9 Butters "So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
"
15 9 Butters "Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
"
15 9 Butters "Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?

15 12 Butters "Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
15 12 Butters "Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
15 12 Butters "Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
15 12 Butters "I sure hope this works.
"
15 12 Butters "Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
"
15 12 Butters "Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
15 13 Butters "Oh neato, huh fellas?
"
15 13 Butters "Thanksgiving is about murder?
"
15 13 Butters "Okay Dad.
"
15 14 Butters "Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.

"
15 14 Butters "Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
15 14 Butters "Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
"
15 14 Butters "Uh, I won't tell anybody.
