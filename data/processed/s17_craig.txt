17 1 Craig "...The truth about what?
"
17 1 Craig "...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
"
17 1 Craig "...Okay. 
"
17 1 Craig "Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
"
17 1 Craig "Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
"
17 1 Craig "I have no idea.
"
17 2 Craig "It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
"
17 2 Craig "I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
"
17 6 Craig "Where did you find a red-haired cow?
"
17 6 Craig "Wow, that's pretty trippy.
"
17 6 Craig "I gotta show this to my mom! 
"
17 6 Craig "Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
"
17 6 Craig "Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
"
17 7 Craig "Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
"
17 7 Craig "Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 
"
17 7 Craig "I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
"
17 7 Craig "Right. Let's all get PS4s.
"
17 7 Craig "That's exactly how XBox people are!
"
17 7 Craig "We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
"
17 7 Craig "Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
"
17 7 Craig "Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
"
17 7 Craig "They're still undecided.
"
17 7 Craig "We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
"
17 8 Craig "Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
"
17 9 Craig "At Red Robin?
"
17 9 Craig "So how do we take over Black Robin?
"
17 9 Craig "Haha.
"
17 9 Craig "Hey, that could work.
"
17 10 Craig "Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
"
17 10 Craig "Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.
"
17 10 Craig "Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend? 
"
17 1 Craig "...The truth about what?
