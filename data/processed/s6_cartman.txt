6 1 Cartman "Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Hello, is this City Wok?
"
6 1 Cartman "Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
"
6 1 Cartman "Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
"
6 1 Cartman "That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
"
6 1 Cartman "A- AIDS?
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
"
6 1 Cartman "Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
"
6 1 Cartman "That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
"
6 1 Cartman "Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
"
6 1 Cartman "Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
"
6 1 Cartman "I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
"
6 1 Cartman "That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
"
6 1 Cartman "He used to be fat but not no more 
"
6 1 Cartman "and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
"
6 1 Cartman "Uuuh, school project.
"
6 1 Cartman "Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
"
6 1 Cartman "So how long until we can joke about it?
"
6 1 Cartman "Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
"
6 1 Cartman "Then eat your puke.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
6 1 Cartman "Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
"
6 1 Cartman "The fat one!
"
6 1 Cartman "Just like Jared.
"
6 1 Cartman "Sir, we are in business!
"
6 1 Cartman "Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
"
6 1 Cartman "Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
"
6 1 Cartman "Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
"
6 1 Cartman "Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
"
6 1 Cartman "I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
"
6 1 Cartman "Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
"
6 1 Cartman "No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
"
6 1 Cartman "Check.
"
6 1 Cartman "That should blah  ah- here. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
"
6 1 Cartman "Alrighty.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright, I think it's in. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Bohogh, egh. 
"
6 1 Cartman "There it goes.
"
6 1 Cartman "Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, crap!
"
6 1 Cartman "Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
"
6 1 Cartman "Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
"
6 1 Cartman "Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
"
6 1 Cartman "Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Hello?
"
6 1 Cartman "Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
"
6 1 Cartman "Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
"
6 1 Cartman "There you are, Butters!
"
6 1 Cartman "No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
"
6 1 Cartman "No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
"
6 1 Cartman "Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Butters, it was my pleasure. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
"
6 2 Cartman "Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
"
6 2 Cartman "Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
"
6 2 Cartman "And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
"
6 2 Cartman "Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh
"
6 2 Cartman "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
"
6 2 Cartman "So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
"
6 2 Cartman "You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
"
6 2 Cartman "Shh-shh, here he comes.
"
6 2 Cartman "Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
"
6 2 Cartman "I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
"
6 2 Cartman "Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 
"
6 2 Cartman "His name is Thumper?
"
6 2 Cartman "Ugh, no more., 
"
6 2 Cartman "Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
"
6 3 Cartman "That's awesome, Kenny. 
"
6 3 Cartman "Aww, sick dude!
"
6 3 Cartman "Oh YES!! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
"
6 3 Cartman "Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
"
6 3 Cartman "Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
"
6 3 Cartman "Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah.
"
6 3 Cartman "Nice.
"
6 3 Cartman "They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 
"
6 3 Cartman "Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
"
6 3 Cartman "God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
"
6 3 Cartman "Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
"
6 3 Cartman "Testicles and scrotum! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Uh oh, we're losin' him.
"
6 3 Cartman "Oh, that was close.
"
6 3 Cartman "The present.
"
6 3 Cartman "Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?
"
6 3 Cartman "Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
"
6 3 Cartman "Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?

6 3 Cartman "What's the new topic?

6 3 Cartman "Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!

6 3 Cartman "Uh, sure!

6 3 Cartman "Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
"
6 3 Cartman "I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
"
6 3 Cartman "Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
"
6 3 Cartman "Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
"
6 3 Cartman "Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
"
6 3 Cartman "But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
"
6 3 Cartman "Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!

"
6 3 Cartman "Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Aaahh! 
"
6 4 Cartman "They look so delicious. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Memememee!
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
"
6 4 Cartman "Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
"
6 4 Cartman "Alriiight!
"
6 4 Cartman "No, Uncle Jesse, no!
"
6 4 Cartman "What? What the hell are you guys doing??
"
6 4 Cartman "Where are we going?
"
6 4 Cartman "What? Why?
"
6 4 Cartman "So?
"
6 4 Cartman "Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
"
6 4 Cartman "Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
"
6 4 Cartman "Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
"
6 4 Cartman "Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.
"
6 4 Cartman "No, it has to be Kyle. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh man, that was soho awesome!
"
6 4 Cartman "Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
"
6 4 Cartman "Heeeey! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
"
6 4 Cartman "You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
"
6 4 Cartman "Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
"
6 4 Cartman "O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
"
6 4 Cartman "See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
"
6 4 Cartman "I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
"
6 4 Cartman "Eh! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
"
6 4 Cartman "I want out.
"
6 4 Cartman "Yeah! Wait-what?
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit you guys.
"
6 4 Cartman "We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
"
6 4 Cartman "Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
"
6 4 Cartman "Can't go on. Need... food...
"
6 4 Cartman "There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Food!
"
6 4 Cartman "Look you guys! Beef jerky!
"
6 4 Cartman "Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
"
6 4 Cartman "Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
"
6 4 Cartman "Hippies!
"
6 4 Cartman "What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
"
6 4 Cartman "Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "Sure, sure.
"
6 4 Cartman "What do you have in mind?
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
"
6 4 Cartman "We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
"
6 4 Cartman "Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
"
6 4 Cartman "Hello.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
"
6 4 Cartman "We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Mike, speak.
"
6 4 Cartman "We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
"
6 4 Cartman "Good, good.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "And Worf?
"
6 4 Cartman "Step back! Tell those men to step back!
"
6 4 Cartman "Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain.""
"
6 4 Cartman "No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?""
"
6 4 Cartman "You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
"
6 4 Cartman """Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!""
"
6 4 Cartman "Okay, all set!
"
6 4 Cartman "Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
"
6 4 Cartman """Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""
"
6 4 Cartman "Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, it's a double-cross!!
"
6 4 Cartman "What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
"
6 4 Cartman "Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
"
6 4 Cartman "Thank God we stopped it in time.
"
6 5 Cartman "All right!
"
6 5 Cartman "Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
"
6 5 Cartman "I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
"
6 5 Cartman "Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Stan, okay. What's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Kyle. What's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
"
6 5 Cartman "Amen.
"
6 5 Cartman "What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
"
6 5 Cartman "Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
"
6 5 Cartman "Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Okay, how about ... that? 
"
6 5 Cartman "It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
"
6 5 Cartman "I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
"
6 5 Cartman "Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
"
6 5 Cartman "Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
"
6 5 Cartman "God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Argh!
"
6 5 Cartman "We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
"
6 5 Cartman "Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
"
6 5 Cartman "There, you got it, you got it!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, thank God.
"
6 5 Cartman "We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
"
6 5 Cartman "This TV is great, Chef.
"
6 5 Cartman "Aagh! God-dammit!
"
6 5 Cartman "This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
"
6 5 Cartman "Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
"
6 5 Cartman "Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
"
6 5 Cartman "Here we go!
"
6 5 Cartman "That's it? That's all the commercials?
"
6 5 Cartman "Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
"
6 5 Cartman "Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
"
6 5 Cartman "Eewww!
"
6 5 Cartman "God, I hate old people!
"
6 5 Cartman "And my house is being fumigated!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
"
6 5 Cartman "The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
"
6 5 Cartman "These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
"
6 5 Cartman "You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
"
6 5 Cartman "Woohoo!!! 
"
6 5 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
"
6 5 Cartman "You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
"
6 5 Cartman "Yeah, it sure does!
"
6 6 Cartman "I'll do it.
"
6 6 Cartman "Butters, could you take a seat, please?
"
6 6 Cartman "Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
"
6 6 Cartman "Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" 
"
6 6 Cartman "Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
"
6 6 Cartman "I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
"
6 6 Cartman "Lame, yes.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yes, well, we weren't.
"
6 6 Cartman "But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
"
6 6 Cartman "Who cares?
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
"
6 6 Cartman "Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
"
6 6 Cartman "I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
"
6 6 Cartman "...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
"
6 6 Cartman "We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
"
6 6 Cartman "Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Next?
"
6 6 Cartman "Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
"
6 6 Cartman "Alrighty then. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Uh, what's the question again?
"
6 6 Cartman "Five times one is of course...
"
6 6 Cartman "Five. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
"
6 6 Cartman "Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
"
6 6 Cartman "Just one more rose, Kyle.
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
"
6 6 Cartman "The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Next please.
"
6 6 Cartman "If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
"
6 6 Cartman "Very nice. 
"
6 6 Cartman "You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
"
6 6 Cartman "I think Towelie is awesome.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
"
6 6 Cartman "Token's a smartass.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yeah. Do we really need another one?
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh, thanks Jimmy
"
6 6 Cartman "Alright Jimmy, see ya. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
"
6 7 Cartman "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
"
6 7 Cartman "No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
"
6 7 Cartman "Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
"
6 7 Cartman "Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
"
6 7 Cartman "If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
"
6 7 Cartman "Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
"
6 7 Cartman "Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
"
6 7 Cartman "Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
"
6 7 Cartman "Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
"
6 7 Cartman "What the fuck is this?! 
"
6 7 Cartman "I got RIPPED OFF! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
"
6 7 Cartman "Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
"
6 7 Cartman "Heheh, okay, okay.
"
6 7 Cartman "Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
"
6 7 Cartman "Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
"
6 7 Cartman "Tweek! Where are you going?
"
6 7 Cartman "In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
"
6 7 Cartman "We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
"
6 7 Cartman "Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
"
6 7 Cartman "Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!
"
6 7 Cartman "Is it her?
"
6 7 Cartman "Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
"
6 7 Cartman "No, just a bunch of goo.
"
6 7 Cartman "There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
"
6 7 Cartman "It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
"
6 7 Cartman "Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
"
6 7 Cartman "G'night, guys.
"
6 7 Cartman "Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
"
6 7 Cartman "H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
"
6 7 Cartman "Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
"
6 7 Cartman "I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
"
6 7 Cartman "That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
"
6 7 Cartman "You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
"
6 7 Cartman "Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
"
6 7 Cartman "Do you have them or not?
"
6 7 Cartman "What's your name?
"
6 7 Cartman "Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
"
6 7 Cartman "I see, very interesting. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
"
6 7 Cartman "No, gallons.
"
6 7 Cartman "Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
"
6 7 Cartman "That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
"
6 7 Cartman "And I've got the sea men. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Nothin' to do now but wait.
"
6 7 Cartman "Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
"
6 7 Cartman "Ha ha! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
"
6 7 Cartman "Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
"
6 7 Cartman "I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
"
6 7 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
"
6 7 Cartman "...So?
"
6 7 Cartman "Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
"
6 7 Cartman "That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah! Go! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh God-damnit! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh no! Oh the humanity!
"
6 7 Cartman "Why can't societies just live in peace?
"
6 8 Cartman "I don't know.
"
6 8 Cartman "Ih... in our... butt?
"
6 8 Cartman "Maybe... No.
"
6 8 Cartman "Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
"
6 8 Cartman "Hm.
"
6 8 Cartman "Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
"
6 8 Cartman "It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
"
6 8 Cartman "Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
"
6 8 Cartman "What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
"
6 8 Cartman "Have you ever tried it?
"
6 8 Cartman "I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
"
6 8 Cartman "Okay, let's go, Jew! 
"
6 8 Cartman "Hold on!  God, let a man crap!
"
6 8 Cartman "I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
"
6 8 Cartman "I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
"
6 8 Cartman "Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
"
6 8 Cartman "Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
"
6 8 Cartman "Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
"
6 8 Cartman "It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
"
6 8 Cartman "You guys! You guys! Look! 
"
6 8 Cartman "I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
"
6 8 Cartman "So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
"
6 8 Cartman "Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
"
6 8 Cartman "Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
"
6 8 Cartman "That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
"
6 8 Cartman "You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
"
6 8 Cartman "So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
"
6 8 Cartman "O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
"
6 8 Cartman "Heh...  what?
"
6 8 Cartman "You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, we want our money back!
"
6 9 Cartman "You asshole! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
"
6 9 Cartman "Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
"
6 9 Cartman "Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
"
6 9 Cartman "Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
"
6 9 Cartman "Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
"
6 9 Cartman "Well we can just make them out of paper.
"
6 9 Cartman "It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
"
6 9 Cartman "Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
"
6 9 Cartman "How many hats have you made?
"
6 9 Cartman "We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
"
6 9 Cartman "Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
"
6 9 Cartman "I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
"
6 9 Cartman "But just remember that I do all the talking.
"
6 9 Cartman "Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
"
6 9 Cartman "Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
"
6 9 Cartman "What could possibly go wrong?
"
6 9 Cartman "...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, we're children.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
"
6 9 Cartman "Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
"
6 9 Cartman "Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
"
6 9 Cartman "He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
"
6 9 Cartman "Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
"
6 9 Cartman "People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
"
6 9 Cartman "Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
"
6 9 Cartman "Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
"
6 9 Cartman "Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
"
6 9 Cartman "You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
"
6 9 Cartman "Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
"
6 9 Cartman "...No, he has an icy heart.
"
6 9 Cartman "It's a cool island song.
"
6 9 Cartman "Oh, do we wanna do that?
"
6 9 Cartman "Wow.
"
6 9 Cartman "AY!
"
6 9 Cartman "Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
"
6 9 Cartman "That and youth. Those guys are old.
"
6 10 Cartman "Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
"
6 10 Cartman "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
6 10 Cartman "Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
"
6 10 Cartman "It puts the lotion back in the basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Yes Mom?
"
6 10 Cartman "...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
"
6 10 Cartman "Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
"
6 10 Cartman "But I wanna plaaayyy.
"
6 10 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
"
6 10 Cartman "Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
"
6 10 Cartman "It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
"
6 10 Cartman "Yeah, may be.
"
6 10 Cartman "Right, heh.
"
6 10 Cartman "Woohoo.
"
6 10 Cartman "God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"
6 10 Cartman "Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 
"
6 10 Cartman "Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
"
6 10 Cartman "Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
"
6 10 Cartman "And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
"
6 10 Cartman "And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
"
6 10 Cartman "Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
"
6 10 Cartman "And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
"
6 10 Cartman "And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
"
6 10 Cartman "Pleeeeease???
"
6 10 Cartman "Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
"
6 10 Cartman "Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
"
6 10 Cartman "That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
"
6 10 Cartman "And this is Precious.
"
6 10 Cartman "Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
"
6 10 Cartman "Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.""
"
6 10 Cartman "Heheh, yeah.
"
6 10 Cartman "Now say it again, louder.
"
6 10 Cartman "Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!""
"
6 10 Cartman "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""
"
6 10 Cartman "You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
"
6 10 Cartman "We're playing ""Lambs.""
"
6 10 Cartman "Bebe's boobs?
"
6 10 Cartman "So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
"
6 10 Cartman "What a stupid bitch! 
"
6 11 Cartman "One please.
"
6 11 Cartman "Dude, relax.
"
6 11 Cartman "Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
"
6 11 Cartman "So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
"
6 11 Cartman "At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
"
6 11 Cartman "Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
"
6 12 Cartman "You bet your fat clown ass it is!
"
6 12 Cartman "...ticket stub?
"
6 12 Cartman "Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?
"
6 12 Cartman "GODDAMMIT!!!
"
6 12 Cartman "You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
"
6 12 Cartman "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
"
6 12 Cartman "Kenny!!!
"
6 12 Cartman "Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
"
6 12 Cartman "What the fuck is closure?!
"
6 12 Cartman "You turned him into a teapot?
"
6 12 Cartman "Wewewewewewe...
"
6 12 Cartman "Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
"
6 12 Cartman "...Kenny?  Kenny?!
"
6 12 Cartman "What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
"
6 12 Cartman "God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
"
6 12 Cartman "Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
"
6 12 Cartman "Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 
"
6 12 Cartman "Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
"
6 12 Cartman "What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
"
6 12 Cartman "How?
"
6 12 Cartman "I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
"
6 12 Cartman "...No.  Ey! Euuugh.
"
6 12 Cartman "Wha-uh, what?? What?
"
6 12 Cartman "I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
"
6 12 Cartman "Do you think?
"
6 12 Cartman "Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
"
6 12 Cartman "Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
"
6 12 Cartman "Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
"
6 12 Cartman "You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
"
6 12 Cartman "Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
"
6 12 Cartman "Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
"
6 12 Cartman "AH! 
"
6 12 Cartman "In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
"
6 12 Cartman "What did you say?!
"
6 12 Cartman "What did you say?!
"
6 12 Cartman "I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
"
6 12 Cartman "I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
"
6 12 Cartman "You're a- stupid Jew.
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
"
6 12 Cartman "Shut up!
"
6 12 Cartman "Shut up!
"
6 12 Cartman "That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
"
6 12 Cartman "I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
"
6 12 Cartman "Looks like I've come to the right place.
"
6 12 Cartman "Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
"
6 12 Cartman "Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
"
6 12 Cartman "Eh! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny! kenny...
"
6 12 Cartman "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
"
6 12 Cartman "You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!"
6 12 Cartman "The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!
"
6 12 Cartman "You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
"
6 12 Cartman "I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
"
6 12 Cartman "I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Not by giving me brain damage!
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...
"
6 12 Cartman "...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.
"
6 12 Cartman "No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
"
6 12 Cartman "Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
"
6 13 Cartman "It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
"
6 13 Cartman "Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
"
6 13 Cartman "Jews can't be Paladins.
"
6 13 Cartman "Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
"
6 13 Cartman "Man, that's crap.
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
"
6 13 Cartman "Prepare for battle! 
"
6 13 Cartman "This sounds like a really important quest.
"
6 13 Cartman "This... is so cool.
"
6 13 Cartman "Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
"
6 13 Cartman "Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
"
6 13 Cartman "You're gay!
"
6 13 Cartman "Yeah!
"
6 13 Cartman "The one tape must be returned!  Run! 
"
6 13 Cartman "I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
"
6 13 Cartman "Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Cartman "Open.  Bellog. 
"
6 13 Cartman "We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
"
6 13 Cartman "Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Cartman "Clyde's a dick.
"
6 13 Cartman "Kevin, god-damnit..! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
"
6 13 Cartman "My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
"
6 13 Cartman "Quiet!
"
6 13 Cartman "You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
"
6 13 Cartman "Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
"
6 13 Cartman "A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
"
6 13 Cartman "Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
"
6 13 Cartman "Ha!! Fags! 
"
6 13 Cartman "It's Butters.
"
6 13 Cartman "Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
"
6 13 Cartman "Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
"
6 13 Cartman "There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
"
6 13 Cartman "I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
"
6 13 Cartman "Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
"
6 13 Cartman "We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
"
6 13 Cartman "If that was possible.
"
6 13 Cartman "We're screwed.
"
6 13 Cartman "The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
"
6 13 Cartman "And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
"
6 14 Cartman "Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
"
6 14 Cartman "No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
"
6 14 Cartman "Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 
"
6 14 Cartman "No, it was Kenny!
"
6 14 Cartman "Ey!
"
6 14 Cartman "Aw man, this is awesome! 
"
6 14 Cartman "I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
"
6 14 Cartman "Look, a covetous Jew!
"
6 14 Cartman "Ey!
"
6 14 Cartman "I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
"
6 14 Cartman "Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
"
6 14 Cartman "I'll take three lunches today, please.
"
6 14 Cartman "It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
"
6 14 Cartman "Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
"
6 14 Cartman "Nothing.
"
6 14 Cartman "Yes sir!  Phew. 
"
6 14 Cartman "Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 
"
6 15 Cartman "Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
"
6 15 Cartman "What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh, about a month.
"
6 15 Cartman "He's gone again.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.
"
6 15 Cartman "Kenny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Thanks, asshole.
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
"
6 15 Cartman "Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh, good. 
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Right now?
"
6 15 Cartman "Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ahh, Aahhhh! 
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
"
6 15 Cartman "God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
"
6 15 Cartman "It's still in baggage claims!
"
6 16 Cartman "Then you throw it away, smartass. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Who's this asshole?
"
6 16 Cartman "Then how does he know our names?
"
6 16 Cartman "Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
"
6 16 Cartman "That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
"
6 16 Cartman "Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 
"
6 16 Cartman "Yes, come in, please. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
"
6 16 Cartman "I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
"
6 16 Cartman "Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
"
6 16 Cartman "That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
"
6 16 Cartman "Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
"
6 16 Cartman "God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
"
6 16 Cartman "Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
"
6 16 Cartman "Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
"
6 16 Cartman "Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
"
6 16 Cartman "Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
"
6 16 Cartman "Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
"
6 16 Cartman "Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
"
6 16 Cartman "The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
"
6 16 Cartman "Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
"
6 16 Cartman "And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
"
6 16 Cartman "What?
"
6 16 Cartman "Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
"
6 16 Cartman "Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
"
6 16 Cartman "Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
"
6 16 Cartman "I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
"
6 16 Cartman "¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
"
6 16 Cartman "Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
"
6 16 Cartman "Marrado. Spectacularrr.
"
6 16 Cartman "God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
"
6 16 Cartman "Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
"
6 16 Cartman "Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
"
6 16 Cartman "Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
"
6 16 Cartman "Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
"
6 16 Cartman "Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
"
6 16 Cartman "Who the hell are you?
"
6 16 Cartman "Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
"
6 16 Cartman "Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
"
6 17 Cartman "You're done?
"
6 17 Cartman "Yeah, so how's it look?
"
6 17 Cartman "But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
"
6 17 Cartman "What?!
"
6 17 Cartman "Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
"
6 17 Cartman "It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
"
6 17 Cartman "God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
"
6 17 Cartman "Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
"
6 17 Cartman "Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
"
6 17 Cartman "Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
"
6 17 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
6 17 Cartman "Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
"
6 17 Cartman "You guys, that's it!
"
6 17 Cartman "Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
"
6 17 Cartman "...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
"
6 17 Cartman "They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
"
6 17 Cartman "The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
"
6 17 Cartman "Really?
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow!
"
6 17 Cartman "Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
"
6 17 Cartman "You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
"
6 17 Cartman "Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow, is that where Santa lives?
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, that's so lame of them. 
"
6 17 Cartman "Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
"
6 17 Cartman "That's what I thought.
"
6 17 Cartman "Hooray!
"
6 17 Cartman "No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
"
6 17 Cartman "Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
"
6 17 Cartman "Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
"
6 17 Cartman "It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, Christ.
"
6 17 Cartman "Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
"
6 17 Cartman "Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
"
6 17 Cartman "It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
"
6 17 Cartman "Jesus!
"
6 17 Cartman "This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
"
6 17 Cartman "This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
"
6 17 Cartman "Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
"
6 17 Cartman "Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit!
"
6 17 Cartman "Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Hello, is this City Wok?
"
6 1 Cartman "Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
"
6 1 Cartman "Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
"
6 1 Cartman "That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
"
6 1 Cartman "A- AIDS?
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
"
6 1 Cartman "Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
"
6 1 Cartman "That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
"
6 1 Cartman "Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
"
6 1 Cartman "Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
"
6 1 Cartman "I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
"
6 1 Cartman "That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
"
6 1 Cartman "He used to be fat but not no more 
"
6 1 Cartman "and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
"
6 1 Cartman "Uuuh, school project.
"
6 1 Cartman "Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
"
6 1 Cartman "So how long until we can joke about it?
"
6 1 Cartman "Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
"
6 1 Cartman "Then eat your puke.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
6 1 Cartman "Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
"
6 1 Cartman "The fat one!
"
6 1 Cartman "Just like Jared.
"
6 1 Cartman "Sir, we are in business!
"
6 1 Cartman "Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
"
6 1 Cartman "Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
"
6 1 Cartman "Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
"
6 1 Cartman "Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
"
6 1 Cartman "I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
"
6 1 Cartman "Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
"
6 1 Cartman "No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
"
6 1 Cartman "Check.
"
6 1 Cartman "That should blah  ah- here. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
"
6 1 Cartman "Alrighty.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright, I think it's in. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Bohogh, egh. 
"
6 1 Cartman "There it goes.
"
6 1 Cartman "Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, crap!
"
6 1 Cartman "Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
"
6 1 Cartman "Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
"
6 1 Cartman "Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?
"
6 1 Cartman "Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
"
6 1 Cartman "Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
"
6 1 Cartman "Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 
"
6 1 Cartman "Hello?
"
6 1 Cartman "Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
"
6 1 Cartman "Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
"
6 1 Cartman "There you are, Butters!
"
6 1 Cartman "No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
"
6 1 Cartman "No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
"
6 1 Cartman "Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
"
6 1 Cartman "Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Butters, it was my pleasure. 
"
6 1 Cartman "Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
"
6 2 Cartman "Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
"
6 2 Cartman "Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
"
6 2 Cartman "And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
"
6 2 Cartman "Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh
"
6 2 Cartman "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
"
6 2 Cartman "So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
"
6 2 Cartman "You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
"
6 2 Cartman "Shh-shh, here he comes.
"
6 2 Cartman "Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
"
6 2 Cartman "I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
"
6 2 Cartman "Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 
"
6 2 Cartman "His name is Thumper?
"
6 2 Cartman "Ugh, no more., 
"
6 2 Cartman "Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
"
6 3 Cartman "That's awesome, Kenny. 
"
6 3 Cartman "Aww, sick dude!
"
6 3 Cartman "Oh YES!! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
"
6 3 Cartman "Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
"
6 3 Cartman "Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
"
6 3 Cartman "Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah.
"
6 3 Cartman "Nice.
"
6 3 Cartman "They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
"
6 3 Cartman "Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 
"
6 3 Cartman "Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
"
6 3 Cartman "God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?

6 3 Cartman "Buh-ters! Buh-ters!

6 3 Cartman "Testicles and scrotum!

6 3 Cartman "Uh oh, we're losin' him.

6 3 Cartman "Oh, that was close.

6 3 Cartman "The present.

6 3 Cartman "Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?
"
6 3 Cartman "Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
"
6 3 Cartman "Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?

6 3 Cartman "What's the new topic?

6 3 Cartman "Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!

"
6 3 Cartman "I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
"
6 3 Cartman "Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
"
6 3 Cartman "Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
"
6 3 Cartman "Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
"
6 3 Cartman "But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
"
6 3 Cartman "Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!

6 3 Cartman "Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
"
6 3 Cartman "Aaahh! 
"
6 4 Cartman "They look so delicious. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Memememee!
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
"
6 4 Cartman "Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
"
6 4 Cartman "Alriiight!
"
6 4 Cartman "No, Uncle Jesse, no!
"
6 4 Cartman "What? What the hell are you guys doing??
"
6 4 Cartman "Where are we going?
"
6 4 Cartman "What? Why?
"
6 4 Cartman "So?
"
6 4 Cartman "Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
"
6 4 Cartman "Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
"
6 4 Cartman "Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
"
6 4 Cartman "Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.
"
6 4 Cartman "No, it has to be Kyle. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh man, that was soho awesome!
"
6 4 Cartman "Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
"
6 4 Cartman "Heeeey! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
"
6 4 Cartman "You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
"
6 4 Cartman "Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
"
6 4 Cartman "O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
"
6 4 Cartman "See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
"
6 4 Cartman "I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
"
6 4 Cartman "Eh! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
"
6 4 Cartman "I want out.
"
6 4 Cartman "Yeah! Wait-what?
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit you guys.
"
6 4 Cartman "We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
"
6 4 Cartman "Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
"
6 4 Cartman "Can't go on. Need... food...
"
6 4 Cartman "There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Food!
"
6 4 Cartman "Look you guys! Beef jerky!
"
6 4 Cartman "Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
"
6 4 Cartman "Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
"
6 4 Cartman "Hippies!
"
6 4 Cartman "What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
"
6 4 Cartman "Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "Sure, sure.
"
6 4 Cartman "What do you have in mind?
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
"
6 4 Cartman "We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
"
6 4 Cartman "Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
"
6 4 Cartman "Hello.
"
6 4 Cartman "All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
"
6 4 Cartman "We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Mike, speak.
"
6 4 Cartman "We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
"
6 4 Cartman "Good, good.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
"
6 4 Cartman "And Worf?
"
6 4 Cartman "Step back! Tell those men to step back!
"
6 4 Cartman "Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain.""
"
6 4 Cartman "No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?""
"
6 4 Cartman "You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
"
6 4 Cartman """Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!""
"
6 4 Cartman "Okay, all set!
"
6 4 Cartman "Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
"
6 4 Cartman "Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
"
6 4 Cartman """Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""
"
6 4 Cartman "Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
"
6 4 Cartman "Oh, it's a double-cross!!
"
6 4 Cartman "What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
"
6 4 Cartman "Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
"
6 4 Cartman "Thank God we stopped it in time.
"
6 5 Cartman "All right!
"
6 5 Cartman "Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
"
6 5 Cartman "I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
"
6 5 Cartman "Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Stan, okay. What's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Kyle. What's your name? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
"
6 5 Cartman "Amen.
"
6 5 Cartman "What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
"
6 5 Cartman "Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
"
6 5 Cartman "Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Okay, how about ... that? 
"
6 5 Cartman "It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
"
6 5 Cartman "I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
"
6 5 Cartman "Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
"
6 5 Cartman "Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
"
6 5 Cartman "God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 
"
6 5 Cartman "Argh!
"
6 5 Cartman "We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
"
6 5 Cartman "Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
"
6 5 Cartman "There, you got it, you got it!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, thank God.
"
6 5 Cartman "We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
"
6 5 Cartman "This TV is great, Chef.
"
6 5 Cartman "Aagh! God-dammit!
"
6 5 Cartman "This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
"
6 5 Cartman "Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
"
6 5 Cartman "Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
"
6 5 Cartman "Here we go!
"
6 5 Cartman "That's it? That's all the commercials?
"
6 5 Cartman "Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
"
6 5 Cartman "Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
"
6 5 Cartman "Eewww!
"
6 5 Cartman "God, I hate old people!
"
6 5 Cartman "And my house is being fumigated!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
"
6 5 Cartman "Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
"
6 5 Cartman "The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
"
6 5 Cartman "These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
"
6 5 Cartman "You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
"
6 5 Cartman "Woohoo!!! 
"
6 5 Cartman "Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
"
6 5 Cartman "You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
"
6 5 Cartman "Yeah, it sure does!
"
6 6 Cartman "I'll do it.
"
6 6 Cartman "Butters, could you take a seat, please?
"
6 6 Cartman "Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
"
6 6 Cartman "Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" 
"
6 6 Cartman "Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
"
6 6 Cartman "I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
"
6 6 Cartman "Lame, yes.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yes, well, we weren't.
"
6 6 Cartman "But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
"
6 6 Cartman "Who cares?
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
"
6 6 Cartman "Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
"
6 6 Cartman "I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
"
6 6 Cartman "...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
"
6 6 Cartman "We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
"
6 6 Cartman "Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Next?
"
6 6 Cartman "Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
"
6 6 Cartman "Alrighty then. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Uh, what's the question again?
"
6 6 Cartman "Five times one is of course...
"
6 6 Cartman "Five. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
"
6 6 Cartman "Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
"
6 6 Cartman "Just one more rose, Kyle.
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
"
6 6 Cartman "The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Next please.
"
6 6 Cartman "If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
"
6 6 Cartman "Very nice. 
"
6 6 Cartman "You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
"
6 6 Cartman "All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
"
6 6 Cartman "Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
"
6 6 Cartman "I think Towelie is awesome.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
"
6 6 Cartman "Token's a smartass.
"
6 6 Cartman "Yeah. Do we really need another one?
"
6 6 Cartman "Oh, thanks Jimmy
"
6 6 Cartman "Alright Jimmy, see ya. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
"
6 6 Cartman "Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
"
6 7 Cartman "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
"
6 7 Cartman "No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
"
6 7 Cartman "Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
"
6 7 Cartman "Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
"
6 7 Cartman "If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
"
6 7 Cartman "Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
"
6 7 Cartman "Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
"
6 7 Cartman "Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
"
6 7 Cartman "Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
"
6 7 Cartman "What the fuck is this?! 
"
6 7 Cartman "I got RIPPED OFF! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
"
6 7 Cartman "Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
"
6 7 Cartman "Heheh, okay, okay.
"
6 7 Cartman "Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
"
6 7 Cartman "Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
"
6 7 Cartman "Tweek! Where are you going?
"
6 7 Cartman "In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
"
6 7 Cartman "We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
"
6 7 Cartman "Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
"
6 7 Cartman "Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!
"
6 7 Cartman "Is it her?
"
6 7 Cartman "Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
"
6 7 Cartman "No, just a bunch of goo.
"
6 7 Cartman "There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
"
6 7 Cartman "It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
"
6 7 Cartman "Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
"
6 7 Cartman "G'night, guys.
"
6 7 Cartman "Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
"
6 7 Cartman "H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
"
6 7 Cartman "Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
"
6 7 Cartman "I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
"
6 7 Cartman "That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
"
6 7 Cartman "You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
"
6 7 Cartman "Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
"
6 7 Cartman "Do you have them or not?
"
6 7 Cartman "What's your name?
"
6 7 Cartman "Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
"
6 7 Cartman "I see, very interesting. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
"
6 7 Cartman "No, gallons.
"
6 7 Cartman "Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
"
6 7 Cartman "That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
"
6 7 Cartman "And I've got the sea men. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
"
6 7 Cartman "Nothin' to do now but wait.
"
6 7 Cartman "Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
"
6 7 Cartman "Ha ha! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
"
6 7 Cartman "Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
"
6 7 Cartman "I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
"
6 7 Cartman "What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
"
6 7 Cartman "...So?
"
6 7 Cartman "Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
"
6 7 Cartman "That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Yeah! Go! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh God-damnit! 
"
6 7 Cartman "Oh no! Oh the humanity!
"
6 7 Cartman "Why can't societies just live in peace?
"
6 8 Cartman "I don't know.
"
6 8 Cartman "Ih... in our... butt?
"
6 8 Cartman "Maybe... No.
"
6 8 Cartman "Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
"
6 8 Cartman "Hm.
"
6 8 Cartman "Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
"
6 8 Cartman "It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
"
6 8 Cartman "Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
"
6 8 Cartman "What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
"
6 8 Cartman "Have you ever tried it?
"
6 8 Cartman "I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
"
6 8 Cartman "Okay, let's go, Jew! 
"
6 8 Cartman "Hold on!  God, let a man crap!
"
6 8 Cartman "I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
"
6 8 Cartman "I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
"
6 8 Cartman "Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
"
6 8 Cartman "Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
"
6 8 Cartman "Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
"
6 8 Cartman "It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
"
6 8 Cartman "You guys! You guys! Look! 
"
6 8 Cartman "I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
"
6 8 Cartman "So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
"
6 8 Cartman "Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
"
6 8 Cartman "Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
"
6 8 Cartman "That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
"
6 8 Cartman "You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
"
6 8 Cartman "So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
"
6 8 Cartman "O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
"
6 8 Cartman "Heh...  what?
"
6 8 Cartman "You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, we want our money back!
"
6 9 Cartman "You asshole! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
"
6 9 Cartman "Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
"
6 9 Cartman "Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
"
6 9 Cartman "Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
"
6 9 Cartman "Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
"
6 9 Cartman "Well we can just make them out of paper.
"
6 9 Cartman "It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
"
6 9 Cartman "Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
"
6 9 Cartman "How many hats have you made?
"
6 9 Cartman "We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
"
6 9 Cartman "Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
"
6 9 Cartman "I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
"
6 9 Cartman "But just remember that I do all the talking.
"
6 9 Cartman "Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
"
6 9 Cartman "Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
"
6 9 Cartman "What could possibly go wrong?
"
6 9 Cartman "...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, we're children.
"
6 9 Cartman "Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
"
6 9 Cartman "Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
"
6 9 Cartman "Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
"
6 9 Cartman "He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
"
6 9 Cartman "Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
"
6 9 Cartman "People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
"
6 9 Cartman "Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
"
6 9 Cartman "Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
"
6 9 Cartman "Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
"
6 9 Cartman "Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
"
6 9 Cartman "You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
"
6 9 Cartman "Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
"
6 9 Cartman "...No, he has an icy heart.
"
6 9 Cartman "It's a cool island song.
"
6 9 Cartman "Oh, do we wanna do that?
"
6 9 Cartman "Wow.
"
6 9 Cartman "AY!
"
6 9 Cartman "Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
"
6 9 Cartman "That and youth. Those guys are old.
"
6 10 Cartman "Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
"
6 10 Cartman "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
6 10 Cartman "Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
"
6 10 Cartman "It puts the lotion back in the basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Yes Mom?
"
6 10 Cartman "...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
"
6 10 Cartman "Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
"
6 10 Cartman "But I wanna plaaayyy.
"
6 10 Cartman "Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
"
6 10 Cartman "Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
"
6 10 Cartman "It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
"
6 10 Cartman "Yeah, may be.
"
6 10 Cartman "Right, heh.
"
6 10 Cartman "Woohoo.
"
6 10 Cartman "God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"
6 10 Cartman "Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 
"
6 10 Cartman "Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
"
6 10 Cartman "Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
"
6 10 Cartman "And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
"
6 10 Cartman "And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
"
6 10 Cartman "Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
"
6 10 Cartman "And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
"
6 10 Cartman "And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
"
6 10 Cartman "Pleeeeease???
"
6 10 Cartman "Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
"
6 10 Cartman "Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
"
6 10 Cartman "That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
"
6 10 Cartman "And this is Precious.
"
6 10 Cartman "Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
"
6 10 Cartman "Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.""
"
6 10 Cartman "Heheh, yeah.
"
6 10 Cartman "Now say it again, louder.
"
6 10 Cartman "Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
"
6 10 Cartman "Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!""
"
6 10 Cartman "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""
"
6 10 Cartman "You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
"
6 10 Cartman "We're playing ""Lambs.""
"
6 10 Cartman "Bebe's boobs?
"
6 10 Cartman "So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
"
6 10 Cartman "What a stupid bitch! 
"
6 11 Cartman "One please.
"
6 11 Cartman "Dude, relax.
"
6 11 Cartman "Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
"
6 11 Cartman "So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
"
6 11 Cartman "At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
"
6 11 Cartman "Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
"
6 12 Cartman "You bet your fat clown ass it is!
"
6 12 Cartman "...ticket stub?
"
6 12 Cartman "Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?
"
6 12 Cartman "GODDAMMIT!!!
"
6 12 Cartman "You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
"
6 12 Cartman "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
"
6 12 Cartman "Kenny!!!
"
6 12 Cartman "Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
"
6 12 Cartman "What the fuck is closure?!
"
6 12 Cartman "You turned him into a teapot?
"
6 12 Cartman "Wewewewewewe...
"
6 12 Cartman "Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
"
6 12 Cartman "...Kenny?  Kenny?!
"
6 12 Cartman "What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
"
6 12 Cartman "God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
"
6 12 Cartman "Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
"
6 12 Cartman "Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 
"
6 12 Cartman "Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
"
6 12 Cartman "What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
"
6 12 Cartman "How?
"
6 12 Cartman "I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
"
6 12 Cartman "...No.  Ey! Euuugh.
"
6 12 Cartman "Wha-uh, what?? What?
"
6 12 Cartman "I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
"
6 12 Cartman "Do you think?
"
6 12 Cartman "Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
"
6 12 Cartman "Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
"
6 12 Cartman "Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
"
6 12 Cartman "You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
"
6 12 Cartman "Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
"
6 12 Cartman "Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
"
6 12 Cartman "AH! 
"
6 12 Cartman "In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
"
6 12 Cartman "What did you say?!
"
6 12 Cartman "What did you say?!
"
6 12 Cartman "I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
"
6 12 Cartman "I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
"
6 12 Cartman "You're a- stupid Jew.
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
"
6 12 Cartman "Shut up!
"
6 12 Cartman "Shut up!
"
6 12 Cartman "That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
"
6 12 Cartman "I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
"
6 12 Cartman "Looks like I've come to the right place.
"
6 12 Cartman "Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
"
6 12 Cartman "Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
"
6 12 Cartman "Eh! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Kenny! Kenny! kenny...
"
6 12 Cartman "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
"
6 12 Cartman "You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!"
6 12 Cartman "The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!
"
6 12 Cartman "You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
"
6 12 Cartman "I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
"
6 12 Cartman "I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 
"
6 12 Cartman "Not by giving me brain damage!
"
6 12 Cartman "Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...
"
6 12 Cartman "...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.
"
6 12 Cartman "No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
"
6 12 Cartman "Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
"
6 13 Cartman "It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
"
6 13 Cartman "Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
"
6 13 Cartman "Jews can't be Paladins.
"
6 13 Cartman "Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
"
6 13 Cartman "Man, that's crap.
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
"
6 13 Cartman "Prepare for battle! 
"
6 13 Cartman "This sounds like a really important quest.
"
6 13 Cartman "This... is so cool.
"
6 13 Cartman "Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
"
6 13 Cartman "And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
"
6 13 Cartman "Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
"
6 13 Cartman "You're gay!
"
6 13 Cartman "Yeah!
"
6 13 Cartman "The one tape must be returned!  Run! 
"
6 13 Cartman "I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
"
6 13 Cartman "Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Cartman "Open.  Bellog. 
"
6 13 Cartman "We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
"
6 13 Cartman "Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
"
6 13 Cartman "Clyde's a dick.
"
6 13 Cartman "Kevin, god-damnit..! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
"
6 13 Cartman "My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
"
6 13 Cartman "Quiet!
"
6 13 Cartman "You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
"
6 13 Cartman "Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
"
6 13 Cartman "A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
"
6 13 Cartman "Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
"
6 13 Cartman "Ha!! Fags! 
"
6 13 Cartman "It's Butters.
"
6 13 Cartman "Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
"
6 13 Cartman "Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
"
6 13 Cartman "There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
"
6 13 Cartman "Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
"
6 13 Cartman "I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
"
6 13 Cartman "Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
"
6 13 Cartman "We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
"
6 13 Cartman "If that was possible.
"
6 13 Cartman "We're screwed.
"
6 13 Cartman "The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
"
6 13 Cartman "And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
"
6 14 Cartman "Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
"
6 14 Cartman "No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
"
6 14 Cartman "Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 
"
6 14 Cartman "No, it was Kenny!
"
6 14 Cartman "Ey!
"
6 14 Cartman "Aw man, this is awesome! 
"
6 14 Cartman "I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
"
6 14 Cartman "Look, a covetous Jew!
"
6 14 Cartman "Ey!
"
6 14 Cartman "I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
"
6 14 Cartman "Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
"
6 14 Cartman "I'll take three lunches today, please.
"
6 14 Cartman "It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
"
6 14 Cartman "Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
"
6 14 Cartman "Nothing.
"
6 14 Cartman "Yes sir!  Phew. 
"
6 14 Cartman "Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 
"
6 15 Cartman "Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
"
6 15 Cartman "What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh, about a month.
"
6 15 Cartman "He's gone again.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.
"
6 15 Cartman "Kenny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Thanks, asshole.
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
"
6 15 Cartman "Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh, good. 
"
6 15 Cartman "Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!
"
6 15 Cartman "Right now?
"
6 15 Cartman "Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
"
6 15 Cartman "Ahh, Aahhhh! 
"
6 15 Cartman "Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
"
6 15 Cartman "God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
"
6 15 Cartman "It's still in baggage claims!
"
6 16 Cartman "Then you throw it away, smartass. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Who's this asshole?
"
6 16 Cartman "Then how does he know our names?
"
6 16 Cartman "Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
"
6 16 Cartman "That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
"
6 16 Cartman "Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 
"
6 16 Cartman "Yes, come in, please. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
"
6 16 Cartman "I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
"
6 16 Cartman "Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
"
6 16 Cartman "That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
"
6 16 Cartman "Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
"
6 16 Cartman "God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
"
6 16 Cartman "Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
"
6 16 Cartman "Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
"
6 16 Cartman "Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
"
6 16 Cartman "Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
"
6 16 Cartman "Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
"
6 16 Cartman "Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
"
6 16 Cartman "Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
"
6 16 Cartman "The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
"
6 16 Cartman "Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
"
6 16 Cartman "And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
"
6 16 Cartman "What?
"
6 16 Cartman "Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
"
6 16 Cartman "Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
"
6 16 Cartman "Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
"
6 16 Cartman "I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
"
6 16 Cartman "Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
"
6 16 Cartman "¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
"
6 16 Cartman "Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
"
6 16 Cartman "Marrado. Spectacularrr.
"
6 16 Cartman "God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
"
6 16 Cartman "Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
"
6 16 Cartman "Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
"
6 16 Cartman "Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
"
6 16 Cartman "Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
"
6 16 Cartman "Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
"
6 16 Cartman "Who the hell are you?
"
6 16 Cartman "Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
"
6 16 Cartman "Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
"
6 17 Cartman "You're done?
"
6 17 Cartman "Yeah, so how's it look?
"
6 17 Cartman "But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
"
6 17 Cartman "What?!
"
6 17 Cartman "Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
"
6 17 Cartman "It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
"
6 17 Cartman "God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
"
6 17 Cartman "Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
"
6 17 Cartman "Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
"
6 17 Cartman "Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
"
6 17 Cartman "Jesus Christ!
"
6 17 Cartman "Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
"
6 17 Cartman "You guys, that's it!
"
6 17 Cartman "Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
"
6 17 Cartman "...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
"
6 17 Cartman "They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
"
6 17 Cartman "The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
"
6 17 Cartman "Really?
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow!
"
6 17 Cartman "Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
"
6 17 Cartman "You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
"
6 17 Cartman "Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow, is that where Santa lives?
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, that's so lame of them. 
"
6 17 Cartman "Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
"
6 17 Cartman "That's what I thought.
"
6 17 Cartman "Hooray!
"
6 17 Cartman "No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
"
6 17 Cartman "Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
"
6 17 Cartman "Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
"
6 17 Cartman "It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, Christ.
"
6 17 Cartman "Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
"
6 17 Cartman "Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
"
6 17 Cartman "I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
"
6 17 Cartman "Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
"
6 17 Cartman "It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
"
6 17 Cartman "Jesus!
"
6 17 Cartman "This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
"
6 17 Cartman "This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
"
6 17 Cartman "Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
"
6 17 Cartman "Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
"
6 17 Cartman "Oh, God-damnit!
"
6 17 Cartman "Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
"
