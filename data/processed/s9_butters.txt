"
9 6 Butters "He says, he love you. 
"
9 6 Butters "He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
"
9 6 Butters "He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
"
9 6 Butters "Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
"
9 6 Butters "He can't! Don't you understand?!
"
9 6 Butters "God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!

9 6 Butters "Yeh you're still here.
"
9 6 Butters "Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
"
9 6 Butters "Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
"
9 6 Butters "Did you ever do anything really bad?
"
9 6 Butters "Broke fence...
"
9 6 Butters "Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
"
9 6 Butters "Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
"
9 6 Butters "Does this mean... you have to go now?
"
9 6 Butters "Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
"
9 6 Butters "Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 
"
9 6 Butters "Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
"

9 6 Butters "Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
"
9 6 Butters "Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
"
9 6 Butters "Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?
"
9 6 Butters "Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
"
9 6 Butters "Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
"
9 6 Butters "Really?
"
9 6 Butters "Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.

"
9 7 Butters "Well sure I do.
"
9 7 Butters "Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina.""  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
"
9 7 Butters "That's right, Jimmy.
"
9 7 Butters "Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo!

9 9 Butters "Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.

9 9 Butters "I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
"
9 9 Butters "Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
"
9 9 Butters "Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
"
9 9 Butters "How about we read each other's future?
