Jim
Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.
Mike
And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen.
Jim
[Camera switches to Nichole, who is stretching] That's right, Mike. All eyes are of course on fourth grader Nichole Daniels. Will she sit or stand for the National Anthem? [The crowd stare at her.]
Mike
This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem, [Two people are seen holding a banner reading 'WE SUPPORT YOU NICHOLE!'] the question on everyone's mind is "What is this little girl gonna do?"
Jimbo
She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?
Randy
Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!
Sports Commentator
Now please rise for the National Anthem. [they stand up.]
Randy
This is it.
Mike
The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh! [The camera moves to Heidi Turner, who is sitting down.] And Heidi Turner is sitting down!
Crowd
Ooh!
Jim
Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.
Mike
[Interrupting] And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave.
Dave
And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet.
Mike
Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole.
Randy
Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!
Jim
And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over.
Mike
The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us. [People start leaving]
Stephen
Oh my god, that was great. [The crowds empty out, leaving only a few left.]
Referee
Ah, play ball. [Blows whistle. The girls start playing.]
PC Principal's office. He's addressing the girls
PC Principal
Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality.
Heidi
What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!
PC Principal
Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42.
Wendy
It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!
PC Principal
Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him. [presses the intercom button] Send in Mr. Cartman.
Cartman
[opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
PC Principal
Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?
Cartman
It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not.
Heidi
He's lying. Make him show you his phone.
Cartman
Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
The U.S. Senate, day.
Joe Biden
Fellow Senators, our nation is divided like never before. While people everywhere fight for their voices to be heard, perhaps it is time for us to consider that our national anthem needs to be changed. Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone while still paying tribute to what it once was. I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this. [clicks on a handheld button and the picture behind him changes] J.J. Abrams.
Senators
[murmuring among themselves] J.J. Abrams!
Joe Biden
He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country.
Three helicopters take to the sky and fly out of sight
J.J. Abrams' mansion. The helicopters touch down by the front gates and the senators pour out
Lady Senator
[over a megaphone] Mr. Abrams? Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.
Male Senator
Look, there. [a light comes on at the left end of the second floor, and a shadow stops by the window]
Lady Senator
[over the megaphone] Mr. Abrams I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere. We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem. Please Mr. Abrams. We know you've been asked to reboot a lot.
Senator 2
[whispering] We know you're tired.
Lady Senator
We know you're tired.
Senator 3
[takes the megaphone] What do you say, sir? We all want something new and that makes us remember the things we lost. We want to 'member! We need your 'member berries! [Abrams mulls it over]
Male Senator
One light means yes, two lights means no. [Abrams reaches to his left and one light comes on. The gathered crowd goes wild.]
South Park Elementary gym, day. Cartman holds a school assembly
Cartman
Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait.
Wendy
I'm not funny.
Cartman
Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot..
Wendy
I don't feel like being funny right now.
Cartman
And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe.
Bebe
NO!
Cartman
No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say "vagina" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.
Bebe
Get the mic out of my face!
Cartman
[moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?
Nelly
Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck! [Butters got a great laugh out of that one]
Cartman
K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
Nelly
[stands up] You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys!
Cartman
K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
Nelly
Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!
Cartman
Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."
The Marsh living room. Randy is watching a news segment on CNN
News Anchor 1
And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love.
Randy
Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now. [There's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
Pollster
Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?
Randy
Oh. Oh-okay.
Pollster
Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?
Randy
Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich.
Pollster
Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?
Randy
That's right. [Sharon appears behind him and sees him talking to the Pollster] You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.
Pollster
Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls.
Randy
[shocked] What?
Marsh Dining Room
Randy
What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!
Sharon
Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it.
Randy
You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!
Stan
Hhhawgh!
Randy
What's wrong with you?
Stan
I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.
Randy
[snidely] Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America
Stan
Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?
Randy
[holds his palms out like fans] Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a nihilist.
Stan
It's nihilist.
Randy
See, you're such a nihilist.
News Report
News Anchor 2
Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.
Hillary Clinton (Turd Sandwich)
Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong.
Reporter 1
[after some clamor from the press corps] Mrs. Turd Sandwich?
Hillary
Yes, Arthur?
Arthur
Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?
Hillary
I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer.
The Garrison/Jenner headquarters. Mr. Garrison and Caitlyn are dancing around to "Cake By The Ocean"
Garrison
Yeah! Suck that poll you dumb bitch! Up 10%. Can you believe that shit?! [walks over to the table on which the radio sits] Oh, Caitlyn. I think we're really gonna win this thing! Think about it. [softly, awed] In a couple of months I will be President of the United States. [begins to worry and turns off the radio] Caitlyn, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, when we actually get into the White House, like um, what are we gonna do?
Caitlyn
What do you mean?
Garrison
Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?
Caitlyn
How the fuck should I know?
Garrison
[getting exasperated] Cait, you, you heard about the poll, right? We're probably gonna win. Don't tell me you don't have a plan.
Caitlyn
What plan? I thought you had a plan.
Garrison
I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!
Caityln
I thought you were gonna do that part.
Garrison
Are you tellin' me that we're about to be voted into office and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do?? [makes two fists] Ohhh Jeeez!
Mr. Mackey's Office, Kyle is talking to him
Kyle
I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?
Mr.Mackey
Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay.
Kyle
But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?
Mr.Mackey
Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?
Kyle
I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.
Mr.Mackey
You don't like mem- member berries?
Kyle
Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. [gets up and leaves the office. A few seconds later, Mr. Mackey opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a mason jar with member berries in it. He opens the jar and lifts the berries out]
Berries
Oh I 'member. 'Member Chewbacca? Yeah. And 'member AT-ATs? Member? Ey! Hey, 'member Ghostbusters? Ohh, I 'member. 'Member Slimer? Oh, I loved Slimer. 'Member? Ohh, I 'member. [they keep 'membering]
Mr.Mackey
How could someone think these things are bad? [plucks a berry and eats it]
Decision 2016, Commander In Chief Forum, from HBC News
Announcer
The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Moderator
Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche.
Garrison
Thanks, Matt.
Matt
Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President.
Garrison
Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?
Matt
In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally [reading his notes] fucking them all to death. How do you plan to actually achieve that?
Garrison
Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.
Matt
Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that.
Garrison
Oh, sure, okay. [they sit back as clips from previous statements are aired. First, from the time the fleeing Canadian kids were enrolled at South Park Elementary] Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's "fuck them all to death!" [At Niagara Falls] Fuck them all to death! Let's make this country great again!
Crowd
Fuck them all to death!
Garrison
[St. Louis] And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them-! [another rally] And you know those people in Syria, I'm gonna fuck them! [in Washington, D.C., all worked up] That's how we'll make sure that every terrorist on earth is fuckin' dead! [in a desert] The leaders of North Korea? I'll fuck them all, yeah! [Club Emotion] Yeah! Yeah! [another rally] The criminals in our jails?! Fuckin' dead a day after I- [another rally] Yeah! Those ads that are tryin' to kill us? I'll fuck anyone in the advertising business! And they'll all die too!
Matt
So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office.
Garrison
Uh huh, okay.
Matt
And, and, you think that's achievable?
Garrison
I do. I do, Matt. Uh, I mean, I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and, and look like a jackass. Huh, huhuh. [fearfully] Ohhh Jeeez.
South Park Elementary, preschool room. Class is in session
Teacher
Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric.
Cartman
[enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story?
Preschoolers
Yeah!
Cartman
This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called "Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Token." Get over it. "But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.]
The hallway, moments later. Kyle shuts the door behind him
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
Kyle
You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!
Cartman
Why would I do that, Kyle?
Kyle
I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! [takes Cartman's book and slams it down on the floor, then walks away angrily]
Skeeter's Wine Bar,night. Randy is at the bar with Jimbo and Stephen
Randy
What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!
Stephen
Randy, you gotta calm down.
Randy
[grabs onto Stephen] How can anyone be calm at a time like this?! [lets go] People actually think a turd is worse than a douche!
Stephen
Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?
Randy
Member berries?
Stephen
It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.
Stephen's master bedroom, night. He leads Randy in, opens the top drawer of his dresser, pulls out a box and sets it on top of the dresser, closes the drawer, and opens the box. The berries are chatting away.
Berries
'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Akira? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member...
Stephen
The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off.
Berries
'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?
Randy
Oh, they're adorable. [plucks one and eats it]
Garrison/Jenner headquarters. A team of advisers is listening to Garrison as he paces around the room
Garrison
Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!
Adviser 1
Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die.
Garrison
That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!
Adviser 2
Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?
Garrison
[walks to the table and takes a seat] Ugh! What the hell do I do? If I win I won't be able to do what I promised. But every day I keep going up in the polls. Why did the Democrats have to elect such a turd sandwich?
Caitlyn
Maybe you should just quit.
Garrison
If I quit, I look like a total jackass. [gets up and walks away, stopping by the "Pin The Tail On The Donkey" picture with Hillary's face on it.] If I win the election, I look like a total jackass. I have to keep running, [turns to face the picture] but I have to make sure she wins.
dramatic music plays out
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway, and Butters is laughing at something on his phone. Stan, Kyle, Jimmy, Craig, and Clyde stop and look at him
Butters
Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!
Craig
I wanna see.
Butters
[shows the other boys] Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! [Jimmy laughs and takes a closer look]
Kyle
Goddammit! [takes the phone from Butters] Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?!
Craig
We didn't do it.
Kyle
We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!
Cartman
[from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys]
Butters
Eric! What happened!
Cartman
A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message!
Clyde
That's a vagina?
Cartman
Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest] It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!
Kyle
[flatly] I didn't know vagina had balls.
Cartman
Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
Kyle
You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!
Cartman
What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
Kyle
It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! [walks away]
Garrison/Jenner headquarters. Garrison and Jenner now have a bank of phones, computers, and phone directories on the table and they're cold-calling people with them.
Garrison
Hello sir, how are you today? I'm calling from the Campaign for President, just seeing if uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today. Yes, I know she's a turd sandwich, but you know if ya, if you look past that, you know she, she really has a lot to offer. Well, I hear you, but sometimes in life you just gotta suck a turd, you know? Hello? [hangs the phone up up with anger] Dammit! This is impossible! Are you having' any success, Caitlyn?!
Caitlyn
I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election.
Garrison
Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!
CNN breaking news
Anchor 2
This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.
Garrison
Turn it up.
Anchor 2
The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.
Garrison
Ohhh Jeeez.
Anchor 2
Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.
Garrison
That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!
The Marsh living room. Randy is relaxing on the sofa with his bunch of member berries.
Berries
'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?
Randy
Ohh, I 'member.
Berry
Oh I loved Bionic Man [Randy plucks him and eats him.]
Berries
'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member.
Randy
Wai- what?
Berries
Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh.
Randy
[fondly] Yeeah, I remember that. [catches himself] Wait.
Berries
'Member feeling safe? 'Member no ISIS? 'Member Reagan? Ohh, I 'member. Ooo, 'member? Ooo, 'member? [Randy sits up and spits out what's left of the berries he's eaten]
Randy
What the fuck's going on with these member berries?
Kyle's bathroom. There's a knock on the door. Kyle is doing his business on the toilet
Kyle
Yeah?
Cartman
[opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute?
Kyle
What are you doing here??
Cartman
You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
Kyle
I'm going to the bathroom!
Cartman
Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
Kyle
[finishes up and hops off the toilet, pulling his pants up] They sat it out because you were harassing them online.
Cartman
Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
Kyle
Why would you care?!
Cartman
'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
Kyle
If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!
Cartman
Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad.
Kyle
Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt 42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!
Jim and Mike are back, this time commenting on the '49ers/Panthers game.
Mike
Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams.
Jim
And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.
Mike
This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here. [Hillary stands up and waves to the camera] There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her. [A shot of Garrison and Jenner in their own box, with Garrison waving happily to the crowd] And there's the Giant Douche doing the same.
Garrison
When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen-
Garrison
Here it is!
Jim
And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America.
Announcer
For our National Anthem we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise. [Garrison sits down] Or sit, or take a knee, in order to honor America. [Kaepernick, who has taken a knee, is as confused as anyone else]
Garrison
Wait a min- what, wait, what? Wait. [tries to strike a pose that isn't standing, sitting, or kneeling, but gets nothing.]
Jim
Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard. [Colin Kaepernick is also trying to figure out what to do]
Mike
More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
Jim
And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.
Garrison
No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!
Skank Hunt
At the school gymnasium, the parents of South Park Elementary students are watching a presentation by Dr. Schroeder about internet trolls.
Dr. Wayne Schroeder
Nobody is safe. Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards.
He changes the PowerPoint slide, showing a defaced picture of Heidi Turner's mother an example of internet trolling by Skankhunt42.
Dr. Schroeder
This troll is known only as Skankhunt42. [He cycles to the next slide.]
Dr. Schroeder
We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem.
The crowd gasps and talk among each other.
Dr. Schroeder
Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage. [The camera pans to Gerald smiling as Dr. Schroeder talks.]
Dr. Schroeder
But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.
He changes PowerPoint to a slide titled 'Signs That my Child is a Troll'.
Dr. Schroeder
In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: "Could my child be a troll?".
Sheila and Gerald's car, at night and after the PTA meeting.
Sheila
My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?
Gerald
Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. [Sheila gives Gerald a questioning look]
Gerald
Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it.
A bridge over a river, snowing. The same picture is reposted by Butters on Twitter, and Heidi looks at it on her phone sadly. Heidi then slowly walks to the side edge of the bridge. Surveying the drop, she types on her phone whilst tearing up. The camera pans up, a splash is heard, and two white birds fly past.
South Park Elementary, day. Police cars are parked outside the school. Kyle walks down the hallway past sad kids and police officers who are interviewing the teachers. He turns his head to see Bebe bawling and another girl comforting her who is also bawling. Kyle then meets Stan and Clyde.
Kyle
Dude, what's going on?
Clyde
You didn't hear?
Kyle
Hear what? What happened?
Stan
Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.
Kyle
Oh no. [Heidi walks past them, looking down.]
Stan
Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.
Kyle
She'll get back on.
Stan
No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.
At the South Park Elementary library, Mr. Mackey sits in front of a group of 4th graders to help them cope with their loss.
Mr. Mackey
Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay.
Bebe breaks down and starts crying; Red shifts over to comfort her.
Mr. Mackey
But this is what can happen when someone gets bullied online to the point they just can't go on anymore. [Kyle angrily looks over at Cartman.]
Mr. Mackey
I know that some of you are feeling anger, m'kay. [Annie, Wendy, and Nichole are angrily looking down] Some of you are feeling a little guilt, asking how something like this can happen. But the best thing we can do for Heidi, is come together as friends, and as students, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey
So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?
Everyone takes out their phones and an begins typing tweets on Twitter in memory of Heidi. Bebe continues weeping.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay.
At the South Park Elementary cafeteria, most girls are upset and the boys are eating at a table.
Stan
Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?
Cartman
Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.]
Stan
So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!
Cartman
You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously.
Broflovski residence, night. Ike is playing Minecraft on his computer. Gerald enters Ike's room
Gerald
Ike? Can I talk to you? [Takes a seat on Ike's bed] Come on, pull up a chair.
Ike stops playing and sits next to Gerald.
Gerald
You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!
Gerald
Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!
Gerald
Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night.
Gerald smiles at Ike before leaving. In the hallway, Sheila encounters Gerald
Gerald
Oh, hey!
Sheila
Did you talk to him?
Gerald
Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good.
Sheila
Oh, that's good.
Gerald
Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done.
Sheila
Oh, right, right, yeah.
Gerald
Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles.
Sheila
All right. Night Gerald.
Gerald
Night sweetie. [Gerald receives a kiss from Sheila]
In his office, Gerald turns on the lights and puts Smokin' by Boston on his turntable in the background. He pours some wine from a hidden compartment into a glass, sits at his desk, puts on his glasses, and starts surfing on Facebook. Text boxes pop up as background impressions voice over them.
Woman 1
Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.
Gerald
Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!
More surfing of Facebook
Woman 2
This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!
Gerald
Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!
Camera pans away from Gerald. A woman looks appalled after reading Gerald's post on her computer. Another woman is in shown also shocked. Gerald continues his trolling onslaught.
Commentator
You've been dick-slapped!
A couple are dining at a restaurant, but the woman becomes outraged after reading another of Gerald's posts on her phone. The man also becomes outraged after she shows it to him.
Gerald types on his 2 computers along to the notes of a keyboard. In a bathroom, a man on the toilet is startled after reading yet another of Gerald's post on his tablet. Explosions of various buildings start appearing. Gerald continues his relentless assault, also targeting Annie, who becomes enraged.
2 elephants are shown humping. A clip shows how Gerald photoshops dicks into women's mouths. Then at a Boston concert, Gerald reenacts playing the keyboard by typing on his computers. A traditional man spins 2 rods that are on fire.
Finally, Gerald yawns and calls it a night, taking his glass of wine and leaving the room. South Park Elementary, day. The girls are gathered at the playground, and Wendy paces back and forth
Bebe
You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!
Annie
This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!
Wendy
It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!
Girls (except Heidi Turner)
Yeah!
A backview shot of the boys is shown, with the girls in the background.
Annie
This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!
Girls (except Heidi Turner)
Yeah!
Clyde
[The boys are now the focus.] What do you think they're talking about?
Butters
They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!
Boy's Restroom, outside.
Butters
What are we gonna do about them?
Boy's Restroom, inside. The boys are gathered and Stan paces back and forth
Kyle
The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.
Craig
We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!
Butters
He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!
Clyde
Then let's end it.
Jimmy
What do you mean?
Clyde
Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.
The boys look at Clyde with surprise and dread. Stan stops pacing
Clyde
It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.
Kyle
Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it.
Stan
Clyde's right.
Kyle
Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-
Stan
What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
Token
He pushed everyone too far.
Butters
It's him, or us!
Kyle
Are we seriously talking about doing this?
Craig
How would we ever get away with it?
Stan
We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
In the school hallway, Cartman listens to some music while sitting. He notices the boys walking up to him
Cartman
'Sup dudes?
The boys are all looking down. Stan talks in an unenthusiastic tone.
Stan
After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter Strike all night with no one around to bother us.
Cartman
[Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?
Stan
Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.
Cartman
Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
Counsellor's office. Mr. Mackey sits at his desk holding a bunch of Member Berries.
Berries
'Member TIE fighters? Oh, 'member Jawas? 'Member? Hey, 'member Jurassic Park? Ooh, you love Jurassic Park. 'Member Jeff Goldblum? Oh, I 'member Jeff Goldblum - he was really tasty. [Mr. Mackey plucks one berry and eats it] I love Jeff Goldblum. 'Member?
Mr. Mackey
Mueeh...
Scott Malkinson barges into the counselor's office, startling Mr. Mackey who quickly puts away the Member Berries in his desk drawer.
Scott
I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!
Mr. Mackey
Oh! Er, hi Scott.[Scott sits on the chair in front of Mr. Mackey.]
Scott
Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!
Mr. Mackey
Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter.
Scott
Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!
Mr. Mackey
Who'd be happier?
Scott
Everyone.
Mr. Mackey
Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?
Scott
I don't think they'd even notice!
Mr. Mackey
Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now.
Scott
You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter.
Mr. Mackey
There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?
Scott
Okay, thanks.
Scott leaves the office. Mr. Mackey starts to retrieve the Member Berries, but Scott barges in again, forcing Mr. Mackey to return the Member Berries again.
Scott
Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!
Mr. Mackey
Okay, okay. Now, Scott-[Scott takes the seat again]
Scott
What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!
Mr. Mackey
O-kay...
In the woods the boys, who are still looking down and unenthusiastic, and Cartman, are trekking along a dirt path, bringing along their electronics.
Cartman
This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Token?
Token
Yeah, I'm really excited.
Cartman
I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
Clyde
I'm sure you will.
Cartman
You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
Stan
Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
Cartman
Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?
Kyle
We're almost there.
At sunset, they arrive at the cabin.
Cartman
This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
In the city, at a campaign-headquarters during the day, a supervisor is walking around.
Man
Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!
Supervisor
[Walks to the man.] What's wrong?
Man
Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!
The supervisor takes a closer look at the man's computer screen.
Man
He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!
Supervisor
Aww, don't let him get to you.
Man
Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!
Supervisor
Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.
At his house, during the day, Gerald leaves the house very cheerfully. Steal My Sunshine by Len starts playing as Gerald strides down the road. He cheerfully gets out of the way of a car after the driver honked. Passing by 2 neighbors arguing about the election ignorantly, he nearly gets knocked over by a biker, but blissfully passes it off.
At the supermarket, Gerald picks up a bottle of wine and happily skips to the checkout, passing by the Member Berries' section
Berries
'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?
Woman 3
[To the cashier.] I have a coupon for that too. An-and those are 6 for $4 with this coupon. [To Gerald] Sorry.
Gerald
Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!
On his way home that evening, Gerald slowly dances back to his house.
Outside his office at school, Mr. Mackey is locking up, but Scott Malkinson walks up behind him.
Scott
I'm gonna do it! [Mr. Mackey turns a worried, then frustrated look] I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time!
Mr. Mackey
Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?
Scott
They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!
Mr. Mackey
Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm...
He unlocks the office door, then goes inside with Scott.
In the woods, at night, the boys finally reach the cabin.
Cartman
Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.
Inside the cabin, Cartman eagerly goes over to the table at the far end and puts his items on it, while the boys form behind him.
Cartman
Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
Kyle closes the cabin door. Everybody takes out a weapon, except for Cartman.
Cartman
I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices]
Cartman
You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...
Clyde
The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.
Cartman
What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
Stan
You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.
Cartman
Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
Kyle
Just put your stuff on the table and step back.
Cartman
Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
Token
Let's just get it over with!
Cartman
No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
Clyde
I can't listen to this!
Cartman
Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
Craig
Let's just get it over with! [Walks up to Cartman]
Cartman
No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling.
Craig stabs Cartman's laptop with his knife. The rest of the boys start advancing forward.
Cartman
No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
Cartman's electronics are knocked onto the table, and subsequently destroyed by the boys
Cartman
Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
Cartman passes out. Outside the cabin after some time, the hole is filled up, and Token pats the soil with the shovel. The boys look horrified.
Stan
What have we done?
Kyle
What we had to do.
Cartman
[Off screen.] Iaahh!!
In his bedroom, with the lights off, Mr. Mackey is sleeping when his phone starts ringing. Mr. Mackey jolts up from the ringing, puts his glasses on and sees the caller is Scott Malkinson.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, Goddammit. You've got to be kidding me. [Sighs, then answers phone.] This is Counselor Mackey. What's going on Scott?
Scott is on his phone while off his bed, grabbing onto a pillow.
Scott
I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.
Mr. Mackey
Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter.
Scott
Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!
Mr. Mackey
That's not true, no one would be happier. [Brings the phone away from his face.]
Mr. Mackey
This fucking kid, oh my god... [Brings the phone back to his ear.] Everybody thinks you're a great kid, Scott.
Scott
I-I talked to my dad. He said, "I don't have the guts to do it!". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!
Mr. Mackey
Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?
Scott
I don't know if I'll make it through the night!
Mr. Mackey
[off phone] Oh, for fuck's sake...
Scott
I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!
Mr. Mackey
[on phone] Uh-huh, okay, go on with that.
Scott
I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.
Mr. Mackey
[off phone] Goddammit, just do it already...
At home, at night, Gerald is again trolling online with Smokin' by Boston playing. However, just before leaving, his computer screen lights up with a Google alert, notifying Gerald that he was mentioned on CNN. Gerald clicks on the video link.
CNN Reporter
Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer.
Gerald
I made the news...
CNN Reporter
The troll, who goes by the name "SkankHunt42", ...
Gerald
[He claps his hands.] Yes!
CNN Reporter
...caused the website to temporarily shutdown. Danish Olympic Gold Medalist Freja Ollegard, who started the website, spoke out about the incident. [The inset video of Freja Ollegard zooms in.]
Freja Ollegard
I am not shocked. I am not sad. I am not giving this pitiful person the satisfaction of being anything. [Gerald listens intently].
Freja Ollegard
This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.
Gerald
Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.
Gerald starts furiously typing on his computer, and a shadow appears on his wall by the computer screen's illumination. The camera pans to the shadow.
At South Park Elementary the next day, Kyle walks through the hallway again, but this time the girls are angrily slamming their lockers before walking away. He meets Stan and Clyde again.
Kyle
What's going on?
Stan
You didn't hear?
Kyle
Hear what?
Stan
The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!
Kyle
No, that's impossible!
Stan
It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done.
Kyle
Oh my God. Oh my God...
Inside Bebe's room, the girls are gathered. Wendy looks unsure.
Nelly
The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!
Wendy
Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.
Nichole
We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing.
Annie
Don't forget what you said Wendy: "For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!". Now they'll have to listen.
At South Park Elementary, the following day, Gortoz a Ran by Denez Prigant plays in the background. Annie hides behind some hallway lockers till her boyfriend passes by. She catches up and gives a note to him, then leaves. The note reads: "I'm breaking up with you forever. Annie.". The boy falls to his knees, drops the note and yells as tears stream down his cheeks, 'No!' in slow motion.
Kevin receives a note too from Red, as well as all the boys with girlfriends. Girls run down the hallway holding notes like a deadly mob. The library. Clyde, clutching his hair, cries alone at a table with a note in front of him, tears streaming down his face.
Kindergarten couples also break up too, as a girl gives a boy a note that reads: "I brake up.". This results in the boy face planting into his toy blocks construction. Token also receives a note from Nichole at the basketball court that reads: "I break up. Goodbye. Don't call. Nichole". Token falls to his knees, broken.
In the Boy's Restroom, 2 boys who received notes resort to hugging each other for comfort. Playground. Kyle is sitting alone on the swings with his class picture in hand, and his eye starts tearing up when he sees Cartman fade from the picture.
In the hallway, any boys are crying in corners, notes strewn and crumpled. Stan walks down the hallway, glancing at the boys before encountering Wendy. Wendy regrettably holds out the note in her hand. Stan hesitantly takes the note, and reads: "This is goodbye forever, Stan. I can't fix you. Wendy". When Stan looks up, Wendy is gone from view
The Damned
[Simply Heidi. Her guest is Freja Ollegard]
Simply Heidi
We are back again with the brave Olympic gold medalist from Denmark, Freja Øllengård. Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences.
Freja Ollegard
Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people.
Simply Heidi
You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called [puts on her glasses] skankhunt42.
Gerald
[watching on his computer, holding a glass of wine] Nice.
Freja Ollegard
I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more.
Simply Heidi
It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.
Freja Ollegard
Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. [cheers from teh studio audience.]
Simply Heidi
I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: "You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you." And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo [Freja is alarmed at the name], in Spain.
Gerald
[exults at his coup] He shoots, he scores! [Freya knows she's been trolled again and puts her face in her palm]
Simply Heidi
And there's this one: "Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration." That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.
Audience Member
Oh no...
Gerald
HA! [throws an air ball] From the 3-point line!
Simply Heidi
I'm sorry, am I missing something?
[The Broflovski house, day. Police cars are in front and a couple of officers are at the door. Officer Barkley rings the bell]
Gerald
Oh! Police! [sheepishly] Yes?
Officer
Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation.
Gerald
Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?
Barkley
Do you happen to know this child? [shows him Cartman's picture from Photo Day]
Gerald
[relieved] Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends.
Barkley
Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter.
Gerald
Hooo... another one, huh?
Barkley
Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it.
Gerald
Kyle! [looks up the stairs]
Barkley
We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
Gerald
Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?
Kyle
[panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit.
Barkley
D'ya happen to know why, son?
Kyle
He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know.
Barkley
Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media.
Gerald
Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?
Barkley
At where, sir? at where?
[Kyle's room, moments later. Kyle runs in and closes the door frantically, then whips out his phone to talk to some people]
Kyle
Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!
Clyde
The cops? For what?
Token
You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! [he's video-chatting with the other boys on his computer, in several windows]
Craig
We did what we had to do.
Kyle
But we were wrong!
Butters
[under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us
Jimmy
Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?
Butters
It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.
[Stan's room. He's not part of the conversation. He sits on his bed looking at selfies of Wendy on his phone. Wendy on her bed reading a book and smiling at the camera. Another selfie of her in the sun. A selfie of her sitting at a counter. A selfie of her at a beach making a victory sign with her right index and middle fingers. A picture of Cartman licking the ass of a life-sized picture of him. That picture has him looking at a phone which has a picture of him looking at a phone...]
Randy
Stan? [Stan's door is open, so Randy walks in] You can't just stay in your room all day.
Stan
What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks.
Randy
[rubs the back of his neck] Yeah, everything sucks. [lowers his hand] Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN.
Sharon
[off screen] Go to hell, Randy!
Randy
I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.
[Clinton campaign headquarters. She and her staff prepare for the debate]
Aide 1
Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says.
Aide 2
Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Bon't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with "My opponennt is a liar, and he cannot be trusted."
Clinton
Got it.
[The Presidential Debate]
Announcer
Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt.
Lester Holt
Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?
Garrison
Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far, [Holt looks confused] but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay? [Clinton's aides watch from a back room] I will fuck this country up beyond repair. [Clinton's aides smile at this admission] I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.
Clinton
...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.
Aide 1
NOOO!
Aide 2
Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich.
Clinton
What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.
Garrison
[throws his hands up and then faces Clinton] I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?! [faces the audience again] Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first.
Clinton
My opponent is a liar-
Garrison
Would you just please shut up?
Clinton
-And he cannot be-
Garrison
Get out of your own way.
Clinton
-cannot be trusted.
Garrison
[in exasperation] Okay, okay, look. [stands up again] She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-
Clinton
My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. [as she says this, he throws his hands up and turns his back to the camera]
Garrison
Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked.
[South Park Elementary, day. Four of the seven boys who destroyed Cartman's electronics are in PC Principal's office.]
PC Principal
Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games. [before him are Kyle, Stan, Butters, and Token] The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media. [Butters fidgets a bit] Nobody's get anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bogoted, racist troll! [sweeps his hand across his desk and knocks a stack of papers to the floor]
Butters
[lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh!
PC Principal
We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world.
[The school hallways, later. Cartman walks down the hallway dejected. The kids around him are looking at their phones or talking on them as they go about their usual business. Cartman sees Kevin on his phone and sighs, then continues walking.]
Voice
[gruff whisper] Eric. [he looks up. By some exit doors is Heidi]
Cartman
Heidi? Heidi Turner?
Heidi
Come with me.
Cartman
Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
[The neighborhood streets. Heidi walks, then stops and waits for Cartman]
Heidi
Join us. [points to a park] here.
Cartman
The park?
Heidi
I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact.
Cartman
[begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
Heidi
Come on. There are others like us here. [guides him into the park. A car appears and slows down]
Driver
Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?
Martha
What are they?
Driver
Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.
Martha
They seem so lonely. [they both look at their phones]
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, night. The doors open and Randy rushes in]
Randy
Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!
Stephen
Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?
Randy
You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!
Stephen
More than ever.
Ryan Valmer
Yyyup.
Randy
Did you see the same debate I saw?!
Stephen
Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.
[Douche 2016 campaign rally at Pepsi Center. Garrison is speaking]
Garrison
America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here. [the crowd cheers his honesty, which stuns him] Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period.
Man
Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician.
Garrison
I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay? [more cheers go up] No! Shut up! Listen to me! [the crowd quiets down] You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!
Random Person
Wooohooo!
Garrison
I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!
Man 2
He's so honest!
Garrison
No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick. [more cheering. He turns away from the mic] OHHHH JEEEZ
[Ike's room, day. Gerald peeks in and sees him at the computer.]
Gerald
Ike, got a minute? [enters and sits on Ike's bed] Let's talk, buddy. [Ike pauses his game and goes to his bed] You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. [steps outside, then leans back and smiles at Ike, then leaves and closes the door]
[The park, day. Heidi and Cartman are sitting on a bench while a duck stands on the ground before them.]
Heidi
I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.
Cartman
For what?
Heidi
When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.
Cartman
You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
Heidi
So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?
Cartman
[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
Heidi
Do you miss your friends?
Cartman
I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
Heidi
You do now. [smiles at him]
Cartman
Kewl.
[Douche 2016 campaign rally at Pepsi Center. Garrison is speaking]
Newt Gingrich
Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! [makes way for Mr. Garrison]
Garrison
I hate all of you so much.
Random Person
Yeah!
Garrison
I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit. [cheers] If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. [more cheers]
Randy
[watching on TV] I agree.
Garrison
I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.
Randy
Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy.
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, day.]
CNN Anchor
And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with "My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted."
Patron
I am so confused.
CNN Anchor
In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja Øllengård is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. [Gerald walks into the bar and watches the report]
Gerald
Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?
CNN Anchor
The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42. [Gerald smiles and looks around to see if anyone has figured out it was him who's the troll] Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja Øllengård finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. [Gerald's smile vanishes.]
Field Reporter
Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja Øllengård has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen. [there's fear in Gerald's face] The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. [footage is shown of her doing this, with a klieg light focused on her all the way down. She lands on a car and shatters, blood going all over the place. The car's alarm turns on]
Paul
Freja Øllengård, dead at the age of 38. [Quickly, Gerald runs to the restroom and into a stall. A patron watches him enter and continues doing so until the scene ends]
Gerald
[on the toilet seat] Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!
[The Stotch house. Someone knocks on the door and Stephen goes to answer it.]
Randy
I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy.
Stephen
[surprised] What?
Randy
It's just... [walks in] I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote.
Stephen
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Randy
[turns around] What?
Stephen
You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!
Randy
You were just voting for him yesterday!
Stephen
Yeah, but not anymore!
Randy
What happened??
Stephen
I don't know.
Randy
What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!
Stephen
You just did.
Randy
[processes that reply] ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?
Stephen
I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.
Randy
But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.
Stephen
I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie.
Randy
[thinks a moment] Member berry pie... [drops the thought] Okay, I love member berries. [follows Stephen to the dining room table]
[At the table. Randy has served himself a slice of member berry pie.]
Berries
'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor.
Randy
[picks some berries up with a spoon, but stops] Wait a minute... [a camera pans away from the Stotch house into space, then moves east to Europe, then zooms in on Denmark.]
[Copenhagen, Denmark, at Rosenborg Park. Someone speaks over loudspeakers at Freja Øllengård's funeral outside the cathedral.]
Troll Hunter
[in a Danish accent] Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families. [Freja's casket is slowly brought to the altar outside the cathedral] A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run. [a mourner sobs] No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.
[Community park in South Park, day. Heidi sits on the bench alone, waiting. Cartman walks up and sits next to her]
Heidi
Hey.
Cartman
Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
Heidi
Why is that?
Cartman
Because, black laughs matter.
Heidi
...Is that a joke?
Cartman
Yes, it is.
Heidi
I don't get it.
Cartman
Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
Heidi
The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.
Cartman
You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
[Hillvale Farm, day. Organic fruits and vegetable. Pick your own! YES! We Have Member Berries! Randy drives in and reaches the farm house, then steps out of the car.]
Jud
Mornin'. How can I help ya?
Randy
Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?
Jud
Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days. [turns left and walks off] Right over heah. [Randy joins him] Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. [the voices of member berries get louder as they approach the berry grove. There are berries as far as the eye can see.]
Randy
Oh my God, there's this many?
Berries
'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?
[The supermarket, which is not a Whole Foods Market, day. Gerald walks out with his groceries looking at his phone. He approaches his car, which has a note under a windshield wiper. Gerald notices is, takes it from the wiper, and reads it. "Gerald Broflovski." He opens it, and reads the message inside, written in red marker: "I know who you are." Panicked, Gerald looks around and gets paranoid. He gets into his car quickly.]
Gerald
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. [reaches into his glove compartment and pulls out a hammer called "Protocol Zero." He leaves the car with phone and hammer in tow. An elderly woman draw near as he smashes the phone to bits on the roof of his car. Once he's destroyed the phone, he gets into his car and peels out. He rushes home and runs up to his office. He turns on his computer and begins to delete stuff in the Gerald folder he has on there. After that he opens up the computer and pulls out the hard drive. He takes the computer apart, puts it all in a duffel bag and drives to Stark's Pond, where he sets up a portable foot-operated catapult and launches the duffel bag into the pond. He quickly rushes home again and sites next to Sheila on the couch. Sheila just glances at him]
Shelia
I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.
Gerald
[rushed] Our computer's broke.
Shelia
...What?
Gerald
It broke and I had to throw it away.
Shelia
I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed.
Gerald
No now you just throw it away.
Shelia
You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.
Gerald
I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! [runs upstairs]
[Ike's room, moments later. Gerald runs in and towards the computer]
Gerald
Move move move! [pushes Ike out of the way and gets to work] My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail. [It's from unknown] That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything? [he reads the e-mail. It says the same thing the note did] "I know who you are." [spins around and points at Ike] You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?
Ike
No, but I want to, Dad.
Gerald
[thinks of the Biblical sense] Not like that, smartass! [turns back to the computer and works on his account] Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails! [gets an e-mail: "You have a Google alert!" He clicks OK and reads] "meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow." [panics] Oh God...
[M burgers, day. Cartman and Heidi are eating lunch there.]
Heidi
You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?
Cartman
Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
Heidi
[tries it and eats] Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad.
Cartman
Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
Heidi
Yeah, of course.
Cartman
Do girls... not have balls?
Heidi
Girls do not have balls, no
Cartman
So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
Heidi
[munches on a fry] Do you want me to show you?
Cartman
...Holy shiiit.
Wieners Out
The camera runs through the mountains.
Narrator
Long ago, in the deep and frozen lands of Scandinavia, there were creatures who wreaked havoc on humanity. [A troll is seen] The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea. [Earth is seen as it rotates. It zooms in on America, and an internet troll is seen] Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected, [Different trolls are seen] free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again.
The Broflovski living room. Gerald looks at the note, reading 'I know who you are'. Kyle comes up.
Kyle
Dad, can I talk to you?
Gerald
Sure, Kyle.
Kyle
All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us.
Gerald
Uh huh.
Kyle
Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward.
Gerald
Good.
Kyle
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?
Gerald
Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother. [gets off the couch] I love you! [walks away]
Butters' bedroom. Butters Skypes with Charlotte while she is in her room.
Butters
It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.
Charlotte
Butters,I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?
Butters
[becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me!
Charlotte
I have to stand with my girlfriends.
Butters
Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass!
Charlotte
Who?!
Butters
Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!
Charlotte
This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
Butters
So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you!
Charlotte
[ends the call]
Butters
Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey?
Gerald walks under the Freemont Bridge incognito and meets with Dick. Dick blows a puff of smoke at him.
Gerald
[takes off his sunglasses] I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.
Dick
My name is Dick.
Gerald
Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?
Dick
No! I'm a colleague.
Gerald
A colleague?
Dick
You probably know me as "Dildo Shwaggins".
Gerald
Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!
Dick
We need to talk.
Gerald
You're just a troll?! [turns to his left, raises his arms, and looks up] Oh thank god!
Dick
We're on the same team, Skankhunt.
Gerald
[lowers his hand] Wait, but that means I went "Protocol Zero" for nothing. Oh shit [throws his cup of coffee]!
Dick
What's "Protocol Zero"?
Gerald
[circles around and then sits] Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone! [looks at Dick] Why couldn't you just say, "I know who you are. I'm a troll too,"? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!
Dick
Us trolls have to be careful. You know that.
Gerald
Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded. I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!
Dick
These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together.
Gerald
For what?
Dick
Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.
Gerald
It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.
Dick
That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.
Gerald
[stands up] No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out, [grabs his sunglasses] but that was too spooky. [puts on his sunglasses and walks away].
Dick
Gerald, we need each other. The Danish [raises his arms] are planning something horrible against us.
Gerald
[stops and faces Dick] I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. [tries to climb up the steep dirt, but falls down].
South Park Elementary School Playground. A group of boys come together and form a semi-circle around Kyle.
Kyle
[talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support.
Stan
You really think that's gonna make a difference?
Kyle
I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing]
Butters
Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!
Kyle
Butters?
Butters
[turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners!
Kyle
Butters, you need to calm down.
Butters
No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?
Clyde
Nowhere.
Butters
[turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!
Token
That's true!
Butters
I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle.
The Broflovski living room. Gerald taps his fingers with boredom on the dinner table. Sheila then checks on her husband.
Sheila
Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?
Gerald
[stops tapping] I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just be? Is that illegal now?
Sheila
Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry.
Gerald
I'm totally happy. I'm happy. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.
Sheila
Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something. [takes out iPad from a bag] Here, it's your own iPad.
Gerald
[gets frightened, stands up and tries walking away from Sheila] Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me.
Sheila
[turns to her husband] You don't like it?
Gerald
No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit. [leans closer to the iPad and speaks softer in a harsh tone] Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards. [backs away and speaks normally] No, I'm good! I don't need it!
Sheila
Gerald, [walks closer to Gerald] what's going on?
Gerald
Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine. [turns so his body faces the table] I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.
Sheila
Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch. [walks to the kitchen] Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?
Gerald
[faces the front window] What guy outside? [walks towards the window and sees Dick on the other side of the road from his house] What the fuck? [checks on Sheila and then whispers to Dick] Go away, go! [waves his arms sideways] Go! Go away! Go go!
Dick
[shows a note to Gerald that says "WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK", then drops the paper to show the other note saying "IT'S IMPORTANT"]
Gerald
[whispers quickly, closes the blind and curtains of the window, and then walks away]
South Park Elementary gymnasium. A large crowd of people watch the girls volleyball game.
Sports Commentator
Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.
Kyle
Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!
Stan
Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!
Wendy
[smiles at Stan]
Kyle
This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.
Referee
[blows whistle]
Sports Commentator
And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem.
National Anthem plays
Butters
[takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked]
Jason
Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters.
other boys gradually start to follow Butters' actions except for adults, Kyle, and Stan
Kyle
Oh [hits his face] no!
South Park.
Gerald
[walks through town depressed and then quickly dodges a bicyclist] Son a bitch! Ahhh! [walks near the Community Center, reads a sign about addiction problems, and checks the group]
South Park Community Center. A group of guys are in a social group hosted by Randy.
Randy
Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard.
Gerald
[sits on the available chair to the right of Randy]
Richard
Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now.
Randy
It's okay, man. You're not alone.
Richard
It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense.
Randy
And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.
Gerald
What is this?!
Randy
What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?
Gerald
I, I don't even know what a member--.
Berries
[muffled from Michael's pocket] 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!
Randy
[coughs] Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?
Berries
Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!
Michael
[sqishes the memberberries] Nope!
Randy
Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?
Gerald
I don't even know what memberberries are.
Stephen
Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.
Gerald
Yeah. [stands up and points at Stephen] Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself! [calms down] Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. [walks away]
South Park Elementary: Principal's Office. PC Principal talks with Wendy, Bebe, Annie Knitts, and Nichole.
PC Principal
Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.
Wendy
They took their wieners out!
PC Principal
[points upwards] Correct! [lowers his arms] But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.
Wendy
This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!
PC Principal
I want you to understand something, ladies. [positions his hands parallel from each other] I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say [moves his hands to his right] they can't protest even though [moves his hands to the left of him] you protested [moves his hand back towards the middle] and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!
Bebe
So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?
PC Principal
That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
South Park Elementary: hallways. Stan and Kyle put their stuff in their lockers. While hearing Butters, they face him in shock.
Butters
[speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Wieners out!
Butters
Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Yeah!
Butters
What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!
Wendy
[runs away from the rally]
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Wieners out!
Butters
Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!
Stan
[pulls down his pants and joins the rally]
Butters
You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!
The Broflovski master bedroom. Gerald brushes his teeth when he suddenly hears a flute playing. He checks the window and sees Dick playing on a tree branch.
Gerald
[whispers] Damn it! [waves his arms away from the window] I live here! Stop that! [shuts the curtains and lies on the bed next to Sheila]
Sheila
[stops reading and faces Gerald] You don't have to work tonight?
Gerald
No, nothing!
Sheila
Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.
Gerald
Got all caught up with work!
Sheila
Hey, I'm not complaining. [closes her book] It feels good to have you here.
Gerald
[gets off the bed and runs away] I'm going on a run!
South Park. Gerald is going for a run.
Gerald
[gets surprised by the car honking at him] Ah! [raises his fist] Fuck you! ["flips" his index fingers] Fuck you!
The Broflovski master bedroom at 2:43 a.m. Sheila is sleeping.
Gerald
[talks from the master bathroom] Yeah!
Sheila
[fully wakes up]
Gerald
Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!
Shiela
[gets off bed and walks near the master bathroom].
Gerald
Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! [chuckles]
Sheila
Gerald? [opens the door, gets scared of the Gerald's creepy face, screams, and runs away]
Gerald
[lays iPad in the sink and chases Sheila] Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!
The Broflovski hallway. Kyle notices Sheila screaming and exits his room.
Kyle
Everyone all right, guys?
Gerald
Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed.
The Broflovski kitchen. Gerald and Sheila sit down on the table to have talk.
Sheila
[wipes her eyes with tissue] One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!
Gerald
Nothing is going on!
Sheila
[points at Gerald] You hissed at me! You went [faces to her right, hisses, and then faces back at him].
Gerald
Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.
Sheila
But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald.
Gerald
Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different.
Sheila
Why?! Because it's not normal porn?
Gerald
Right!
Sheila
Like something really embarrassing?
Gerald
It's really embarrassing.
Sheila
Tell me!
Gerald
It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!
Sheila
Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?
Gerald
[stands up] See?! [walks closer to Sheila] It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?! [wipes his forehead] Whew! [moves closer to Sheila] I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. [walks to bed]
Sheila
Do you want me to pee on you?
Gerald
[stops and turns around] No!
Sheila
You only like watching other women pee?
Gerald
[walks closer to Sheila] Oh no, no! It's not like that.
Sheila
[turns around] Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?
Gerald
No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.
Sheila
You do, promise? [faces Gerald]
Gerald
[in complete shock] Yes?
The Broflovski master bedroom. Gerald lies on the bed with his top off. Romantic music plays as Sheila walks out of the master bathroom and onto the bed over Gerald's head, while wearing a sex outfit and peeing on him. Gerald gnarls moving his head back and forth.
Sheila
Am I doing it right, Gerald?
Gerald
Yep! [gnarls]
Ike
[watches Gerald and Sheila from the hallway]
Gerald
So hot, I mean [gnarls] warm! [gnarls some more]
Kyle
[walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions]
South Park Elementary: hallways. Eric Cartman sits on the stairs sewing a necklace and Kyle approaches him.
Kyle
Hi, Cartman.
Cartman
[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.
Kyle
I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff.
Cartman
Cool. That's cool.
Kyle
No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.
Cartman
I saw a vagina, Kyle.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
Kyle
You saw who's vagina?
Cartman
My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
Kyle
[lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.
Heidi
[overlaps Kyle's last few words and approaches Eric] Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks.
Cartman
[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
Heidi
The pink and blue one?!
Cartman
That's what my baby wanted.
Heidi
[raises her arms and cheers] Yay, [lowers her arms] put it on me!
Cartman
[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
Heidi
[faces Kyle] Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle. [talks to Eric while they hold hands] The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house.
Cartman
Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
[in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...
Cartman
He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
Heidi
Why? What's going on, Boo?
Cartman
I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
Kyle
[pauses in complete shock]
South Park park. Gerald sits on a bench and starts gnarling after seeing a dog pee on a tree. Dick sits down next to Gerald.
Gerald
It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.
Dick
[sighs] You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt.
Gerald
[speaks softer and faces Dick] Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!
Dick
Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?
Gerald
No! Don't you get it?! I went "Protocol Zero"! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me [faces away from the bench] ever again!
Dick
They will be able to, [faces Gerald] everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change.
Sizzler. Kyle sits with Cartman and Heidi next to each other.
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
Heidi
Shut up.
Cartman
[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.
Kyle
[starts to get bored]
Heidi
I don't even try to be funny.
Cartman
I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
Kyle
Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean "mess with Butters"? [drinks from mug]
Kyle
You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!
Cartman
[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
Heidi
What?
Cartman
You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
Kyle
That's not true at all!
Cartman
[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
Heidi
Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.
Cartman
[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
Heidi
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now.
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
Heidi
We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
Cartman
Humans on Mars.
South Park park. Dick and Gerald are sitting together on a bench.
Dick
I'm warning you, Skankhunt, [takes out his laptop and types] this video is really gonna rock your world.
Gerald
[talks softer] Can you please call me "Gerald"?!
Dick
[gives Gerald his laptop] It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here. [presses a button and faces away from the bench] This is why we all have to come together, Skank.
Internet video is played.
BBC Reporter
Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called [picture of guy with an actual troll behind him is shown] trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. "The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!" the Danish claim. [Danish music is played] As a new website, [Troll Trace headquarters is shown] Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached.
Bedrager
[World spinning with the word "STIMULATION" is shown] Every message, every comment [comment is scan, world stops spinning, and a tracer is shown] ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag [troll's true identity is shown] with the author's name, location, and [police barge into the troll's house] whole Internet history.
Gerald
[in complete shock] Fffffuuuuuccckkk!
Dick
I told you.
Interview is shown
BBC Reporter
And this is the man who has masterminded it all.
Bedrager
What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are.
Gerald wipes his forehead of sweat.
BBC Reporter
And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?
Bedrager
Uh, what do you mean?
BBC Reporter
Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?
Bedrager
Oh oh, right. [coughs and faces the camera] This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og dø.
The video ends.
Dick
I Google Translated the last part. He said "Come out troll, come out and die".
Gerald
This can't be happening.
Dick
By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public.
Gerald
[closes laptop] Then it's over. I'm dead.
Dick
[faces Gerald] You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope.
South Park Elementary cafeteria.
Kyle
[shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm]
The girls get upset]
Boys
Yeah! [one of them says "That's right." as they all gradually pull off their pants]
Butters
Good for you, Uncle Kyle!
Some of the girls leave while some of the boys lift Kyle up.
Secret room. Dick drags Gerald who is wearing a bandana over his eyes.
Dick
[takes off the bandana and crumples it in his shirt] Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42.
Ten other trolls are seen in the meeting.
Gerald
I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
Troll #1
It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind.
Gerald is in shock and Dick closes the door of the room.
Douche and a Danish
South Park Elementary playground. The boys and girls are yelling at each other as Nelly and Butters are about to fight each other.
Jason
Hit her!
Random Boy
Hit her, man!
Annie
Kick his ass, Nelly!
Red
All boys should die!
Lola
Take him out!
Nelly
I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Butters
[is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank.
Boys (except Butters)
Yeah!
Boys (except Butters)
Yeah!
Nelly
Pull up your stupid pants first.
Butters
Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
Clyde
Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid.
Wendy
He is stupid! Look at him!
Jimmy
At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
Boys (expect Butters and Jimmy)
Yeah!
Cartman
[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
Annie
Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it.
Red
Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!
Heidi
Hey, leave him alone! [walks from the boys side of the fight to near Cartman] Eric tries to help [spreads her arms] and you call him names?! [talks to Cartman] Sorry, babe, I had to step in.
Cartman
It's cool, Baby.
[Heidi and Cartman kiss each other and causing the others to be flabbergasted]
Wendy
Heidi?!
Annie
[faints]
Cartman
Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
Presidential speech break room. Publicist speaks with Garrison.
Advisor #1
All right sir [gives Garrison his lines], don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States.
Garrison
There's [flips through pages] still a chance, are you serious?!
Publicist #1
Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]
Garrison
[puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?
A campaign rally, later. "Make America Great Again." Chris Christie is at the podium]
Chris Christie
Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! [Mr. Garrison comes out to great fanfare and takes the mic.]
Crowd Members
Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! [somewhere in there a man shrieks. Garrison lights up a cigarette and starts pacing]
Garrison
So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. [cheers and applause]
Supporter
Ow!
Garrison
And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like "Oh good, you're gonna protect us?" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, "Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?" I say Yeah. She says "Why you got your finger in my ass?" I say "I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam." [the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the "fuck everyone to death," all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after "Fuck all the immigrants" and?" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez.
[Trolltrace.com, day. A camera zooms into it. Lennart Bedrager dances into view.]
Bedrager
[in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls.
Danes
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities.
Danes
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice.
Danes
[four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.
Dane 1
The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
Dane 2
Like-a here, in Denmark.
Dane 3
Help fund our project on social media today!
Danes
Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!
[The darkened room from last episode. The trolls are gathered there again to plan their next move.]
Dick
Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy.
Troll #2
They have an entire government at their disposal.
Dick
And we... have Skankhunt42.
Gerald
[sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?
Dick
I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
[South Park Elementary Gym, day. PC Principal is holding an assembly]
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!
Butters
[with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]
PC Principal
Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: "COME TOGETHER as a school"]
Cartman
Hey you guys?
Heidi
What's up? [the other kids stay silent]
Cartman
Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
Heidi
Eheh, stop, Eric.
Cartman
You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
Heidi
Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought "why not a school fundraiser?"
Cartman
Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
Heidi
What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]
Cartman
Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-
Heidi
When was this? Were we at Denny's?
Cartman
Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
Heidi
[giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?
Cartman
Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
Heidi
He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
Cartman
Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
Heidi
Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]
[Campaign headquarters. Garrison's advisers are exasperated after his disastrous rally. Caitlyn is polishing her nails]
Advisor #1
Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women.
Garrison
[satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]
Chris Christie
We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
Garrison
Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]
Chris Christie
A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
Garrison
Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists.
Advisor 2
You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
Garrison
I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever.
Chris Christie
You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]
[Campaign headquarters, outside. a crowd of people wait to hear from Garrison. He cracks the door open and looks out]
Supporter 1
What's goin' on?!
Supporter 2
What are ya doin?!
Garrison
[steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say "I told you so!" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]
Supporter 2
This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
Supporter 3
It's like he's not even trying!
Garrison
Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-
Supporter 2
Get him!
Garrison
Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]
Supporters
Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
Supporter 4
[ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!
[The Airport Hilton. A concierge walks the hallways, humming to himself, and stops by a private conference: "Rape Victims Anonymous"]
Andrew
[knocks on the door]
Anonymous821
What do you want? Go away.
Andrew
Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?
Anyomous821
We're fine. We don't need anything.
A Troll
[within the room] Some more creamer?
Anonymous821
Just some more creamer.
Andrew
Alright, well, I just wanna say "thanks for choosing the-" [the troll shuts the door]
Anonymous821
Okay, we're clear again.
Dick
You were saying, Skankhunt?
Gerald
Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?
Troll 4
Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
Gerald
No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh.
Anonymous821
Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
Gerald
It's not mean if it's hilarious.
Dick
If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?
Gerald
If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.
[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Nelson has a lesson on mammals on the board, but Heidi is talking to the class about something else.]
Heidi
Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called "Danishes for Denmark."
Cartman
[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
Heidi
We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]
Garrison
[frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?
Stan
Mr. Garrison?
Garrison
Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?
Token
Uh, aren't you running for President?
Garrison
Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right.
Chris Christie
[clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!
Garrison
I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-
Chris Christie
Mr. Garrison.
Garrison
What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes "Jack threw the ball." on the board.]
Chris Christie
You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!
Garrison
The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say "the slippery ball," can't we?
Chris Christie
Come on. [his advisers come in.]
Garrison
What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!
Butters
The bouncy ball?
Garrison
[grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]
[The Broflovski house, day. Gerald and Dick arrive and go inside. They carry with them keyboards, computers, cables...]
Gerald
Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey.
Sheila
Gerald, you're back from your convention?
Gerald
Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up.
Sheila
Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?
Gerald
Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.
Dick
Hello. [Gerald closes the door]
[Gerald's home office. Gerald and Dick sit on the floor putting the computers back in place.]
Dick
I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family.
Gerald
Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
Dick
And who is that?
Gerald
What?
Dick
I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
Gerald
I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz.
Dick
I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me "midget," even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have.
[The school cafeteria, day. A banner over the kitchen entrance reads "SCHOOL FUNDRAISER. LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER." All the kids are making Danishes and PC Principal supervises it all.]
Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
Cartman
We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
Heidi and Cartman
We came together as a skewl.
Cartman
Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride.
No more fighting, it's time for something new.

Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
[During the song, the following things are seen: Two kids come up to get some trays with freshly backed Danishes on them, two other kids hand them the trays. Stan, Wendy, and Millie spread frosting on the Danishes. Butters and Nelly do the same at another table. Red passes by. Nichole and Token prepare the batter, as do Tweek and a girl. Clyde and Bebe pack the Danishes up and hand them to Nelly, then move on to the next box. By the time the song ends, the kids look tired. Annie, Kyle, Kevin, and another girl are putting frosting on their Danishes.]
Heidi
I really feel like this is the start of something new! We're gonna help Denmark, and Denmark is gonna put an end to trolls.
Cartman
And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.
Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
Cartman
Terraform Mars.
[Shi Tpa Town, day. Mr. Garrison rans past City Wok]
Garrison
Oooooohhh. [stops to catch his breath, then sees his advisers and runs again] Oohh!
Adviser
He went this way!
Chris Christie
Get back here! You're acting like an idiot! [Behind the advisers is the crowd of supporters with their weapons]
Supporters
Get him! String him up! We put our faith in you, asshole!

Dick
Test test 1 2. This is Dildo Shwaggins. We are ready to commence the trashing of Denmark. All trolls report in.

Okay. everyone follow Skankhunt's lead. Don't get distracted, we are only trolling Denmark.

Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark.
[South Park, day. Sleet falls to the ground as the wind howls through town. Thunder rolls by. Garrison, dripping wet from the sleet, finds a door and steps inside - it's the South Park Community Center. He sees the members of Member Berries Anonymous seated around a circle, with an empty chair waiting for the random walk-in. Garrison's spray tan is washing off.]
Randy
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone.
Garrison
You, you're not gonna try and lynch me too?
Randy
No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat. [Garrison takes the seat] You wanna share with us what you're goin' through?
Garrison
[crying softly] It's all my fault. I just wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, you know? [takes out a napkin and blows his nose with it] I just- I thought we could fuck them all to death, and everyone started listening to me. Next thing I know I actually get the nomination from the Republicans!
Randy
It's not your fault, little guy.
Garrison
It is my fault! I told people I could make the country great again, but I didn't have a plan!
Randy
Not your fault.
Garrison
I got caught up in people cheerin' for me, bein' in the media every day. I, I led this entire election down the shitter.
Randy
You've gotta stop blaming yourself.
Garrison
Well then, whose fault is it?!
Randy
Here, catch. [tosses a member berry at him]
Member Berry
Member Lando Calrissian? Member tauntauns? Member? Member feeling safe?
Garrison
What the fuck is this?
Randy
That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more...
[The Broflovski house. Gerald is in bed, sleeping. Dick knocks on his bedroom door and Gerald wakes up. He checks for Sheila, but she's not in bed. He gets up to answer the door, and Dick shows him the latest headline: DENMARK IN TURMOIL!]
Dick
It's started! [smiles. Gerald smiles back, then grins.]
[The living room. Gerald and Dick run down to the sofa and take seats]
Gerald
Did they pick it up on Yahoo?
Dick
Don't know, but Google has it as the number one story.
Gerald
Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington!
Bill Keegan
Millions of people took to the Internet last night after shocking claims were made about the Danish company LEGO and their ties to ISIS.
Gerald
Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now.
CNN Anchor
It now appears the country of Denmark was the victim of a massive troll. The country is still reeling from the LEGO hoax story.
Bill Keegan
Tom, by the time the hoax was revealed the damage had already been done. Millions of people got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon, and when millions more came in to support Denmark, hundreds of millions more got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon.
Dick
We did it! We did it! [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
Gerald
Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet.
Kyle
I have a fundraiser at school.
Gerald
Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs.
Kyle
What?
Gerald
Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious.
Dick
The Guardian has a bunch of stories up about how the Denmark government isn't responding to even interview requests.
Gerald
Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark. [Dick grins]
[Trolltrace.com, day. Its executives run inside the building for an emergency meeting.]
Dane 2
Sir, public opinion of Denmark is-a very very shit.
Dane 3
All our social media pages are-a filled with million and millions of-a horrible comments.
Dane 4
And our crowd-funding sites are taken over too.
Dane 5
Everyone is making fun of us like we were goofballs.
Dane 6
How could-a this-a happen?
Lennart
Because that's what trolls DO! I should have known that once they got wind of our little plan, they would start trolling us!
Dane 7
So then Denmark isn't funding ISIS?
Lennart
Of course not!
Dane 1
But-a how do we prove that to the rest of-a the world?
Lennart
We can't respond, it will only make the trolls stronger! Our only choice is to go offline
Dane 5
You mean we have to quit Twitter?
Lennart
Everything, you ignoramus! The only way to stop the bleeding is for Denmark to get off social media! Pokkers Du Trold!
South Park Elementary, day. In front of the school, the kids have set up their Danishes for Denmark stand. Some of the kids are dressed in what appears to be Danish outfits]
Heidi
Hello. [a car rolls by] Buy a Danish to help stop trolling? How come nobody's stopping? Maybe this was a terrible idea.
Cartman
It was a great idea. [spots another car driving by] Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?
Driver
Heheh, fuck Denmark
Butters
[runs up with his boxes and throws then down] That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid!
Cartman
What?
Kyle
[arriving] It's true. Denmark got trolled last night. They left social media.
Heidi
Then, all of this was... for nothing.
Butters
I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls!
Wendy
How is this our fault?! At least we actually did the work!
Clyde
Oh yeah? You guys fucked up all the frosting!
Annie
You assholes overcooked them! [the kids begin to argue with each other]
Heidi
Oh no! This was a terrible idea! [leaves the booth]
Cartman
Heidi! [follows her]
[the side of the school, moments later. Heidi reaches a tree and sobs on it a little. Cartman catches up to her]
Heidi
I'm so stupid!
Cartman
Don't say that.
Heidi
Why did I even think I could bring the boys and girls together again?
Cartman
Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi. [puts his hand on her shoulder] I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes.
[The member berry anonymous meeting. Mr. Garrison is still there]
Randy
Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country. [stands by an easel with a Star Wars poster on it] The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance.
Garrison
I thought you were gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President.
Randy
Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's [removes the Star Wars poster to reveal a picture of a member berry orchard] when you get member berries. They're noting new. They date back all the way to the Roman Empire. [shows a painting of a woman giving her lover some member berries.] Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff.
Garrison
I think those are just grapes.
Randy
Thought so too till I zoomed in. [removes the painting to show a closeup of just the berries]
Member Berries
Member?
Randy
You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies.
Garrison
You almost make it sound like J.J. Abrams is responsible for this entire election.
Randy
Does this look familiar? [removes the closeup to show J.J. Abrams wearing a cap on which is written "MAKE STAR WARS GREAT AGAIN."]
Garrison
[takes a good look at the picture, then stands up] Ohh Jeeez.
[Trolltrace.com. Lennart Bedrager sits in the conference room alone]
Dane 2
Sir! We got a message from overseas. You really should see it.
Lennart
A message how? We're completely offline.
Dane 2
This was sent on VHS. Whoever sent it is-a completely offline too.
Lennart
Put it on the screen. [a video pops up with Cartman and Heidi on it.]
Cartman
People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.
Heidi
Stop baby, no I'm not.
Cartman
[whispers] You are, babe. Stop it.
Lennart
Who the hell are these people?
Dane 2
Just listen.
Cartman
[whispers] Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.
Heidi
I have an idea. I might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night.
Lennart
Get everyone back inside. If this girl really is that smart and funny, we might have another shot here. [the other Dane goes away]
Fort Collins
Mars in Cartman's fantasy.
Cartman
[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
Unnamed characters 1 and 2
[wave at Cartman] Hi!
Unnamed character 3
[waves at Cartman] Hi!
Cartman
Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!
M Burger. Cartman is smiling while on a date with Heidi.
Heidi
What are you thinking about, Babe?
Cartman
Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
Heidi
You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?
Cartman
[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.
Heidi
Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
Cartman
You're right. You're right, Heidi.
The Broflovski residence. Gerald is at his office trolling people.
Gerald
[repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]
Trolls
Hi Skankhunt!
Gerald
[gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!
Dick
We came to celebrate!
PurpleheadedQueeflicker
Not everyday you troll a whole country.
Anonymous821
[showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
[The trolls have sat down and laughed each other]
PurpleheadedQueeflicker
We did it!
Dick
I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.
Trolls
Yeah! Yeah!
Troll 7
You said it!
SupersexyLisa18
Thanks to us!
Dick
And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better.
Troll 4
No doubt about it.
Gerald
Wh-what are you talking about "next one"?
Dick
Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?
Anonymous821
We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
Gerald
[leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?
[Gerald and Dick walk to the kitchen]
Gerald
Why did you bring them here?!
Dick
What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.
Gerald
That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
Dick
But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
Gerald
The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
Dick
Of course it's political!
Gerald
No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!
Dick
I remember being called a fag for no reason.
Gerald
Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.
Dick
Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]
Marsh kitchen.
Garrison
Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.
Jar Berries
'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
Randy
[setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
Experiment Berry
'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!
Jar Berries
What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!
Experiment Berry
Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?
Randy
Uh, there has to be something.
Garrison
Try the acid.
Experiment Berry
'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]
Jar Berries
They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member.
Experiment Berry
[keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic.
Randy
Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.
Broflovski bathroom. Kyle sits on the toilet, using his phone and then hears a knock from the other side of the door]
Kyle
[tilts head up] Yeah.
Cartman
[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
Kyle
Oh, what do you want now?!
Cartman
Just a second. Please, Kyle?
Kyle
Hurry up!
Cartman
Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.
Kyle
Ah! Dude, what the fuck?
Cartman
Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
Kyle
I'm going to the bathroom!
Heidi
Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?
Kyle
[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman.
Cartman
[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
Gerald's office. Gerald keeps on trolling.
Gerald
Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?
Dick
Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.
Gerald
I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
Dick
Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.
Gerald
I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
Dick
[sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?
Gerald
No!
Dick
[sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
Gerald
[ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.
Turner residence. Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle walk near Heidi's room. Heide blocks the door before they go in.
Heidi
[To Kyle.] This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?
Kyle
What is?
Heidi
Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.
Cartman
Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
Heidi
Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look.
[Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle enter Heidi's room. Kyle walks closer to Heidi's wall to his shock]
Kyle
What is all this?
Heidi
To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it "emoji analysis". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.
Kyle
Wow, that's pretty smart.
Cartman
She's funny too, Kyle.
Heidi
After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.
Kyle
You mean like one of the teachers?
Heidi
I think... it's one of the parents.
Kyle
Are you sure?
Heidi
I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.
Kyle
Emoji analysis, it's genius!
Cartman
You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
Denmark. People are living their usual lives while some mourn at Freja Ollegard's grave. The setting moves to TrollTrace Headquarters.
Danes
[sing] En junker red ved juletid
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Omkring ham dalet sneen hvid

Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Han stred sig frem i regn og blæst Med et der segnede hans hest Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang tjing nutillej [stop singing]

Dane 8
[runs towards Bedrager] Sir, take a look at the [shows Bedrager analysis] statistical analysis. The servers are working.
Bedrager
So then we don't need any more funding?
Dane 9
[walks to Bedrager] No, sir. Using Heidi's emoji analysis, we have the final piece of the puzzle.
Dane 5
So far we have narrowed down the location of the troll attack on Denmark. [walks to map of the U.S. with state of Colorado highlighted] It is a location in the middle of the United States: a place they call "Colorido".
Bedrager
Colorido? That's a very goofy name.
Dane 5
We believe that very soon the servers will give us the place in Colorido that the troll originated.
Bedrager
[walks closer to map] Hmm hmm. Go on and hide in your cave, little troll. Soon, everyone will know where you live.
Marsh kitchen. Randy gazes the berry with electricity while its in pain.
Randy
[stops putting in electricity] Damn it! [takes off flashlight] Nothing kills these things!
Garrison
We have to keep trying. [walks to the jar and grabs it] Where did they go?
Randy
They're not in the jar? [turns around] That's it. Look, it's over.
Garrison
No, I'll go find more. [leaves kitchen]
Randy
[follows Garrison] It's over! Don't you get it?! [walks closer to Garrison] Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.
Garrison
Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?
Randy
[walks away from Garrison] There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison. [stops walking] The American people have to be made to understand what's going on here. [turns around] You're gonna have to talk to them.
Garrison
[raises his hands near his head] No, no! I am done giving political speeches: I've tried being dirty, I tried being vulgar. [spreads his arm a little] Nothing matters!
Randy
[walks closer to Garrison] For the first time ever, [stops walking] you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you.
Garrison
Well that's just impossible.
Randy
You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that.
Garrison
[lays his hand on his face] Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was.
Randy
All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.
Garrison
Oooh geeeeez!
[Kyle's room, day. Kyle is at his desk working on math problems. His door is open and Cartman walks in.]
Cartman
Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.
Kyle
She wasn't being funny.
Cartman
Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!
Kyle
I don't!
Cartman
You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave]
Kyle
Cartman, [leaves his chair] I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right?
Cartman
Yeah, to catch trolls.
Kyle
So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together.
Cartman
[a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.
Kyle
Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.
Cartman
[thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters]
[The Bijou, day. Cartman and his mom leave the theater]
Liane
Did you like the movie, hon?
Cartman
No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] "Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it." [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present]
[Kyle's room, present day]
Cartman
How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!
Kyle
It's available to everyone, stupid!
Cartman
I gotta go! [runs out]
[Randy's kitchen, night. The lights are out, only the moon shines in through the window above the sink.]
Unknown Memberberries
Heehee, hurry! Come on, we have to hurry! Let's go.
Memberberry 1
[rolls away from toaster] This way, this way! We have to go this way, 'member?
Memberberry 2
[bounces away from toaster] Oh, I 'member!
Memberberry 3
[rolls away from toaster] Come on, we have to hurry! [rolls while Berry 1 bounces]
Memberberry 4
[bounces away from toaster] 'Member Jabba the Hut? [bounces while following the others]
Memberberry 2
Yeah! Come on Tubbs, you have to keep up! 'Member?! [rolls while following the others]
Tubbs

Okay, almost there.

Shh.
Memberberry 4

Memberberry 3
[stops] Oh I 'member. [berries keep on moving].
Tubbs
Hehehe. Are we almost there?
Memberberry 1
Shh.
Memberberry 2
Come on, 'member?
Memberberry 4
Oh I 'member!
The Broflovski residence. Dick rings the doorbell and Gerald answers.
Dick
I miss my friend.
Gerald
Oh you got to be--Are you joking?!
Dick
I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again.
Gerald
Buddies like when? When were we buddies?
Dick
Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling.
Gerald
I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids, [raises his arms] and shit to do!
Dick
Why are you mad at me'?
Gerald
Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!
Dick
I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow.
Gerald
[turns to his side] Oh here we go!
Dick
When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh.
Gerald
[faces Dick] Yes it is!
Dick
If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny?
Gerald
You mean my [shows his phone to Dick with image of Sheila Photoshopped] fucking screensaver.
Dick
It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick.
Gerald
And what are [points at Dick] you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid!
Dick
At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs?
Gerald
Stop trolling me.
Dick
One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.
Gerald
Stop fucking trolling me. [shuts the front door]
TrollTrace Headquarters. Dane 2 walks to Bedrager while singers sings "Tjing Tjang Tjing".
Danes
Den jomfru sad i høje torn
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Og vendte ham som til forn Tjing tjang tjing nutillej

Dane 2
We have it! We think we have it! [stops walking] The emoji analysis worked. We've found the IP address of the troll that trolled us.
Bedrager
[turns around] Triangulate the servers.
[servers triangulated an area on North Colorado]
Bedrager
Focus everything on that area. It's time to see what these puppies can do.
Fort Collins, Colorado, MLKKK's house. MLKKK types at his computer and hears an air-raid siren and then turns on the TV.
News Reporter
Once again, if you live in the city of Fort Collins, there is a chance that all your emails and your entire Internet history has been made accessible to the public.
MLKKK
[checks his neighbor who is seen running out of the house screaming]
Fort Collins Citizen 1
[exits the house] Who the fuck are these emails to, and what the, what the fuck is MarriedButHorny.com?! [throws the Mac at her husband]
MLKKK
[sees his phone and picks it up with caution] Hello?
Unknown Caller
I know where you live now you son-a bitch.
MLKKK
[throws his phone on his desk and runs away to his car where he drives]
Fort Collins Citizen 2
I've been hacked! Help me I've been hacked!
Everyone in Fort Collins is panicking.
Fort Collins Citizen 3
They'll never forgive me! [jumps down from a high building]
MLKKK
[quickly presses the brake pedal, but crashes to the car in front of him. He leaves his car behind]
Fort Collins Citizen 4
[gets out of her car] They know everything I said about them! The club knows--
MLKKK
[pushes the woman] Get away from me! [runs away, but then gets stopped]
Unknown Caller
Hello MLKKK! You called my daughter "R2-D2". You know how long I waited this day, you son-a bitch! [throws a gasoline and lights a match on MLKKK, causing him to burn in pain]
Unknown Caller's Daughter
Is he burning, Pa?!
Unknown Caller
He's burning bright, little girl.
A highway. A toy car is driven with a few Memberries on them. The berries talked while the song "Africa" is played.

Oh shit, hang on. [pulls the car over and stops the song]
[the berries show left the car and opened the trunk to reveal a hostage berry]
Memberberry 1
Hey you, shut the fuck up!
Memberberry 2
Yeah, we're gonna kill you, 'member?
Mickey
Oh, I 'member. [trunk gets shut]
The Memberberries dance and talk while "Africa" is playing.
Toto
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Memberberry 3
Oh, 'member this song?
Memberberry 4
Sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
I love this song, it was fanta'tic, 'member?
Unknown Memberberries
Oh I 'member. Oh I love it when you 'member! 'Member! 'Member?
Gerald's work office. Gerald watches a news report on his computer.
News reporter
Complete panic and mass-hysteria tonight as the City of Fort Collins has been hacked.
Gerald
Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it.
News reporter
The Danish are taking complete credit for the cyber-attack, blaming its successfully exposed and notorious troll. [MLKKK's picture and identity is shown] The man has been identified as the Internet troll MLKKK, and was burned alive by one of his apparent victims.
Gerald
Ah!
News reporter
The Danish claimed this was only a beta-test and soon the servers will be available worldwide. [turns his head to his left] Wait, so like they'll be releasing everyone's Internet history? Uh, I gotta go. [runs away]
Gerald
No! No no no no no! [FaceTimes Dick] Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history!
Dick
[ends the call]
Gerald
Ahhh!
Mars in Cartman's fantasy. There's a severe dust storm.
Cartman
Not kewl! Not kewl! [holds onto a rock and sees someone caught in the storm, flying away] Not kewl! [tries to walk to the station]
Unnamed character 3
[holds onto a station] Wait!
Unnamed character 1
Have fun! [gets blown away by storm]
[roler coaster gets damaged]
Cartman
It's all falling apart! Weak!
Cartman's room. Heidi notices Cartman is worried.
Heidi
What is it, Eric? What's wrong?
Cartman
I-I, I don't know.
Heidi
Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember?
Cartman
It's just hard.
Heidi
You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always.
Cartman
And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.
Heidi
Yeah.
Cartman
And, and during the movie I was like "Wait, where is my phone?" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said "Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman," and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, "I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,"; and I was like "No, that's not cool!" and he said "Yeah," and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!
Heidi
Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know.
Cartman
So you totally believe me?
Heidi
Of course. [Cartman and her touch hands] You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe.
Cartman (fantasy)
[sees Mars restored] Kewl! [leaps]
Heidi
You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.
Cartman (fantasy)
[holds onto a rock, noticing a severe dust storm] Ugh! No, [lets go of the rock] nooo!
A campaign. Mr. Garrison gives a speech.
Garrison
My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry, [Gerald is seen in a bar, worried] and then I turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous. Slowly, people started paying attention to me and I guess it made me feel powerful. Well now the chickens have come home to roost. [Kyle, Ike, and Sheila are seen having dinner in their home] Sooner or later, we all get exposed. [Gerald sees his family having dinner] We're all held accountable for what we say, what we do. [Garrison is seen again] There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new Star Wars was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that The Force Awakens was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.
Clinton's office. Two FBI agents enter.
FBI agent 1
The Danish claim they will soon have the ablity to publish anyone's Internet history. We have to act fast, Mrs. Sandwich.
Clinton
I'll have you treat me with more respect. Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elects Sandwich.
FBI agent 1
We may not want to get too far ahead ourselves. [takes out a file of Skankhunt42 from envelope] TrollTrace must be stopped. [gives file to Clinton]
Clinton
Who is Skankhunt42?
FBI agent 1
We believe he's the only one who can save you now.
A restaurant. The memberberries are together.
Memberberry 1
Here we are. We made it.
Tubbs
We did?
Memberberry 2
Yeah, we have to go with Plan B, 'member?
Memberberry 3
Ooh, I 'member.
Memberberry 4
[talks to Hostage Berry] Sorry asshole, end of the line for you.
Mickey
That's okay, I 'member. [gets pushed into a drink]
Waiter
[grabs the drink and brings it to a table] Here you are, ma'am, gin and tonic.
Caitlyn
[grabs drink] Thanks.
Waiter
Should be an interesting election this year, huh?
Caitlyn
[takes a sip] Buckle up, buckaroos.
Oh, Jeez
South Park Community Center, night. The 2016 Presidential Election Night Viewing Party is over. Hillary's campaign poster is seen on an exterior wall. One man is passed out on the lawn off to the right with a bottle of beer nearby, another man throws up after walking out the doors. Most everyone there is either tired or disappointed. Inside, there are a few more people watching the results
Bill Keegan
And uh, definitely a bit of a surprise here. Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?
Randy
What have you done?! You maniacs! [a man seated near the entrance pulls a gun out his back pocket and shoots himself in the head, falling off the chair.]
Bill Keegan
We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go.
President Elect Douche
[with Caitlyn beside him] The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again.
Randy
This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
President Elect Douche
All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!
Butters' house, day. Cartman is at his front door knocking. Butters answers it
Cartman
Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
Butters
What do you want?!
Cartman
[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
Butters
Well I don't know, Eric.
Cartman
I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
Butters
NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!
Cartman
A traitor?
Butters
Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!
Cartman
Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
Butters
Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!
Cartman
Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.
Butters
Oh God, listen to you! [mimics his last sentence] "Please don't call her that I really like her." You've changed, Eric! You've really changed! Now get the fuck out of my house! [Cartman is taken back, but closes his mouth and walks out the door. Butters slams it closed behind him]
Channel 9 News. A reporter stands near some scaffolding around a newly-walled city
Tom
A historic election, and all the votes are in. Except of course in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. It's been several days now since Fort Collins was hacked. Everyone's e-mails and Internet history became accessible to the public after being targeted by the Danish Trolltrace program. According to our eye in the sky, their votes will not be tallied anytime soon.
Eye in the sky
It's complete bedlam inside the city limits, Chris. [traffic accidents at every intersection, a broken fire hydrant spewing a geyser of water, three giraffes running through the streets...] Since the city was hacked there have been murder, suicide, and complete lack of civility. We also understand that nearly everyone within Fort Collins who was married is now divorced. Back to you, Tom.
Tom
This barricade behind me was put up not only to make sure nobody goes into Fort Collins, but also to make sure nobody gets out, since there's no telling whose Internet histories they've seen
Dangling Man
[at the top of the barricade] Please! [Tom glances at him and the camera zooms in] My wife is so pissed at me! [a bullet strikes him from the air and he falls to his death several stories down.] Guh!
Tom
[faces the camera] The defiant Danish company is still declaring Trolltrace a success, and claims that it will be available worldwide at any moment.
South Park, night. A helicopter flies over the kids' neighborhood and a camera on the chopper scans the area. A night sun comes on and focuses on a house. It's Gerald's house - he looks out a living room window and panics
Gerald
Oh God... [he looks up at the sky and sees the helicopter] Oh God! [he goes outside for a better look. Two government vehicles pull up right away and agents pour out of them]
Lead Agent
We have him. The subject is home. [Gerald looks around, then runs inside and closes the door]
Inside the Broflovski house. Gerald runs past the stairs as Kyle and Ike come down to see what's going on.
Kyle
Dad, what the?
Ike
What's goin' on, Dad? [Sheila comes out of the kitchen]
Gerald
[runs up to her] They're coming for me, Sheila! They know everything!
Sheila
About what??
Gerald
Everything I did online! It's over!
Lead Agent
Sir, if you'll come with us?
Agent 2
We need to speak with you?
Sheila
[shields him] You people really have nothing better to do?! What he did online is his business! Or maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one that likes being peed on and I sucked him into it. Did you know that urine is 100% sterile?! How dare you burst into our home! [a shot of Ike and Kyle looking confused]
Gerald
Sheila!
Sheila
Urologia has been around since the time of the Greeks!
Agent 2
Sir. Please come with us now. [Gerald walks towards them]
Sheila
Gerald, you don't have to listen to them.
Gerald
I'm sorry, Sheila. Please know that I love you so much. Goodbye Kyle, Ike. [all three look on helplessly]
Neighborhood park, night, the bench. Heidi and Cartman are there again. They're wearing Beauty and Beast shirts, respectively. Cartman looks helpless
Heidi
I can't believe it, babe. I really didn't think things would end up like this.
Cartman
Yeah. Neither did I.
Heidi
I just... feel so disconnected from the world, you know? I really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything, like you always say.
Cartman
You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.
Heidi
I'm just glad I have you. At least I know you believe girls are smart.
Cartman
You are smart, Heidi.
Heidi
And funny too, right? You're always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny.
Cartman
[getting emotional] You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit.
Heidi
Hey, are you okay? This election really got to you too, huh?
Cartman
Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future.
Heidi
Me too, babe. [scoots in and rests her head on his shoulder] Me too.
Freemont Bridge, night. One of the government vehicles stops at one end of it and the agents take Gerald out of it.
Gerald
Where are you taking me? [the agents take him down the riverbank to the riverbed] Wait! Please, there's been a mistake! Someone set me up! I'm not Skankhunt42! [the agents take him to a shadowy figure under the bridge] Dildo?
Hillary Clinton
[comes out of the shadows] Hello. Mr. Cunt.
Gerald
Turd Sandwich... I don't understand.
Hillary Clinton
Things... have not turned out the way they were supposed to. This election was stolen. And while this government is still in power, we have to prove it. We've come to ask for your help.
Gerald
My help?
Hillary Clinton
Leave us. [the agents leave and head up the riverbank] As I understand, there's quite a lot you've done online you don't wanna have come out. But I also understand you weren't trying to get a woman to kill herself. You were just being funny.
Gerald
Exactly!
Hillary Clinton
The Trolltrace program is the most sophisticated of its kind. The government has only a few short weeks to try and use that technology to stop the President-elect from taking office.
Gerald
What do you want me to do?
Hillary Clinton
You've proven one thing: that you have the ability to pretend to be someone you're not. We wanna send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology.
Gerald
You mean like... like James Bond? [looking hopeful]
Hillary Clinton
Totally like James Bond. You and I need each other, Skank. What do you say?
Mr. Garrison's house. Randy knocks on the front door repeatedly
Randy
Garrison! Garrison, what the fuck have you done?! [Caitlyn answers the door] Where is he?!
Caitlyn
He's resting. He's had a busy week.
Randy
[goes inside] Yeah I'll say he has! [sees him on the sofa and walks up to him] Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?!
Garrison
Yeah. Fuck them all.
Randy
You admitted you didn't know how to run a country! You agree people were supporting you just because they like the new Star Wars, and you begged me to help you lose!
Garrison
I changed my mind. The new Star Wars was actually really good.
Randy
No it wasn't!! Something else has to have happened!!
Caitlyn
Maybe some people enjoy nostalgia and going back to what feels comfortable.
Randy
There's nothing great about rehashing all the old Star Wars moments into a new- [Caitlyn vomits out a gusher of member berry juice.] Ah! Aaah! Aaaaaah! [bits of member berries are on Randy's face] Aaah. [member berry voices are heard] I, I suppose... I suppose I can watch it one more time. Give it another chance.
Turd Sandwich's office
Agent 2
[hands him a dossier] You're flying to Denmark under the guise of being a foreign ambassador. The Danish think you want to help them. Here's your fake passport and here are your nifty camera glasses. [the lead agent hands those over to Gerald]
Gerald
Wow...
Agent 3
Once inside the Trolltrace building, you will plant this. [the fourth agent walks forward with a briefcase] Looks like an ordinary briefcase, but at exactly 9:30 Danish standard time. the case will open, detonating an EMP device that will take out their entire facility.
Agent 2
It'll fry all their equipment, servers, and backup computers. After it detonates we'll be on the roof to pick you up.
Gerald
[smiles] And then everything can go back to normal.
Lead Agent
One last thing: to pass yourself off as the ambassador, you have to pretend to be from the Turkish Islands. Are you any good at... changing your voice?
Gerald
That depends. Are you asking me? Or are you asking... [does his first impersonation] me, Andy the drunk sheriff? *hic* [next impersonation] Or me, the old Irish dart player? [third impersonation - Peter Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fourth impersonation - Stewie Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fifth impersonation - Chris Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [The lead agent and Agent 2 give him thumbs up]
Ike's room, day. Ike is playing Minecraft when he gets a FaceTime call - it's his father.
Gerald
Hi Ike, it's Daddy. Everything OK there? [Ike look around] Listen, buddy, you remember how we talked about trolling and just between us guys we agreed it was pretty funny? [Kyle walks by Ike's room, hears Gerald's voice and stops to look inside] Well it turns out that even the-
Kyle
Dad! [runs into Ike's room] Where are you?
Gerald
Oh, hey Kyle.
Kyle
Dad, what's going on? Mom is freaking out.
Gerald
Tell your mom everything's fine, okay? I'm helping out the government. It's top-secret stuff, but everything's finally gonna be okay.
Kyle
No, Dad, I need you back home. Please, I-I'm so confused right now.
Gerald
Kyle, you've gotta lighten the fuck up, buddy. Every day with you it's "Dad, I feel guilty about this. Dad, I'm so confused about that." You're a kid. You're supposed to just laugh and make fun of shit. [smiles] Stop being such a pussy, okay pal? Fuck. [hangs up, leaving Kyle a bit stunned]
Ike
Daddy called you a pussy.
South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal stands before a big screen with speakers on either side
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. I know that many of us were shocked to the core with last night's election. But we cannot allow our school to be any further divided. It is time to try and start the healing process, and so here, to try and help us heal, is Bill Clinton. [claps. He's the only one to do so. Bill Clinton steps out from behind the screen]
Bill Clinton
Hi kids. I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the first gentleman in America. Thank you. Even though we might have lost the election, it doesn't mean that my work to be a gentleman is goin' to stop. I'm gonna ask all you boys to agree to join Bill Clinton's Gentleman Club. [its logo shows up on screen] But I can't do it alone. Sometimes, I wish there were two of me. Oh wait, there are. Oh Bill!
Bill Cosby
Yes, Bill?
Bill Clinton
Come on out here.
Bill Cosby
Hello, boys and girls.
Bill Clinton
I'm Bill
Bill Cosby
And I'm Bill
Bill & Bill
And together we're Bill and Bill
Two birds of a feather comin' to your school Gonna show you all about what gentlemen do. When you're not quite sure how you feel Ask Bill and Bill.

Bill Clinton
Say, Bill?
Bill Cosby
Yes, Bill?
Bill Clinton
Would you like to join my gentlemen's club?
Bill Cosby
You know I would, Bill.
Heidi's room, day. She's writing some stuff down when Cartman enters her room.
Cartman
Heidi? Heidi!
Heidi
Hey babe. What's the matter?
Cartman
Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important.
Heidi
Okay.
Cartman
Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.
Heidi
I know, babe. You've talked about how humankind needs to get to Mars for a few weeks now.
Cartman
No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. [walks around a bit] I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever.
Heidi
Babe, there's no way to get to Mars right now.
Cartman
Yes. [walks up to hold her hand] Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us.
Heidi
I trust you with everything I have.
Cartman
That's kewl.
Copenhagen, day. "Tjing Tjang Tjing" plays. The arrivals area is shown, and Gerald descends on an escalator. The music switches to an action-paced score.
Ticket Agent
Your name, please?
Gerald
Miller. Von Miller. [adjusts his cuff links] I'm the ambassador of technology from the Turkish Islands.
Ticket Agent
Oh yes of course, Ambassador Miller. You're here to support our country's-a Trolltrace program, yes?
Gerald
That's right.
Ticket Agent
Your escort is-a right over there. [points to her left. Dane 5 waits at the exit holding a welcome sign up: "AMBASSADOR VON MILLER"]
A Trolltrace vehicle. Dane 2 is driving, Dane 5 is in the passenger seat, and Gerald is in the back seat.
Gerald
Nice little country you have here. Really clean.
Dane 5
Yes, ambassador. Denmark is ranked the nicest place to live in all the world almost every year. [the car stops at the Trolltrace entrance and the occupants step out] This is it, ambassador. All of Trolltrace is housed in this building.
Gerald
Mhm. [takes a picture. They go inside and Gerald looks around the lobby] Wow, this is really impressive. [takes a few more pictures]
Lennart Bedrager
[appears] Thank you for coming. [Gerald turns around] Welcome to Trolltrace. I cannot tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit, [somewhat ominously] Ambassador Von Miller. We have so much to talk about. Won't you join me upstairs for frikadellers and leverpostejs?
A table at a restaurant. Stan is in a chair.
Stan
I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry. [Wendy is shown facing him across the table] I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you.
Bill Clinton
Okay, okay, that's good, but now, make sure she knows how you're gonna change.
Stan
I am gonna change. I, I am.
Bill Clinton
Whether she takes you back or not.
Stan
Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back.
Bill Cosby
[pops into view as he leans back on his chair] Yeah, but if you're just changin' to get her back, then you're bein' selfish again.
Stan
Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy. [some knocking nearby. Stan and Wendy look in the direction of the knocking]
Butters
Traitor! [Stan, Wendy, and Bill Clinton see him outside with four other boys - Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Francis] Fuck you, Stan! You're a traitor! [drops his pants to show his wiener and puts his fist high up in the air]
Stan
Go away Butters! [Cosby leans back to see what's going on]
Bill Clinton
Who's that?
Butters
How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! [steps forward and presses his wiener onto the window]
Bill Cosby
Oh, he's pressin' pickle!
Trolltrace building, boardroom. Gerald and Lennart enjoy a meal, surrounded by servers outside the room.
Lennart
Enjoying the frikadellers?
Gerald
Oh. Yes, they're nice.
Lennart
And the leverpostejs are seasoned to your liking?
Gerald
Ah, I wouldn't know. Ha, haha.
Lennart
You keep-a checking your watch, Ambassador Von Miller. Are you late for something?
Gerald
No, no I, I-I'm just anxious to get a look at your servers. They must be quite impressive.
Lennart
Yes. Well a database that can identify everybody's Internet activity is-a very complex. I'm so pleased you want to help us rid the world of-a trolls. Do you happen to recognize... [clicks on a remote controller and a black and white picture of Freja Ollegard appears onscreen] this woman?
Gerald
Ahhh... no.
Lennart
Her name was-a Freja Ollegard. She was Denmark's-a national treasure. [pours himself some Gold Top wine] She had an amazing breast-cancer awareness website, and some... troll... decided to Photoshop-a wieners in her mouth. [Gerald stifles a laugh by putting a napkin over his mouth]
Gerald
Oh, wow. That's terrible.
Lennart
Her final straw was when she was trolled on a live TV show. [pours some more wine into a second glass] When the troll posted comments about-a breast cancer with-a fake doctors' names. Would you like to know what the doctors' names were? The first one was a Dr. Boobsoff. Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff. [Gerald stifles a second laugh] Then I believe there was a Dr. Juerdior Titsgo. [Gerald stifles a third laugh] But probably most insensitive of all was when the troll said he was Dr. Ipples. Dr. Now I'm Only-n Ipples. [Gerald stifles a fourth laugh, but it's getting harder and harder to do so. Lennart notices and gets in his face] Are you alright, Von Miller?!
Gerald
I'm fine. I... I think the frikadellers gave me a little heartburn. Ah, if you wouldn't mind, could I see the servers now?
Lennart
It would be my pleasure.
The Stotch house, night. The doorbell rings and Stephen answers it.
Bill Clinton
Hello, I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the First Gentleman in America.
Stephen
Oh my gosh! Honey, it's the nearly-Gentleman!
Bill Clinton
May I come into your lovely home?
Stephen
Well of course, that's very gentlemanly of you. [Clinton enters]
Linda
Oh my goodness, it's him. Hello, sir.
Bill Clinton
Hello, ma'am. I wasn't expecting someone so stunning. [takes her right hand and kisses it] I'm so sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I could speak with your son.
Stephen
Oh. Well, I'm afraid Butters is grounded for pressing pickle at the nail salon again.
Linda
Stephen, this is a guest, a gentleman.
Stephen
Uh but, but of course we'll make an exception. [takes Clinton upstairs and to Butters' door] Butters has been grounded quite a lot lately. Don't know what's gotten into him. [unlocks the seven locks and latches used to keep Butters in his room]
Bill Clinton
Well, maybe I can help.
Stephen
That'd be great. No matter how hard we ground him, he remains defiant. [finally opens the bedroom door. Butters is standing on his bed looking out the window, with his wiener out] Butters, stop smooshing snake! The gentleman is here to speak with you.
Butters
[over his shoulder] What?
Bill Clinton
Hello, young man. Come on, sit down. Let's talk.
The Marsh house, dinner time. The family is eating dinner, but Stan is missing and Randy is still under the influence of member berry juice.
Randy
Well, I don't know about you guys, but I sure am excited. America is going to be great again. Aren't you excited, gang?
Shelly
No I'm not excited! It sucks, Dad! This country is gonna suck for four years!
Randy
Aww, come on, Shelly. We've learned that women can be anything. Except for President.
Sharon
Randy! You just spent the last month convincing me that the only reason people wanted to go back was because of a childish nostalgia they all had for the new Star Wars!
Randy
Have you really watched it, Sharon? It has more to offer than just nostalgia. Let's all watch it again tonight.
Sharon
What?! I don't wanna watch Star Wars any more than I- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]
Shelly
Dad, what the hell is wrong with y- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]
Trolltrace headquarters, day. Lennart Bedrager opens the server vault.
Lennart
Please, ambassador, explore the servers at your leisure. Let us know if you have any questions.
Gerald
Thank you. [the Danes leave, and Gerald goes into spy mode, entering the vault and locking it. He takes pictures every few steps and passes by Dick unaware]
Dick
You can stop being an idiot now.
Gerald
[notices him] What the-? Dildo?
Dick
Skankhunt.
Gerald
What the fuck are you doing here?
Dick
I was sent here by the government to do international espionage like James Bond.
Gerald
Nononononono, that's what I'm doing. Hillary Clinton says I was the only one capable of-
Dick
Of being smart and funny enough to pull it off. Yeah, that's what she told all of us.
Gerald
All of us? Who? [Dick looks to his left and Gerald follows his gaze. The other trolls in their group are there with their own briefcases]
Anonymous 821
Hey Skankhunt.
Gerald
What the hell is going on?
Dick
Don't you get it? The government made some kind of deal with the Danish. They handed us over so they wouldn't go forward with their Trolltrace program. They wanted the troll who killed Freja Ollegard and his associates. We got sold out because of you!
Gerald
No! [runs to the vault door] No, you've got to let me out of here! I'm not one of them! [pounds on the door in vain. The briefcases begin to beep]
Anonymous 821
[notices] Hey look, it's 9:30. The briefcases are about to go off. [When the briefcases pop open, they prepare to die, but they get rickrolled instead.]
Butters' room, night. Bill Clinton is still talking to Butters, who's still mad. They sit side by side on Butters' bed.
Bill Clinton
What do you think you're gonna achieve, young man? Do you really think all this pickle-pressing is gonna get you anywhere?
Butters
Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!
Bill Clinton
What happened, son? Did a girl break your heart?
Butters
[suddenly tears up] No.
Bill Clinton
I know. I know how hard they can be. But... somethin's about to happen that you aren't aware of. [stands up and walks off a bit] You see, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch. She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback. And we are all completely fucked. It's my fault, really. I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit. And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you: she is piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissed. [walks back to the bed and sits down] Now, our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because, we're very close to the end.
Butters
The end? Of what?
Bill Clinton
Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online. And unless we start kissin' their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.
A hill in Hawthorne, California. Cartman and Heidi make their way to its crest.
Heidi
Eric, we're so far from home.
Cartman
We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.
Heidi
You really think there's hope?
Cartman
Yes. I do. [before them is SpaceX]
Members Only
Tom's Rhinoplasty. A government agent speaks with Bannon.
Government agent
The political world is watching, Bannon. [gives Bannon a file] We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition.
Bannon
All indications are that his transition [flips a page] is going to be fine.
Surgeon
[walks by] We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like.
Caitlyn
I'll go.
Caitlyn walks into a technologically advanced room where Garrison is seen having a blond, push-back wig put on his head by a mechanical arm.
Garrison
[talks with Caitlyn] Well, do I look presidential?
Caitlyn
Honestly, you look twenty years younger.
Garrison
They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this, [lowers his body] like look. [shows his stank face] I can do this. [shows his stank face again] This is, this is my stank face. [shows a different stank face] It's like, I'm not listening to you, see? [shows his other stank face] They did a really good job on my stank lips.
Caitlyn
It's an amazing transition.
Garrison
Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters... [sits up straight] in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.
[the machine closes enseals Garrison]
SpaceX. Cartman and Heidi walk to the desk.
Secretary
Can I help you?
Cartman
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
Secretary
...Okay.
Cartman
We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
Secretary
...That'd be an understatement, yes.
Cartman
Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
Secretary
Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
Cartman
What others?
[Cartman, Heidi, and the secretary turn their heads see a bunch of other people waiting, including Cher singing]
Cher
[garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...
Cartman
What the fuck, dude?!
Secretary
Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
Cartman
Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
Cher
[garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...
South Park Elementary, principal's office.
PC Principal
God [knocks down papers] dammit! [knocks down lamp] How the fuck did this happen?!
Mackey
[knocks the door and opens it] Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you.
PC Principal
I told you to leave me alone, Mackey! [slams fist on the desk] I'm not in the mood!
Mackey
But, but sir, the president elect is here. [moves away from Garrison]
Garrison
[enters the office with two Secret Service agents following him] So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope.
PC Principal
Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison.
Garrison
Excuse me?
PC Principal
Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President.
Garrison
That's better, bitch. [sits down and takes out a piece of gum]
PC Principal
Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election.
Garrison
Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?
PC Principal
I know we've had some differences, uh...
Garrison
I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and "learn their language", "be more open-minded".
PC Principal
I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
Garrison
Are you really? [makes stank face] Are you really sorry? [makes different stank face] Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really dry. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud?
PC Principal
[is in complete shock]
Outside of unknown club. Two people got out of the club. The berries head to a tiny door.
Unknown Berries
Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
'Member when Han shot Greedo?
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member Greedo.
Tubbs
Ha, I 'member Greedo.
Memberberry 3
'Member?
Memberberry 1
[knocks at the small door]
Guard Berry
[opens small window] What's the password, 'member?
Memberberry 3
Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
You 'member?
Guard Berry
I 'member. [opens the door, lets the berries in, and then closes the door immediately]
Inside a Memberberry bar. Random berries keep on saying "'Member".
Memberberry 1
Ha ha, 'member this place? [hops away]
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member. [rolls away]
Memberberry 4
[hops away] 'Member the Tantive IV?
Memberberry 1
Oh, I love that ship. [stops moving]
Memberberry 3
[goes with the other berries and talks to an old berry] Hi, it's us, 'member?!
Don
Ah sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 4
We did the thing with throwing Mickey in the drink, 'member?!
Don
Ah sure, I 'member; just 'cause of youse, we won the election.
Tubbs
Yeah yeah, 'member?
Don
Waiter, round of drinks for our heroes here, 'member?
Waiter Berry
I 'member.
Don
You done good poisoning the lady's drink. Now our man is in office, 'member? But I still have things I need you to do.
Tubbs
Hehe, hehe, I 'member.
TrollTrace Headquarters: vault. Gerald repeatedly knocks on the exit door with all his might.
Gerald
Please, you have to let me outta here!
Dick
Skankhunt, stop!
Bedrager
[talks from above] Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself.
Gerald
[walks to see Bedrager's face]
Bedrager
Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party.
Troll 4
You Danish pricks, you tricked us!
Bedrager
We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program.
Gerald
You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
Bedrager
[takes out his phone] By all means, [tosses the phone to Gerald] contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.
Dick
What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager
We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark! [punches a railing]
Dick
You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
Unknown supermarket. Garrison and Secret Service agents enter the store.
Garrison
Hey everybody! [walks to a checkout line, takes a mic, and hums "Hail To The Chief"] Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States. [mic drop, then walks around the store] Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice. [takes a small bottle of water from her shopping basket and opens it, tossing the cap away] Hello, Stephen.
Stephen
[looks away] Mr. President.
Garrison
[walks around the store some more] I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood [checks out a tomato paste can from another shopper] thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President.
First General
Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.
Garrison
Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez.
First General
Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.
Garrison
War?
Ike's room, day. He's playing a first-person shooter game when a Skype call comes in.
Gerald
Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?
The other trolls witness Gerald's actions.
Dick
Wow.
Anonymous821
Wow, what?
Dick
He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
Gerald
[covers his phone and faces the other trolls] If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called "using your brain", fatso!
Anonymous821
So they'll blame your kid?
Gerald
Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?
Dick
[stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
Gerald
You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in "You should all get raped by gorillas". You got that pal? Ike, "You should all get raped by gorillas"! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!
SpaceX. Heidi and Cartman sit next to each other on separate chairs.
Cartman
Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
Heidi
You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.
Cartman
I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
Butters
Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]
Cartman
[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
Butters
Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.
Cartman
Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
Butters
[shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse.
Outside of the White House. Memberberries start incoherent 'membering.
Memberberries
'Member The Fugitive? [Millions of Memberberries are 'membering.] 'Member Aliens? [They begin to jump the fence] Here we are! Ah, yeah! I 'member. Come on, everybody, 'member? [The large group of Memberberries continue 'membering.] 'Member snow speeders? [They approach the front door.] Yeah, I 'member! 'Member not hearing? [They breach the front door and pour into the main foyer.] 'Member the invasion of Hoth? Haha! 'Member "you rebel scum"? I 'member! [They fill the entire floor of the White House entrance.] Oh, 'member the rebel transports? [Thousands of Memberberries open the door to the Oval Office, and pour in.]
Memberberry 1
"We did it!" 'Member? [Five Memberberries take their place on the president's desk.]
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member!
Memberberry 3
What do we do now?
Memberberry 4
Don't you 'member?
Tubbs
Ooh, I 'member.
Ike's room. Ike sets up the profile photo of Mrs. Herrera and a penis in a small Photoshop tab while Gerald is on Skype.
Gerald
Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?
Ike
[puts penis in photoshopped mouth]
Gerald
Now I need you to type "You're a fat retard" in the comments.
Ike
[types in the comment section] "You're a retard."
Gerald
No, you have to say "a fat retard", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!
Ike
[types in the comment section] "You are a fat retard."
Sheila
[sees what Ike is doing and is in shock] Ike! What are you doing?!
Ike
What he says.
Gerald
[exits Skype chat]
Sheila
[walks into Ike's room and gets a closer look] It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?! [answers the call on her phone] Yes yes, hello?!
Gerald
[talks on his phone to Sheila] Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?
Sheila
You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!
Gerald
Are you serious?
Sheila
Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!
Gerald
God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
Shelia
[hands her phone to Ike]
Ike
Hello?
Gerald
Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside".
Ike
No!
Gerald
Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"!
Ike
[angrily] I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
Gerald
That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom.
Sheila
[takes her phone back] Gerald?!
Gerald
He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!
Sheila
I know!
Gerald
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?
Sheila
Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye. [ends the call and talks to Ike] You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! [leaves Ike's room]
Gerald
[starts a Skype call on Ike's computer] Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type "How'd you like a donkey dick?".
Pentagon. Garrison and four Secret Service agents walk to the general.
First General
[salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please.
Garrison
[follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?
First General
Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information.
Garrison
[takes folder] Okay, good.
First General
[stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]
Garrison
Thanks!
[everyone continues walking]
First General
In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
Garrison
Oh that will come in handy.
First General
Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.
Garrison
Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.
First General
[gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous "football", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]
Garrison
Love me some football. [follows the general]
First General
[stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]
People in the room are noticing high alerts across the world.
Garrison
Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.
Second General
Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
SpaceX. Butters sits next to Cartman by his left side.
Butters
Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.
Cartman
Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
Butters
No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.
Cartman
Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
Butters
Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?
Heidi
Oh yeah, that movie was funny.
Butters
Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
Heidi
Wow, I guess you're right.
Cartman
Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
Butters
Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.
Cartman
[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
Heidi
What, babe?
Cartman
Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
Heidi
[giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
Cartman
Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
Heidi
Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?
Butters
[laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]
The Pentagon
Second General
All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.
Garrison
Why? What the hell happened?
First General
This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
Garrison
What's TROLL TRACE?
First General
A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
Second General
The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work.
First General
The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
Second General
We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
Garrison
For what?
First General
Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.
Third General
Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.
Garrison
Well, why are you asking me?
Second General
Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.
The Kremlin, Russia, day. What follows is what's on the video, although the language is said to be Russian.
Aide 1
Президент Путин, Датское утверждает, что они всё ещё готовы включить программу Troll Trase.
Putin
Это всё, что я сказай, всё, что я сделай на Интернет будет доступно моей подруге?
Aide 1
Да, кажется так.
Putin
Датское должно быть оставновлены! Мы нужно знать, как Соединённые Штаты стоят на этом! [behind him, the phone rings at his desk and a second aide pops in to answer it]
Aide 2
Э... Господин президент, Овальный кабинет. [Putin walks to the phone]
Putin
Да, это президент Путин.
Memberberry 3
'Member the Death Star?
Memberberry 1
Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?
Memberberry 4
Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? [the berries chuckle]
Putin
Что это такое?
Tubbs
Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
Member McGy-?
Tubbs
Sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 3
'Member?
Memberberry 2
Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?
Memberberry 1
Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
SpaceX, day. Everyone is still waiting for the ride to Mars.
Tour Assistant
Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through.
Cartman
[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
Butters
Hey, that's me too. Yippee!
Tour Assistant
Right in here, everyone. [The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]
Elon Musk
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?
Cartman
Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
Elon Musk
And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?
PA Door Voice
[interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]
Elon Musk
The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.
Cartman
[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
Elon Musk
Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
Cartman
Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
Meanwhile, at the Pentagon...
Staffer 1
Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.
Garrison
Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
Staffer 2
[in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.
Garrison
Well what does that even mean?!
Staffer 3
[in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.
Garrison
I don't know, jeez!
First General
Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
Garrison
What?
Boris Johnson
Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.
UK Aide
[overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
Garrison
Memberries?
Boris Johnson
I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.
UK Aide
We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
Boris Johnson
The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.
Garrison
Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]
UK Aide
What'd he say?
Boris Johnson
I believe they've eaten the memberries.
UK Aide
Ooh, dear!
UK Aide 2
Ooh, dear!
SpaceX tour, day. The tour is winding down.
Elon Musk
Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Groups
Huh?
Cartman
Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
Elon Musk
Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
Groups
Awwww.
Cartman
No, no nonono, we have to go now!
Elon Musk
Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]
Butters
Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]
Elon Musk
Like... how funny?
The White House. Some member berries have formed a group and are performing "Africa". A vintage car horn is heard and the mob boss arrives with some henchmen. "Sing Sing Sing" blares from the radio.
Don
Out of the way, 'member?
Berry Henchmen
You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]
Memberberries
Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]
Don
Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 3
We decided he's in charge.
Memberberry 1
No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 4
No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]
Memberberry 2
Oh yeah, I 'member.
Don
Wrong. [shoots Member Berry 2 clear through. Member Berry 2 collapses and bleeds out green juice]
Memberberry 3
Waaah!
Don
'Member stormtroopers?
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member.
Don
Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
The Broflovski house. Kyle comes home from school and is about to go upstairs when he sees Ike in a corner, in time out. Ike has his head against the wall.
Kyle
Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?
Sheila
Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
Kyle
Well what'd he do?
Sheila
It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!
Kyle
What?
Sheila
It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]
Kyle
You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
Kyle stops and thinks back to the clues he's heard in recent days.
Heidi
I call it "Emoji Analysis". It isn't a student, it's an adult.
Sheila
This ugliness came from our family!
Heidi
I think it's one of the parents.
Gerald
You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
Ike
Daddy called you a pussy.
Kyle
[stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]
Sheila
Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! [her voice echoes around the neighborhood]
Not Funny
In front of Park County Police Station. A crowd gets riled up while Harrison starts a speech.
Harrison
Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me.
[crowd stops chattering]
Unknown person
Really?
Harrison
Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge.
[crowd chatters]
Harrison
[raises his arms] But, but,
[crowd stops]
Harrison
we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else [lays arms on stand] to add to that database. If we could all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories, [looks at Maggie] Maggie, okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling, [looks straight ahead] then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins.
Stephen
And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like [points at Laura] Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?
Laura
Excuse me?
Harrison
And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace, [looks at Maggie] Maggie. We have to stay in control. [looks in front of him] This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people.
[crowd panics and runs away]
Harrison
Guess I could've worded that differently.
Kyle's room. Kyle sits on bed with his head lowered while Sheila stands near the doorway.
Sheila
[yells] What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
Kyle
I just felt bad for him, ma.
Sheila
You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home! [leaves the room and closes the door]
Ike's room. Ike sits on his bed miserably. He suddenly gets a Skype call from Gerald. Ike goes to his computer and accepts the call.
Gerald
Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you? [paces] You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?
Kyle
[goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.
Gerald
[gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?
Kyle
It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble.
Gerald
No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...
Kyle
Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
Gerald
[starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down.
Kyle
[talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?
Gerald
Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!
Kyle
Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
Gerald
Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them.
Kyle
How?!
Gerald
Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]
Sheila
[enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!
Ike
[puts his head down]
Outside of SpaceX. SpaceX is surrounded by a barb-wired gate in which a crowd of people get riled up behind it, with some trying to climb.
Secretary
Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny.
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations.
Cartman
[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?
Heidi
[grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.
Cartman
Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
Heidi
Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.
Cartman
[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
Heidi
[sighs]
Elon Musk
Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?
Cartman
[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]
Elon Musk
This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
Cartman
Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
Elon Musk
I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
Cartman
Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.
Butters
[sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.
Cartman
[faces Butters with a mad face]
TrollTrace: vault. The vault door gets unlocked.
Dick
Here they come.
[Dane 2 opens the door as Bedrager, Dane 1, Dane 4, and him enter. The trolls stand up]
Gerald
Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!
Dane 2
[points a gun at the trolls]
Bedrager
All of you, remove your clothes.
Anonymous821
What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager
Remove your clothes now!
[the trolls strip themselves naked]
TrollTrace: Observatory room. The entrance door opens.
Dane 2
[enters] In here, move.
[trolls enter the room in a line where they are put on separate chairs, handcuffed]
Gerald
[gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!
[the door closes]
South Park Church. Maxi makes a speech to people praying.
Maxi
Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray.
Everyone
[speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online.
Harrison
Maggie.
Men
Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public.
Kyle
[enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?
Ike
[follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!
Kyle
Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it.
Randy
Yeah.
Kyle
[stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
Randy
Yeah, fuck Denmark.
Prayers
[speak after one another] Yeah!
Kyle
You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action.
Prayers
[speak in disappointment] Aw!
Stephen
The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
Randy
No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to.
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room.
First General
Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.
Garrison
Well what do they want me to do about it?
Second General
You're the leader of the free world. Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
Army Soldier
[salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3.
Garrison
Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.
Mr. Slave
[talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?
Garrison
Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?
Mr. Slave's house is shown to have other South Park residents.
Mr. Slave
No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark.
Garrison
Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
Mr. Slave
Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
Garrison
Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries.
Mr. Slave
Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch.
Garrison
Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!
Mr. Slave
You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody.
Garrison
I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I...
Mr. Slave
Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do.
Garrison
If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will...
Mr. Slave
You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy.
Ike
Pussy ass bitch.
Mr. Slave
Pussy ass bitch, fuck you.
Garrison
Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!
First General
Sir?
Garrison
[turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!
Mr. Slave
[talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked.
Kyle
Alright!
[everyone else cheered]
SpaceX. Butters walks to the men's room.
Butters
[talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]
Cartman
[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
Butters
[talks to Cartman] Going pee!
Cartman
I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
Butters
Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
Cartman
Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...
Butters
Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart.
Cartman
What are you talking about?
Butters
That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.
Cartman
Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
Butters
Sure buddy, sure.
Ike's room. Kyle and Ike read the news on the computer.
Kyle
Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent.
Ike
Yay!
Kyle
The President stated that since then...
Sheila
[enters the room] Are you serious right now?!
Kyle & Ike
Augh! [get off the chair]
Sheila
[yells] Get off that computerrrr!
Kyle
Ma, we were just using it to look at the news.
Sheila
I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!
Kyle
I'm not against you, mom.
Sheila
You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!
Kyle & Ike
Yes, mom.
Sheila
And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling.
Kyle & Ike
[in complete shock] Denmark?
Kyle
What is dad doing in Denmark?!
Sheila
The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]
Ike
Ohhh shit.
TrollTrace: Observatory room. The trolls are handcuffed and seated, facing the panels. Gerald is sobbing.
Gerald
[whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]
Anonymous821
Will somebody shut him up?
Dick
Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself
Gerald
You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)
Dick
Come on. You're not an asshole
Gerald
[sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.
Dick
Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects.
Gerald
[sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry
Trolls
That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right
Gerald
[calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?
TrollTrace: monitoring room. Bedrager is looking over a TrollTrace employee's notes, while the trolls are shown on the monitor
Gerald
Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?
Bedrager
[stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi continues to stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations. Cartman walks over and observes her from a distance
Heidi
[sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this.
Cartman
[walks away in shock]
SpaceX: Upper level walkway. Butters is leaning against the railing.
Cartman
[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
Butters
Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us.
Cartman
[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
Butters
The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.
Cartman
[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
TrollTrace: Conference room. Bedrager is eating a meal while two Danes stand guard.
Gerald
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me.
Bedrager
[continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too.
Gerald
And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like "Whoa!" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society.
Bedrager
You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
Gerald
If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --
Bedrager
You really think my plan is to kill you?
Gerald
It's not?
Bedrager
[To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[The two Danes walk out of the room.]
Bedrager
[In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room. Staff is running around and Mr. Garrison is eating a tub of ice cream.
First General
Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe.
Second General
Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
Garrison
[Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here.
Army Soldier
Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3.
Garrison
Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
[Walks over to red phone and picks up the receiver]
Garrison
This is the President
Kyle
[in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!
Garrison
Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle.
Kyle
It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
Garrison
Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here.
Kyle
[Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
Garrison
Excuse me?
Kyle
Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
Garrison
Who told you that?
Kyle
Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
Garrison
Kyle, I am the President.
Kyle
You're a little dipshit president.
Ike
With a dirty...asshole.
Kyle
With a dirty asshole.
Ike
And...you shit out your dick.
Kyle
And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?
Ike
Daddy!
Garrison
Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?
Kyle
Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch.
Garrison
[Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
Outside of SpaceX. A large crowd is making noise and still trying to get in
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi continues to stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations, with Elon Musk and his staff observing. Cartman walks up to her from behind
Cartman
[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
Heidi
[Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns.
Cartman
[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
Heidi
And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing.
[As Heidi continues staring at the board, the formulas start changing into random emojis]
Heidi
[Thinking] I call it [echo] "Emoji Analysis" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues].
Cartman
Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember.
Heidi
These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.
Cartman
Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
Heidi
[Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
[the Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker review his clipboard notes]
SpaceX Employee
I'm sorry?
Heidi
That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
[the employees review their notes again]
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
[Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
Cartman
Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"?
Heidi
[Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]
Cartman
What the fuck is happening?
TrollTrace: Conference room. Gerald is sitting at the conference table as Bedrager stands by a cart with wine and wine glasses.
Bedrager
[picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?
Gerald
And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that.
Bedrager
[pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?
Gerald
I-I don't understand.
Bedrager
What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish.
Gerald
No way.
Bedrager
Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
[Bedrager walks over to a microphone and starts talking over the P.A. system]
Bedrager
[speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
Gerald
You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!
Bedrager
Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?
Gerald
That's not funny.
Bedrager
That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!
Gerald
You can't do this to people! It's not right!
Bedrager
[chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]
TrollTrace: Assembly hall. Employees standing around, waiting for the show.
[Two Danes try to access a door with their access card, but are denied access and try manually opening the door with a crank handle. The wall panels slide back and show the remaining trolls in the Observatory room, who can also see the TrollTrace employees.]
Dick
What the fuck is going on?!
[The trolls and TrollTrace employees look at each other, before an overhead project starts up and a countdown begins on the panels. The music video for "Never Gonna Give You Up" then starts up]
Music video
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
TrollTrace Employee
Uh-oh.
["Never Gonna Give You Up" continues playing in the background]
Dick
Wow. That's pretty impressive.
TrollTrace: Conference room. Bedrager quickly walks out of the conference room as Gerald tries to stop him.
Gerald
Waaiitt!!!
[Bedrager smiles as the doors shut and he slides his access card to lock the doors, trapping Gerald inside. He tries to break the glass doors open as Bedrager happily walks away.]
Ike's room. Ike is looking out the snow covered window with a candle nearby
Kyle
[standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now.
Ike
I know.
Kyle
Just remember--I always loved you, little brother.
Ike
I love you too, big brother.
Kyle
Let's...just get this over with.
Sheila's bedroom. Sheila is reading a book in bed. Ike comes up to her door and she notices him
Ike
Mommy?
Sheila
Yes?
Ike
Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]
Sheila
[angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!
[Ike hops down the staircase and runs into the kitchen with Sheila behind him]
Sheila
[yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!
Kyle
He's in the pantry.
Sheila
[yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt! What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]
Kyle
Ma. Mom, we are really sorry...
Sheila
[yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle
But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers
Sheila
[yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle
We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now.
Sheila
[continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]

The End of Serialization as We Know It
The Pentagon, President-Elect Garrison is approached by two members of the military.
General Revaur
Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your "stank face".
Mr. Garrison
Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
Military Officer
The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!
NSA Agent
[From a nearby workstation.] Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website.
Mr. Garrison
[Joyously.] A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?
NSA Agent
It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir.
Broflovski Residence. Kyle sits in Gerald's office typing away, a can of Sprite nearby. "Smokin'" by the rock band "Boston" plays loudly.
Kyle
Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?
Token pops up in a Skype window on the computer.
Token
I'm here, what's this about Kyle?
Kyle
I can't tell you dude, I just need your
Smokin'

help...Please, my life depends
Smokin'

on it.
Token
Okay, okay sure.
I feel alright, mamma...

Kyle
Alright,
I'm not jokin', yeah

I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people.
Token
What!?
Kyle
Token, please! There's no time to explain!
Token
Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
Kyle
That helps thank you.
Kyle closes Token's window and brings up Craig and Tweek.
Kyle
Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people.
Craig
Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
Kyle
It's not important, just get on it and respond.
A popup appears, Stan Marsh is ringing Kyle on Skype. Kyle closes, Tweek and Craig, and brings Stan up.
Kyle
[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!
Stan
For what?
Kyle
Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!
Stan
[Pumped up] Okay!
Kyle closes Stan's window and brings up Jimmy Valmer.
Kyle
Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?
Jimmy
Wuh-Wuh-Waddle back to Syria you desert-tard. [Jimmy smiles gleefully]
A door is nailed shut by numerous pieces of wood and the door handle is wedged securely with a chair. On the other side, someone is trapped, jostling the handle and shaking the door.
Sheila
You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
TrollTrace Headquarters. Gerald is locked in the conference room. Risk Astley is still blaring over the large television.
Never gonna give, never gonna give, give you up
Never gonna give, never gonna give, give you up
We've known each other,
Static interrupts the song.
for so long
Static interrupts again and Dildo Shwaggins is seen.
Dildo Shwaggins
Skank
Gerald
Dildo?
Dildo Shwaggins
Skankhunt, can you hear me?
Gerald
Yes! Yes, where are you?
Dildo Shwaggins
The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
Gerald
How long before the website goes online?
Danish Worker
Less than ten mienutes.
Gerald
Oh God!
Dildo Shwaggins
Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate.
Dildo Shwaggins
Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account.
Gerald
My account?
Dildo Shwaggins
Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people.
Gerald realizes that Kyle is using his account to help save him.
Gerald
[Proudly.] That's my boy!
Back at SpaceX, Heidi, Elon Musk and some SpaceX employees look at a chamber containing fast flowing energy.
Female SpaceX Worker
The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars.
Elon Musk
This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?
Heidi
I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
She looks over to where Cartman is and waves. Cartman half-heartedly waves back.
Elon Musk
Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you.
She and Elon Musk walk off, Cartman stands next to Butters with a troubled look on his face.
Cartman
Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
Butters
Yep.
Cartman
We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
Butters
Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
Cartman
It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?
Cartman
Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Sure, about what?
Cartman
The end of our species.
Back in Gerald's office in Kyle's house.
Kyle
All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?
Kevin
Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to.
Kenny
(Me too dude, what's next?)
Ike pops up in a window.
Ike
Kyle, I wanna help tooo.
Kyle
No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say.
Dildo Shwaggins pops up in a window.
Dildo Shwaggins
Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
Kyle
Who are you?
Dildo Shwaggins
I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you.
Kyle
O-- Okay?
Dildo Shwaggins
Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too.
Kyle
What the hell is "Trevor's Axiom"?
An NSA Agent stands next to a dry-erase board with a pointer. On the board reads "Trevor's Axiom" under which is a tree of circled letters, breaking off into tiers, representing users.
NSA Agent
Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
The people the NSA Agent is talking to are shown, seated at the table are President-Elect Garrison, sporting his "Stank-Face", some NSA Agents, General Revaur, and his associate.
NSA Agent
It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C.
NSA Agent
Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity.
Mr. Garrison
Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected.
NSA Agent
Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers...
General Revaur
[Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.
Mr. Garrison
Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll.
SpaceX: Interior. Cartman and Butters are sitting at a table across from the male #OccupyMars SpaceX worker
Cartman
Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
You keep saying that, but not why.
Butters
Because Eric knows the future.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
What are you talking about?
Cartman
I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
He hops off the chair and walks to the other side of the room.
Cartman
But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
Cartman has a vision, and the red surface of Mars is now shown, as he dictates his vision.
Cartman (Voiceover)
At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand.
Cartman is is in a spacesuit, jumping around saying "Cool".
Cartman
Everyone will be really nice.
Cartman jumps down from a small hill and notices a futuristic structure with some female astronauts nearby. They both wave to Cartman as he hops past the structure.
Female 1
Hi!
Female 2
Hi!
Cartman
Hi!
Cartman reaches the bottom of the hill as a rover drives past him.
Cartman
You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
The rover is now driving towards a futuristic amusement park.
Cartman
But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
Cartman looks around and notices a parked rover with 4 women smiling and waving to him.
Cartman
Hmm, let's see
Cartman hops in their direction.
Cartman
And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?"
He quickly hops past a group of girls and young women. An image of Butters' head in a space helmet zooms past Cartman. Butters voice is heard.
Butters
[Whispering] Look underground.
Butter's voice echoes as Cartman hops toward an underground mine entrance.
Cartman
And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
Cartman stops and examines the entrance, then proceeds inside.
Cartman
What is this place?
Cartman
And that's when you'll learn the truth...
A chamber unfolds in front of Cartman, it is filled with exhausted, naked men who have hoses attached to their penises. Each of them are standing in front of a station housing a reservoir of their semen and a laptop computer resides in front of each of them.
Cartman
Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
The naked men are struggling to type on their laptops while being drained of their semen.
Cartman
They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
Cartman continues watching, as two women come up from behind, and grab him.
Cartman
What?! No, no!
One of the women removes Cartman's helmet.
Cartman
You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
Soon, Cartman has been stripped of his clothes and is now naked, attached to a station.
Cartman
Nooooooo! No, no!
A woman in a spacesuit is standing behind him, yelling at him.
Female 3
Write jokes!
Cartman starts typing on the laptop, wimpering.
Cartman
No! No!
SpaceX: Interior. Cartman's vision ends.
Cartman
And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men.
Cartman
If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
They all look up at two female SpaceX employees that walk by. The girls stop and notice the guys staring at them.
Female SpaceX Employee
What?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
What?
Cartman hops back on chair, whispering.
Cartman
You have to help us stop this!
TrollTrace:Conference Room. Gerald is trying different access codes to open the door, but is consistently rejected
Gerald
[Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!
Dildo Shwaggins
Skank! You still there?
Gerald
[He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here.
TrollTrace:Assembly Hall. Dildo Shwaggins is sitting at a computer with the rest of the trolls and TrollTrace staff
Dildo Shwaggins
The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.
Gerald
[He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.
TrollTrace employee
Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9...
Gerald
[He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?
TrollTrace employee
That's it. 9.
Gerald
[Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]
Broflovski Residence. Sheila is still trying to break open the kitchen pantry door.
Sheila
[She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah!
Sheila eventually break the kitchen pantry door with her bodyweight. She comes out looking disheveled and breathing heavily, before yelling in frustration.
TrollTrace:Locker Room. Gerald runs in and stops at a locker to grab a uniform. He then proceeds up the ladder in the server room
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?
Gerald
Yeah, I'm up with all the servers.
TrollTrace:Assembly Hall. Dildo Shwaggins is sitting at a computer with the rest of the trolls and TrollTrace staff
TrollTrace employee
The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?
Gerald
[notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off
Gerald pulls the lever down, causing an alarm to go off.
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.
Ike's room. Ike is on the computer with a headset.
Ike
You are all dumbass fuckwads.
An angry Sheila starts to slowly come up to Ike's door and then into his room
Ike
Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch.
Sheila
Ike!
Ike
Aah!
Sheila
[Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!
Sheila charges at Ike, but he manages to slide and crawl under her nightgown. She then grabs his computer monitor and slams it down
Ike
Mommy!
Sheila
[Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!
Ike
Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]
Sheila follows Ike into the hallway and starts screaming
Gerald's office. Kyle is typing on the computer just as Ike pushes the door open
Ike
Kyle!
Sheila
Ike!
Kyle
[He throws down headset.] Shit!
Ike
Mommy got out!
Kyle gets off the chair and tries to shield Ike from Sheila
Sheila
[Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!
Kyle
Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--
Sheila
Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
Sheila charges at the boys, but Kyle and Ike side step her and move towards the window.
Kyle
Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent
Sheila
[Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!
Kyle
No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]
Sheila
You both march out of here, right now!
Kyle
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family
Kyle grabs Ike and pulls the ripcord on his vests, launching both of them out the window. Sheila then runs over to the window and looks on in shock.
SpaceX:Exterior. A large group of people are making noise outside the entrance.
SpaceX:Interior. The Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker is walking alongside Elon Musk.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Go on, tell Elon.
Cartman
Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
Elon Musk
For what?
Cartman
What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
Elon Musk
That's two things.
Cartman
They're pretty related.
Elon Musk
Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
Cartman
Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
Butters
I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it.
Cartman
It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
Cartman turns around and notices Heidi looking at him through the glass partition.
Cartman
They can live without us. We can't live without them.
Heidi waves to Cartman and he waves to her with a smile. She then walks away
Cartman
If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?
Copy and Print: Exterior. Kyle and Ike are inside, with Kyle trolling on the computer.
Kyle
Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care.
Ike
You fat hooker.
Kyle
You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out.
Ike
You clean your fucking mouth out.
Stan pops up on a FaceTime window
Kyle
Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!
Stan
Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town.
Kyle
Shit!
A FaceTime notification from "The President" pops up
Kyle
Hold on...
Mr. Garrison pops up on a FaceTime window.
Mr. Garrison
Kyle?!
Kyle
[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President
Mr. Garrison
Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!
Kyle
Uh...what do you mean?
Mr. Garrison
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
Kyle
[Surprised.] It is?
Mr. Garrison
Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up.
Kyle
[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?
The skies of Denmark. Tjing Tjang Tjing is heard as Lennart Bedrager is flying a helicopter with a grin on his face. As he looks at his phone, his expression changes into shock as he sees video of Gerald shutting down the servers.
Bedrager
Oh, no, you don't.
Bedrager turns the helicopter around and heads back to the TrollTrace building.
South Park: Residential neighborhood. People are panicking and running around on the streets. Sheila walks up to the Tucker residence and knocks on the door.
Sheila
Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me.
Laura is sobbing.
Sheila
What? What? What?
Laura
[She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.
Laura walks away from the door into the living room. A confused Sheila follows her into the house
Laura
When you marry someone and you think you know them...
Sheila
I don't know what you're talking about.
Laura
TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]
Laura
It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]
Laura
I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!
Sheila
May I use this a moment?
Laura
Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
Sheila takes a seat and accesses The TrollTrace website. She starts to type in Ike's name and all his personal information. A detailed list of websites with date and time stamps appears in front of her. She starts to scroll down the list and is shocked at what she sees.
SpaceX:Exterior. A large group of people are making noise outside the entrance.
SpaceX:Interior. Butters is standing around while Cartman is nervously pacing back and forth.
Cartman
What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Butters
Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
Cartman
If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
Butters' phone rings and he becomes mad as he answers it.
Butters
What?!
Kyle
Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
Butters
Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?
Kyle
SpaceX? Why?!
Butters
Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
Kyle
[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?
Butters
Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
Cartman
[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?
Cartman
[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now.
Kyle
Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other.
TrollTrace:Server Room. Gerald is moving up another ladder in the server room
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?
Gerald is at the last walkway and is staring at a path leading to a mechanical door.
Gerald
I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
TrollTrace employee
That last breaker should be there
Gerald
Heading to it now!
Gerald begins to sprint across the bridgeway, but stops as he sees the figure of Lennart Bedrager standing at the door.
Bedrager
I'm ten steps ahead of you!
Gerald is in shock, as Lennart Bedrager emerges from the shadows with a gun pointed at him.
Bedrager
What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?
The TrollTrace server room is starting to fall apart
Gerald
Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
Bedrager
What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
Gerald
It's completely heartless and malicious!
Bedrager
You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?
Gerald
No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
Bedrager
How is not satirical?
The TrollTrace server room continues to fall apart, causing explosions and flying debris, as the bridgway starts to shake, knocking both of them back.
Tucker residence: Living room. As Laura looks out the window, Sheila is still in shock at the TrollTrace results she's looking at.
Sheila
There's nothing here.
The TrollTrace results for Ike continue to scroll before finally stopping.
Sheila
Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]
Sheila
Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
Laura
About what?
Sheila
I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]
Laura
Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]
Laura
My husband was on three "married-but-dating" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?
Sheila thinks about Laura's question while looking at the TrollTrace website on the laptop.
Sheila
No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy.
Laura
Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]
Laura
Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room. One employee who is on fire runs across the room unnoticed by the staff. Two NSA agents are typing while Mr. Garrison and the Army generals stand near them
NSA Agent
There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
Army General 2
Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker.
Mr. Garrison
Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
Soldier
[He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle.
Mr. Garrison
[He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work.
Kyle
[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?
Mr. Garrison
SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
Kyle
[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, that's dumb, but go on.
TrollTrace: Server room. The rooms continues to fall apart while Gerald and Lennart try to keep their balance as the bridegway starts to shake from the explosions.
Gerald
Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?
Bedrager
That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
Gerald
No, but see, that's just nihilism.
Bedrager
Oh, come on!
Gerald
That is!
Bedrager
So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!
Another explosion causes them to try and regain their balance again.
Gerald
You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
Bedrager
So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
Another explosion causes them to move back slightly and keep their balance
SpaceX: Assembly line. An alarm goes off as Cartman speaks over the P.A. system.
Cartman
Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]
Cartman
Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]
Cartman
We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]
Cartman
The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?
Heidi
There's a bomb threat?
Cartman
Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]
Heidi
Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately.
As Cartman starts talking, Butters and the male #OccupyMars SpaceX employee look on while bringing a large yellow hose to the chamber
Cartman
Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
Heidi
Did I do something wrong?
Cartman
[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]
Heidi
You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?
Cartman
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
As Heidi starts talking, Cartman focuses on Butters and the male #OccupyMars SpaceX employee who has attached the hose to one of the chamber's valve and making adjustments.
Heidi
Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.
Cartman
Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]
Cartman
Now come on we got to get outside.
Tucker residence. The TrollTrace website is seen as Sheila hesitates about entering Gerald's information. She then begins to slowly type his name in
Sheila
I shouldn't do this.
TrollTrace: Server room. Gerald has his back turned to Lennart Bedrager
Gerald
I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]
Gerald
All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]
Gerald
I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]
Gerald
I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference.
Gerald hops forward and kicks Lennart Bedrager between his legs, causing him to drop down in pain. Gerald then grabs him by his jacket and tosses him off the bridgeway.
Bedrager
Noooooo!!!
Gerald
Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!
Gerald then moves towards the final lever and pulls it down, causing an alarm to go off.
Copy and Print. Dildo Shwaggins is FaceTiming with Kyle and Ike
Dildo Shwaggins
That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
Kyle
Mr. President, do it!
Mr. Garrison
Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
Pentagon Employee
Rerouting now!
SpaceX: Interior. The chamber begins to violently shake and beep, eventually exploding and sending a massive fireball throughout the entire SpaceX factory.
Tucker residence. Sheila has typed in all of Gerald's information and slowly presses the "Return" key to start the search. As the results start to compile, the screen starts to flicker and then the screen shuts down. The shutdown then proceeds to Copy and Print, TrollTrace and the Pentagon, leaving everyone with a black screen that reads "Internet Reset Global Cache Cleared F:\>
Sheila
[She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!
SpaceX: Exterior. The entire SpaceX building is exploding and everyone is running away. From a hill, Elon Musk and a few SpaceX employees are watching in horror, along with Cartman, Heidi and Butters.
Cartman
Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
Elon is oblivious to Cartman's remark as he continues watching SpaceX explode in front of him.
Cartman
Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
Heidi
Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?
Cartman
Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
Heidi
Well, what do you mean?
Cartman
It was a joke.
South Park: Residential area. The Stotch residence is shown, with Stephen and Linda Stotch opening the door and looking up to the sky. Kyle starts narrating.
Kyle (voiceover)
And so, life goes on.
South Park: The Tweak residence. Tweak and his parents step outside their house.
Kyle (voiceover)
The end of civilization didn't happen.
South Park: Residential area. A large group of residents, including Thomas and Linda Tucker and Richard Alder, are stepping outside, looking around, talking to each other, shaking hands and giving each other hugs.
Kyle (voiceover)
A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
South Park: Residential area. Broflovski residence. A taxi pulls up to the curb with Gerald inside.
Kyle (voiceover)
We've been given a second chance.
Gerald exits the taxi and makes his way to the front door. He open the door and steps inside into the living room
Kyle (voiceover)
A mulligan.
Ike and Kyle look on as Sheila quickly runs over and gives him a hug.
Kyle (voiceover)
Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever.
Ike and Kyle angrily stare at Gerald. He smiles at them and gives them a thumbs-up. Kyle's expression then changes into annoyance.
South Park: Bus Stop. A large bus pulls up to its next stop.
Kyle (voiceover)
Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
The bus comes to a stop and opens its door. Two adults, followed by Heidi and Cartman step off the bus. Heidi smiles at Cartman but Cartman looks at her with mistrust.
South Park: The Turner residence. Cartman and Heidi are walking together, holding hands, while Mr. and Mrs. Turner look on from their front door
Kyle (voiceover)
Realize how careful our online lives have to be.
Cartman and Heidi stop in front of her house. Heidi, with a smile on her face, kisses a bitter-looking Cartman on his cheek, before walking up to her parents and going inside their residence. He then wipes her kiss off of his cheek with his hand.
The White House: Front lawn.
Kyle (voiceover)
Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality.
The White House: Oval Office. A large group of Memberberries stand at attention while Mr. Garrison walks over to his desk and takes his seat as the President.
Marsh Residence: Living room. Randy, Stan, Shelly, Sharron and Marvin Marsh, along with Sparky, are watching television together
Kyle (voiceover)
Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it.
News Anchor
And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida.
Beckett Residence: Front Porch. Dave Beckett is smoking a pipe and sitting on a rocking chair with a sleeping dog near his feet
News Reporter
Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?
Dave Beckett
Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut.
